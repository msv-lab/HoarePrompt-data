You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt



- Annotated Code: 
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: The loop terminates when `b` becomes 0, and `a` holds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, with `1 <= a <= n` still holding true.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, where `1 <= a <= n` is still true.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are positive integers within the ranges `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`. It returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`. After the function concludes, `a` holds the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is the sum of `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)` for all `i` from 1 to `m`, `i` is `m`, `x` is `n - (m * m - m)`, `y` is `m * m`.
    return cnt
    #The program returns the sum of `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)` for all `i` from 1 to `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) and returns an integer `cnt`. The value of `cnt` is the sum of a series of calculations performed for each integer `i` from 1 to `m`. For each `i`, the calculation is the ceiling of the division of `(n - (i * i - i))` by `(i * i)`, plus 1 if the remainder of this division is 0. After the function concludes, `cnt` holds the final result of these calculations, and the input variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The function `func_2` is attempting to count such pairs, but the logic is flawed.

For example, consider the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\). The expected output is 3, as the pairs (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2) satisfy the conditions. However, the program's logic does not correctly handle this case.

The program calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\), and then increments `cnt` by `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`. This logic does not correctly account for the conditions specified in the problem description.

To verify, let's manually check the pairs for \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):

- For \(a = 1\):
  - \(b = 1\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\). (Valid pair)
  - \(b = 2\): \(1 + 2 = 3\) is not a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2) = 2\). (Invalid pair)
  - \(b = 3\): \(1 + 3 = 4\) is not a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(1, 3) = 3\). (Invalid pair)

- For \(a = 2\):
  - \(b = 1\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\). (Valid pair)
  - \(b = 2\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\). (Valid pair)
  - \(b = 3\): \(2 + 3 = 5\) is not a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(2, 3) = 3\). (Invalid pair)

Thus, the valid pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2), which gives a total of 3 valid pairs. However, the program's logic does not correctly count these pairs, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
