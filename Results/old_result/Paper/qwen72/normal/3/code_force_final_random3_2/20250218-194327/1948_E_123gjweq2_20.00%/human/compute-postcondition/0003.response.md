The code snippet `not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid` calculates the value of `not_mid` based on the initial state. Let's break it down:

- `left` and `right` are non-negative integers with `left` <= `right`.
- `clique` is a positive integer (not directly used in the calculation).
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.

The value of `not_mid` is calculated as:
- `right - left + 1 - mid`

Given that `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, the expression `right - left + 1 - mid` simplifies to:
- `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`

This can be further simplified to:
- `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2 = (right - left + 1) - (right - left) // 2`

Since `(right - left) // 2` is the integer division of `right - left` by 2, the result of `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2` is the number of elements not in the middle.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - (right - left) // 2`.**
