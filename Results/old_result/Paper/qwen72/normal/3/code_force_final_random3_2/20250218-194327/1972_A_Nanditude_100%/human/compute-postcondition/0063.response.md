Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `j` is 2, `cnt` is 1 if `b[1]` is less than `a[0]`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, and `i` is 2.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
