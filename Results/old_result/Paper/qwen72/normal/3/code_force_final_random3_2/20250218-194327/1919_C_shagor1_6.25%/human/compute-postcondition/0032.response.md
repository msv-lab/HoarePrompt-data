Postcondition: **`_` is a temporary variable, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list, and `ans` is 0 if the first element of `inp` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `ans` is 1, 2, or 3. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, `x` is set to `a` and `y` remains `n + 1` or is set to the first element of `inp` if the first element is greater than `n + 1`. If `a` is greater than `x`, `ans` is 1 if the first element of `inp` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `ans` is 2 or 3. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, `y` is set to `a` and `x` remains unchanged. If `a` is greater than `y`, `y` is set to `a`. In all cases, `x` and `y` are updated according to the conditions, and `x == y` evaluates to `False` if `ans` is 1 or 2.**
