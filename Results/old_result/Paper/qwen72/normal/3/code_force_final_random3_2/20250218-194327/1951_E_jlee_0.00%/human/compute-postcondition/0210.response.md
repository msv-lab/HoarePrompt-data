Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string` and must have at least 1 character.
   - `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be greater than 0.
   - `x` is the first character of the new `s`.
   - `count2` is greater than `count`.
   - `count` is greater than 0.
   - `done` remains False unless the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`.
   - Additionally, the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(string[:j], string[j:])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement splits the `string` into two parts: `string[:j]` and `string[j:]`.
   - `j` is the index where the character in `s` is not equal to the character at the corresponding mirrored index `n - 1 - j` and also not equal to `x`.

4. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since `s` is a list of characters from `string`, and `n` is the length of `s`, the value of `j` is determined by the condition that the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s` and also not equal to `x`.
   - `string[:j]` will be the substring of `string` from the start up to but not including the character at index `j`.
   - `string[j:]` will be the substring of `string` starting from the character at index `j` to the end.

5. **Output:**
   - The exact value of `j` is not provided, but it is determined by the conditions mentioned.
   - Therefore, the output will be the split of `string` at the index `j` where the character at `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at `n - 1 - j` in `s` and also not equal to `x`.

Output: **[string[:j], string[j:]] (where j is the index in s where the character at index j is not equal to the character at index n - 1 - j and also not equal to x)**
