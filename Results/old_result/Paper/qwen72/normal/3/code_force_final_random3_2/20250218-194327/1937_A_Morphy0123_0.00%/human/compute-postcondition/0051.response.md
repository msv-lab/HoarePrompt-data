Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n_cases` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(power-1)}\).
   - `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{power} \geq n\).
   - The current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n_cases` is not directly relevant to the calculation of `2 ** power`.
   - `i` is 2, but it is also not directly relevant to the calculation of `2 ** power`.
   - `n` must satisfy the condition \(n \geq 2^{(power-1)}\).
   - `power` is defined as the smallest integer such that \(2^{power} \geq n\).
   - The current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

3. **Calculating `2 ** power`:**
   - Since `power` is equal to `n`, we need to substitute `n` for `power` in the expression `2 ** power`.
   - The expression becomes `2 ** n`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `2 ** n`.

Given the initial state, the value of `n` is equal to `power`, and `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{power} \geq n\). This means `n` is a power of 2. Therefore, `2 ** n` will be \(2^n\).

Output: **2 ** n (where n is the smallest integer such that \(2^n \geq n\))**
