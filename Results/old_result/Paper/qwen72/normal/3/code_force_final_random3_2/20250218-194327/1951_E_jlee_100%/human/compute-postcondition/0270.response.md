Let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`.
- `string` is the new input string.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 2.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `j` is 2.

### Conditions:
1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2, `done` remains unchanged, and `count2` remains unchanged.
2. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` remains unchanged, `count` remains unchanged, and `count2` is increased by 1.
3. If `count` is greater than 0, `done` is True.
4. If `count` is less than 1 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is set to 1 and `done` is True.
5. If `count` is less than 1 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count` remains unchanged, `count2` is increased by 1, and `done` remains unchanged.
6. If `count2 == count` and `count > 1`, `done` is True.
7. If `count2 == count` and `count <= 1`, `count2` is 0, `count` remains unchanged, and `done` remains unchanged.
8. If `count2 > count`, `done` is True.

### Analysis:
- We need to determine the values of `string[:j]` and `string[j:]` based on the initial state and the conditions.
- `j` is 2, so `string[:j]` will be the first 2 characters of `string`, and `string[j:]` will be the remaining characters of `string` starting from the third character.

### Step-by-Step Execution:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - `j` is 2.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - We need to check the conditions to see if they affect the values of `count`, `count2`, or `done`.
   - Since the conditions are complex and depend on the values of `s[j]`, `x`, `count`, and `count2`, we need to consider the possible outcomes:
     - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2.
     - If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `count2` is increased by 1.
     - If `count` is greater than 0, `done` is True.
     - If `count` is less than 1 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is set to 1 and `done` is True.
     - If `count` is less than 1 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1.
     - If `count2 == count` and `count > 1`, `done` is True.
     - If `count2 == count` and `count <= 1`, `count2` is 0.
     - If `count2 > count`, `done` is True.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - Regardless of the conditions, the `print` statement will always print the first 2 characters of `string` followed by the remaining characters starting from the third character.
   - The conditions only affect the values of `count`, `count2`, and `done`, but they do not change the slicing of `string`.

### Final Output:
- `string[:j]` will be the first 2 characters of `string`.
- `string[j:]` will be the remaining characters of `string` starting from the third character.

Output: **[first 2 characters of string], [remaining characters of string starting from the third character]**
