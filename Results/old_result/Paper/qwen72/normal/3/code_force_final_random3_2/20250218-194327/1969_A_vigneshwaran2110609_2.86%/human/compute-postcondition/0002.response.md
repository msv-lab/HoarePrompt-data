Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct; `i` is 0; `x` is an input integer.**

The variable `x` is assigned the value of an integer input by the user. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
