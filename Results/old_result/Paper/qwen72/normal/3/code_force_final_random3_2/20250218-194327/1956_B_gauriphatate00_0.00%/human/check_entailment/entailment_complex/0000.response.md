Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can score in a card game where you and Nene take turns placing cards on a table. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The key to solving this problem is to understand that the number of points you can score depends on the number of pairs of cards you have in your hand. If you have a pair, you can score a point when you place the second card of the pair, provided Nene hasn't already placed the matching card.

### Function 1 Analysis:
- **Input:** `n` (the number of cards you have) and `a` (the list of integers on your cards).
- **Output:** The maximum number of points you can score.
- **Logic:**
  - `counter = Counter(a)`: This creates a frequency counter for the integers in your hand.
  - `pairs = sum(1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2)`: This counts the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand.
  - `return min(pairs, n // 2)`: This returns the minimum of the number of pairs and half the number of cards you have. This is because you can only score points for up to half of your cards (since each turn you and Nene take one card each).

### Function 2 Analysis:
- **Input:** The function reads from `stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
- **Output:** The function prints the results of each test case.
- **Logic:**
  - `input = sys.stdin.read`: This reads all input at once.
  - `data = input().split()`: This splits the input into a list of strings.
  - `t = int(data[idx])`: This reads the number of test cases.
  - The loop iterates over each test case:
    - `n = int(data[idx])`: Reads the number of cards for the current test case.
    - `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))`: Reads the list of integers on your cards for the current test case.
    - `results.append(func_1(n, a))`: Calls `func_1` with the current test case's `n` and `a`, and appends the result to the `results` list.
  - Finally, the function prints each result in `results`.

### Overall Correctness:
- **Function 1** correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score by counting the pairs of cards in your hand and ensuring you don't exceed half the number of cards.
- **Function 2** correctly processes multiple test cases, reads the input, and calls `func_1` for each test case, then prints the results.

The logic and implementation of both functions align with the problem description and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
