Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `pans` is a list with at least `n` elements.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - If the user input is '<', `mak` is 2 and `mak2` is 0. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 and `mak2` remains 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The value of `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - The value of `mak` depends on the user input:
     - If the user input is '<', `mak` is 2.
     - Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.
   - The value of `mak2` is not relevant to the print statement.

4. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If the user input is '<', the print statement will output:
     ```python
     print('?', 2, 2, 3, 3)
     ```
     Output: **? 2 2 3 3**
   - If the user input is anything other than '<', the print statement will output:
     ```python
     print('?', 0, 0, 3, 3)
     ```
     Output: **? 0 0 3 3**

Since the user input is not specified in the initial state, we need to consider both possibilities. However, the task requires us to provide the most precise description possible based on the given information.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 3 3 (where [mak] is 2 if the user input is '<', otherwise [mak] is 0)**
