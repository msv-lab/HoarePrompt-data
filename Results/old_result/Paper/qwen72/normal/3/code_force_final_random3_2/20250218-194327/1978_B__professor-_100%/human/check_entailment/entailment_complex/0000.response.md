### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.

2. **Conditions and Logic**:
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**:
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, then the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit in this case is `n * a`.
     - This condition is correctly handled by the line `print(n * a)`.

   - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**:
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, then Bob can sell all buns at the modified prices starting from `b` down to `b - n + 1`.
     - The profit in this case is the sum of an arithmetic series: `b + (b-1) + (b-2) + ... + (b-n+1)`.
     - The sum of this series can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series: `S = n/2 * (first_term + last_term)`.
     - Here, the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - n + 1`, so the sum is `n/2 * (b + (b - n + 1)) = n/2 * (2b - n + 1)`.
     - This condition is correctly handled by the line `print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))`.

   - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**:
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, then Bob can only sell `b - a + 1` buns at the modified prices starting from `b` down to `a`.
     - The profit from these buns is the sum of the arithmetic series: `b + (b-1) + (b-2) + ... + a`.
     - The sum of this series can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `b - a + 1` terms of an arithmetic series: `S = (b - a + 1)/2 * (b + a)`.
     - The remaining `n - (b - a + 1)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `a * (n - (b - a + 1))` to the profit.
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts: `(b - a + 1)/2 * (b + a) + a * (n - (b - a + 1))`.
     - This condition is correctly handled by the line `print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))`.

3. **Output**: The function correctly prints the maximum profit for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as `b` being equal to `a` and `b - a` being greater than or equal to `n` correctly.
   - The function also handles large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` (up to \(10^9\)) correctly, as the arithmetic operations are valid and the results are within the integer range.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns, considering the different conditions and edge cases as described in the problem statement.
