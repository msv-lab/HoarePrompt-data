The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might use or process values `t` and `n` internally, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and `n` is an integer for each test case such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. The output of the function is not specified, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function is designed to operate with an implicit integer `t` (1 <= t <= 50) and an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10^3) for each test case, but the specific return value or output is not provided.**
