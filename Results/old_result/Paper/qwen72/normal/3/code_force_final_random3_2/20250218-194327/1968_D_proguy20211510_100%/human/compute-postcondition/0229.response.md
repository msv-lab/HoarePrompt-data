Output State: **`n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `preb`, `resb`, and `vis` remain unchanged except that `vis[ps - 1]` is now 1, and `paths` now includes the element `a[ps - 1]` at the end. `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`. If `vis[ps - 1]` was already 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `preb`, and `resb` remain unchanged. The value of `vis[ps - 1]` is now 1, and `paths` includes the element `a[ps - 1]` at the end. The value of `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`. If `vis[ps - 1]` was already 1 before the `break` statement, the loop or if statement is exited.
