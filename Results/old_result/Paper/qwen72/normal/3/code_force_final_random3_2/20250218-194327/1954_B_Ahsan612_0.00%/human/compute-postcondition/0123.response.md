Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from user input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `ar` of length `n`. It then calculates the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the same number in `ar`. If no such sequence exists, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of these sequences. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. **
