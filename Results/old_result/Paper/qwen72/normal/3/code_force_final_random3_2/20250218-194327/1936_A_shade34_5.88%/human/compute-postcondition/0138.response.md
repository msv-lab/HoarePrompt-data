The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the list `pans`. The loop iterates over the range starting from 1 to the length of `pans` minus 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and `pans` must have at least 3 elements (since `i` is 1 at the start of the current iteration, and the loop can execute if `i` is less than `len(pans)`).

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is `n`
- `pans` must have at least 3 elements

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented to `n + 1`
- `pans` must have at least 4 elements (since the loop will check if `i` is less than `len(pans)`)

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `_` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input `s` was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input `s` was '<', and `pans` must have at least 4 elements, `mak` is 0 or `n` depending on the input, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` for which the input `s` was '<', the output buffer has been flushed. If the input is '>', `mak` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**
