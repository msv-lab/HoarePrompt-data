Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string and must have at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`, `rev_res` remains an empty string.**

Explanation: The code `rev_val.append(x[::-1])` appends the reversed string of `x` to the list `rev_val`. Since the initial state specifies that `rev_val` is an empty list, after the code execution, `rev_val` contains the reversed string of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged, and `rev_res` remains an empty string as specified in the initial state.
