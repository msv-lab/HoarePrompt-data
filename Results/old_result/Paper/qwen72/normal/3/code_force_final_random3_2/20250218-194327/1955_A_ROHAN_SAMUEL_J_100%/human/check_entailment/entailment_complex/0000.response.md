### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.

2. **Odd and Even Cases**:
   - If `n` is odd:
     - The function checks if the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n` because buying each yogurt individually is cheaper.
     - If `2 * a >= b`, it prints `n // 2 * b + a` because buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and then buying the remaining single yogurt individually is cheaper.
   - If `n` is even:
     - The function checks if the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n` because buying each yogurt individually is cheaper.
     - If `2 * a >= b`, it prints `n // 2 * b` because buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price is cheaper.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 or 2.
   - For `n = 1`, the function will print `a` because it's the only option.
   - For `n = 2`, the function will print `b` if `b` is cheaper than `2 * a`, otherwise it will print `2 * a`.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the test case `2 5 9`:
     - `n` is even, `2 * a = 10` is greater than `b = 9`, so the function prints `9`.
   - For the test case `3 5 9`:
     - `n` is odd, `2 * a = 10` is greater than `b = 9`, so the function prints `1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
   - For the test case `3 5 11`:
     - `n` is odd, `2 * a = 10` is less than `b = 11`, so the function prints `3 * 5 = 15`.
   - For the test case `4 5 11`:
     - `n` is even, `2 * a = 10` is less than `b = 11`, so the function prints `4 * 5 = 20`.

5. **General Correctness**:
   - The logic of the function is sound and correctly implements the conditions described in the problem statement.
   - The function ensures that the minimum cost is calculated for both odd and even values of `n`.

### Correctness:
**True**
