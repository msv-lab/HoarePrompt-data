Output State: **`l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f` and `l` must be less than `h`, `h` is the index of the largest element in `D` that is less than `right - f`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right` remain unchanged, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.
- The values of `l` and `h` remain unchanged.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`) remain unchanged.
