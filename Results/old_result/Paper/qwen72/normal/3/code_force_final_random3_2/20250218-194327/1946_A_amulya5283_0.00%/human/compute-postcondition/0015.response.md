The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value of `smallest + 1` into the `heap`. 

- `smallest` is the element at `arr[median_index + 1]`.
- `heap` is a min-heap containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index + 2` to the end.
- After pushing `smallest + 1` into `heap`, the heap will be updated to include this new value, and it will maintain its min-heap property.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `operations`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[i]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a min-heap containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index + 2` to the end, plus the value `smallest + 1`, `operations` is 1, `smallest` is the element at `arr[median_index + 1]`.**
