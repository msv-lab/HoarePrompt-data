Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the game logic correctly as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not simulate the turns of the players or the conditions under which Sasha wins. Instead, it attempts to concatenate and reverse the numbers in a way that does not follow the rules of the game.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2
14 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Sasha
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output "Anna" because it does not correctly simulate the game. According to the problem, Anna can reverse the number 2 to 2, and then Sasha can concatenate 2 and 14 to get 214, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). Therefore, Sasha wins. However, the program does not follow this logic and instead concatenates the numbers in a way that does not reflect the game rules.
