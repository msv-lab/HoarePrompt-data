Output State: **`i` is 0, `N` is greater than or equal to 0, `nums[0]` is not equal to `num`, `arr` contains a new tuple `(1 + 0, 0, num)` at the end, `s` is 0.**

The value of `s` is now 0, which is the same as the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged: `i` is still 0, `N` is still greater than or equal to 0, `nums[0]` is still not equal to `num`, and `arr` still contains the new tuple `(1, 0, num)` at the end.
