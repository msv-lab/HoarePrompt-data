Output State: **`p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx`, `p2` is an empty list if `p1[-1] != v2` or `p2` is a list containing `v1` if `p1[-1] == v2`, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` must contain at least one tuple, `v1` and `v2` are the values of the last tuple in `ops`**

Explanation:
- If `p1[-1] == v2`, then `p2.append(v1)` is executed, so `p2` now contains `v1`.
- If `p1[-1] != v2`, then `p1.append(v1)` is executed, so `p1` now contains all integers from the set `vx` plus `v1`.
- The values of `vx` and `ops` remain unchanged.
- The values of `v1` and `v2` remain the values of the last tuple in `ops`.
