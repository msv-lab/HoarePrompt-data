Output State: **`i` is `x`, `z` is `x + 1`**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = x` (inclusive), so after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `x`.
- In each iteration, `z` is updated by the expression `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`. Since `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1` but not equal to `k - 1`, the term `z // (k - 1)` will be 0 for the first few iterations until `z` becomes large enough. However, the `+ 1` part will always add 1 to `z` in each iteration.
- Therefore, after `x + 1` iterations, `z` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration, resulting in `z` being `x + 1` at the end of the loop.
