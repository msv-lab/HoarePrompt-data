### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD of the difficulties of these sub-problems.
   - The GCD of a set of numbers is maximized when the numbers are as evenly distributed as possible.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `n` from the input.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum GCD found.
   - It iterates over all integers `i` from 1 to the integer square root of `x` (inclusive).
   - For each `i`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i`.
   - If `x` is divisible by `i`, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `i`.
   - If either condition is true, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i` or `x // i`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The loop from 1 to `isqrt(x)` ensures that we only check divisors up to the square root of `x`, which is efficient.
   - The conditions `n <= x // i` and `n <= i` ensure that we can divide `x` into `n` sub-problems with each sub-problem having a difficulty that is a multiple of `i`.
   - The GCD of the sub-problems will be `i` if `n <= x // i` or `x // i` if `n <= i`.
   - The function correctly updates `ans` to the maximum GCD found.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `n == 1`, the only sub-problem will have difficulty `x`, and the GCD will be `x`.
   - When `n == x`, each sub-problem will have difficulty 1, and the GCD will be 1.
   - The function handles these cases correctly by checking the conditions and updating `ans`.

5. **Output Verification:**
   - For the test case `10 3`, the function correctly finds that the maximum GCD is 2 (sub-problems can be 4, 2, 4).
   - For the test case `5 5`, the function correctly finds that the maximum GCD is 1 (sub-problems can be 1, 1, 1, 1, 1).
   - For the test case `420 69`, the function correctly finds that the maximum GCD is 6 (sub-problems can be 6, 6, 6, ..., 6).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance (GCD) of the problemset for the given constraints and test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
