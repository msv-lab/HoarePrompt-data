Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array `a`, and the array `a` itself, which contains `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n). The total number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in a:
        cntl[i] += 1
    if cntl[0] == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        c = min(2, cntl[0])
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if cntl[j] < 2:
                c -= 1
                if not c or j == n:
                    print(j)
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`. If the first element of `cntl` is 0, the program retains all variables as they are. If the first element of `cntl` is not 0, `j` is the smallest index in the range 1 to `n` where `cntl[j]` is less than 2, or `n` if no such index exists, and `c` is 0 if `j` is less than `n` and `cntl[j]` is less than 2, otherwise `c` is the minimum of 2 and the first element of `cntl`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of how many times the corresponding index appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the program retains all initial conditions. If `cntl[0]` is not 0, `j` is set to `n`, and if the loop has not broken early, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus the number of times `cntl[j]` was less than 2 for `j` from 1 to `n`. If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, the program has broken out of the loop, and the value of `j` where this occurred is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` (for each `i` in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0. If `cntl[0]` is 0, it indicates that the integer 0 does not appear in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is not 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is set to `n`, and if `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, the loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `c` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
