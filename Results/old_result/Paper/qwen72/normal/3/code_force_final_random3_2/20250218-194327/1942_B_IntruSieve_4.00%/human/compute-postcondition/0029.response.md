Output State: **`minn` is 1, 2, or 3; `maxx` is 0 or updated to the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn`; `func_1` is not properly defined; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `arr` is a list of integers input by the user; `mex` is a list containing either `[0, 0, 1]`, `[0, 0, 2]`, or `[0, 0, 3]` or the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` and `0` and `minn`; `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- `minn` is incremented by 1, so if it was 0, it becomes 1; if it was 1, it becomes 2; if it was 2, it becomes 3.
- `maxx` is either 0 or updated to the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus the new value of `minn`.
- `mex` is a list containing either `[0, 0, minn]` or the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` and `0` and `minn`. Since `minn` is now 1, 2, or 3, `mex` will be `[0, 0, 1]`, `[0, 0, 2]`, or `[0, 0, 3]` or the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus the new `minn` and `0` and the new `minn`.
- The values of `func_1`, `n`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged.
