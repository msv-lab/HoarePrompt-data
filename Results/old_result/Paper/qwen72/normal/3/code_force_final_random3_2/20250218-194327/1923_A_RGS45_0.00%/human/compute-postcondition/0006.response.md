Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive).**

Explanation:
- `z` is assigned the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive).
- If `x` is -1, `z` will be an empty string because the start index is out of bounds.
- If `y` is -1, `z` will be the substring from index `x` to the end of `arr` because `n - (-1) - 1` is `n`.
- If both `x` and `y` are valid indices, `z` will be the substring from `x` to `n - y - 1`.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.
