Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed when the `print` statement executes.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 6 characters.
- `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 5.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `j` is 3.
- `count2` retains its original value.
- `done` retains its original value if `s[j]` equals `s[n - 1 - j]`.
- If `s[j]` does not equal `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to `True`.
- Additionally, if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is updated to 3.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides information about various variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement itself.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will execute independently of the initial state and will always print the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The code will print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
