Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is `j`, `count2` is 0. The character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x`, and `count` is less than 1. If the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains False.**
