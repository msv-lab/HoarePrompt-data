Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `i` is 1.
3. `n` is the input integer.
4. `w` is a list of integers input by the user.
5. `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `w[j]` (for `j` in range `n`) is incremented by 1.
6. `j` is `n`.
7. `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from 0 to `n`) where `q[j]` is greater than 0.
8. `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, and `eta_ln` is 1.
9. `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`.

### Analysis:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `w` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `w[j]` (for `j` in range `n`) is incremented by 1. This means that for each integer in `w`, the corresponding index in `q` is incremented by 1.
- `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from 0 to `n`) where `q[j]` is greater than 0. Given that `eta_ln` is 1, there is exactly one index in `q` that is greater than 0.
- `rho` is the value of `q` at the index `eta[0]`, which is the only index in `q` that is greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
```

### Explanation:
- The code snippet calculates the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), which is the number of ways to choose 3 elements from a set of `n` elements.
- The formula is \( \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2)}{6} \).
- The `//` operator performs integer division, ensuring the result is an integer.

### Final Output:
The code prints the result of the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), which is the number of ways to choose 3 elements from a set of `n` elements.

Output: **\(\frac{n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2)}{6}\) (where \( n \) is the input integer)**
