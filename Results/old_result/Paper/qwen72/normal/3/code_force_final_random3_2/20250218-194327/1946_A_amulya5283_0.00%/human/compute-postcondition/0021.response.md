Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[i]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a min-heap containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end, but all elements in the heap are greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- **`i`**: Remains 0, as the loop does not modify this variable.
- **`results`**: Remains an empty list, as the loop does not modify this variable.
- **`n`**: Remains the first element of `test_cases[i]`, as the loop does not modify this variable.
- **`arr`**: Remains the second element of `test_cases[i]` and is still sorted in ascending order, as the loop does not modify this variable.
- **`median_index`**: Remains `n // 2`, as the loop does not modify this variable.
- **`current_median`**: Remains `arr[median_index]`, as the loop does not modify this variable.
- **`heap`**: Initially, the heap contains the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end. After all iterations of the loop, the heap still contains these elements, but each element has been incremented by 1 enough times so that the smallest element in the heap is now greater than `current_median`.
- **`operations`**: This variable holds the total number of times the loop executed, which is the number of times the smallest element in the heap was less than or equal to `current_median` and was incremented by 1.
