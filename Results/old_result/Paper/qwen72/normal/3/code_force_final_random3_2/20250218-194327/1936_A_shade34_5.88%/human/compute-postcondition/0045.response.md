Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 1 if `s` is '<', otherwise `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the input was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such input was provided, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing `[1]` if `s` is not '<' or '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]` if `s` is either '<' or '=', and `s` is the input string.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call does not change the values of any variables. It only ensures that any buffered output is written to the terminal or output stream immediately. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
