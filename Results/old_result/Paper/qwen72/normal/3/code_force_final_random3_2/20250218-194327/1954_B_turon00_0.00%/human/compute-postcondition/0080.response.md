Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a new list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `i` is 1, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `_` is incremented by 1, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`.***
