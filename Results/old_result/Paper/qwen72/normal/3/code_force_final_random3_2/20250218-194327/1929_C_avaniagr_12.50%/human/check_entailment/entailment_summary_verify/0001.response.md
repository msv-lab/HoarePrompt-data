### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the original assessment and the function logic step by step.

#### Case 1: \( x < k - 1 \)
- **Original Assessment**: The condition \( a \geq x + 1 \) ensures that Sasha has enough coins to place a bet of 1 coin after \( x \) losses.
- **Correctness**: This is correct. If Sasha loses \( x \) times, he will have \( a - x \) coins left. Since \( x < k - 1 \), he can always place a bet of 1 coin and win \( k \) coins, resulting in \( a - x + k \) coins, which is always greater than \( a \). Therefore, he can continue this strategy to increase his coins indefinitely.

#### Case 2: \( x = k - 1 \)
- **Original Assessment**: The condition \( a \geq x + 3 \) ensures that Sasha has enough coins to cover the worst-case scenario of losing \( k - 1 \) times and then winning once.
- **Correctness**: This is incorrect. The correct condition should be \( a \geq x + 1 \). After \( k - 1 \) losses, he will have \( a - (k - 1) \) coins left. He needs at least 1 more coin to place a bet of 1 coin and win \( k \) coins, resulting in \( a - (k - 1) + k = a + 1 \) coins. Therefore, he needs \( a \geq k - 1 + 1 = x + 1 \) coins to continue.

#### Case 3: \( x > k - 1 \)
- **Original Assessment**: The loop calculates the total number of coins \( z \) needed to guarantee a win after \( x \) losses.
- **Correctness**: The loop logic is indeed incorrect. The loop should calculate the total number of coins needed to cover the worst-case scenario of losing \( x \) times in a row and then winning once. The correct calculation should be \( z = (x + 1) \cdot (k - 1) \). If \( a \geq z \), Sasha can achieve the objective; otherwise, he cannot.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = (x + 1) * (k - 1)
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has logical errors in both the condition for \( x = k - 1 \) and the loop for \( x > k - 1 \). The corrected conditions and calculations are necessary to ensure the program's correctness.

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
