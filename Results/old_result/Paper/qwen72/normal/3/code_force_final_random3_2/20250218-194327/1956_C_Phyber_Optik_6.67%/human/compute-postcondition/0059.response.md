To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

### Given State:
- `j` is `n + 1` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n`, and `n + r` otherwise.
- `t` is unchanged.
- `_` is reset to a value less than `t`.
- `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n`, and `2 * n + 2 * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= 2 * n`.
- `r` is 2 if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n`, and 1 if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n` and 0 otherwise.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
- The loop will execute again if `i` (which is now 3) is less than `n + 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is 3.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again (since `i` is 3 and `i` must be less than `n + 1`).

### Final State:
State: **`j` is `n + 1` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n`, and `n + r` otherwise. `t` is unchanged, `_` is reset to a value less than `t`. `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n`, and `2 * n + 2 * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= 2 * n`. `r` is 2 if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n`, and 1 if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n` and 0 otherwise. `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
