Output: **-1**

Explanation:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet simply prints the integer `-1`. The initial state describes the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, `i`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the `-1` literal value provided in the `print` statement.
