The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters. Given the constraints and the typical structure of such functions, it is likely that the function processes the list `a` for each test case and returns a specific value or list of values based on the properties of `a`.

Since the exact output is not provided, we can only describe the parameters and the general expected behavior.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (the number of test cases), `n` (the length of the list `a`), and `a` (a list of integers of length `n`). It processes the list `a` for each test case and returns a result based on the properties of `a`.**
