Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is the new input string, `arr` is [1, 2] if `res` is '<' or '=', otherwise `arr` is [1].**

The value of `i` (which is 2) is appended to the list `arr`. If `res` is '<' or '=', `arr` was initially [1], and now it becomes [1, 2]. If `res` is neither '<' nor '=', `arr` remains [1] after appending `i`. The values of `n` and `res` remain unchanged.
