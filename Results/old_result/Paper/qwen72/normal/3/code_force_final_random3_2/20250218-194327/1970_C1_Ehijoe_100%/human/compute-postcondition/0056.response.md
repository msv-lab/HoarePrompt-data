Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list with all keys processed, `empty` remains `True`, `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one connected node, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing all nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they were traversed, `prev` is the node immediately before `e` in the traversal, and `curr` is equal to `e`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`, `i`, `nodes`, `empty`, `ends`, `s`, `e`:** These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`tree`:** The list `tree` initially contains the first element of `ends` (`s`). As the loop iterates, it appends each `curr` node to `tree` until `curr` equals `e`. Therefore, after the loop completes, `tree` contains all nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they were traversed.
- **`prev`:** `prev` is updated to the node immediately before `e` in the traversal. This is because `prev` is set to the current `curr` at the end of each iteration, and the loop stops when `curr` becomes `e`.
- **`curr`:** `curr` is updated in each iteration to the next node in the traversal. The loop continues until `curr` equals `e`, at which point the loop terminates. Therefore, after the loop completes, `curr` is equal to `e`.
