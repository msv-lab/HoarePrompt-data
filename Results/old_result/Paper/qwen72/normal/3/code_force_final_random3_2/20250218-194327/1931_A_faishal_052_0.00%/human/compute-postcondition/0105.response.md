The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the range `2`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `2`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 1, and it must still be less than `2`.

State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains `[1]`. If `lex` is between 27 and 51, `arr` contains `[26]` and `lex` is an integer between 1 and 25. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains `[26]` and `lex` is an integer greater than or equal to 26.**
