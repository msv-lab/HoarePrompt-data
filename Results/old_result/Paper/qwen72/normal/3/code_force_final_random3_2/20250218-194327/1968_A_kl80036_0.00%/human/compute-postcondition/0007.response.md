Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `x` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\).
   - `y` is calculated as `x // 2`, which means `y` is the integer division of `x` by 2.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `t` must be greater than 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(y)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The value of `y` is determined by the formula `x // 2`.
   - Since `x` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `y` will be an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
   - The `print(y)` statement will output the value of `y`.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be the integer value of `y`, which is `x // 2`.

Output: **y (where y is the integer division of x by 2, and x is an integer between 2 and 1000)**
