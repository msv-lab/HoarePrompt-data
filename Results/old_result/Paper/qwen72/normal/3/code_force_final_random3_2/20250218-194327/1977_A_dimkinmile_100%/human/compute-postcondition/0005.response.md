Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are specific integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, and `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. If the difference between `n` and `m` is a non-negative even number, then the difference between `n` and `m` is a non-negative even number. Otherwise, either (n - m) is not divisible by 2, or n - m is less than 0.***
