Reasoning:

The program aims to construct a permutation `p` from the given array `a` based on the problem's conditions. However, there are several issues in the provided program that need to be addressed:

1. **Function Definition and Call**: The function `func_1` is called without any parameters, but it should take parameters to handle multiple test cases. The function should be defined to accept the number of test cases and the test cases themselves.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The outer loop `for _ in range(int(input())):` is correctly set up to handle multiple test cases, but the function `func_1` is not designed to process multiple test cases. It should be modified to handle each test case individually.

3. **Permutation Construction**: The logic inside `func_1` is incorrect. The MEX (Minimum EXcluded value) is not being calculated correctly, and the permutation `p` is not being constructed based on the correct MEX values.

4. **Output**: The function prints the `mex` list, which is not the permutation `p` that the problem requires. The output should be the permutation `p` that satisfies the given `a`.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should:

- Initialize an empty permutation `p`.
- Track the MEX value for the current prefix of `p`.
- Use the values in `a` to determine the correct elements to add to `p`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = []
    mex = 0
    seen = set()
    
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            p.append(mex)
            seen.add(mex)
            mex = next(j for j in range(n) if j not in seen)
        else:
            p.append(mex - arr[i])
            seen.add(mex - arr[i])
    
    print(' '.join(map(str, p)))

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

Explanation of the corrected program:
- **Initialization**: `p` is initialized as an empty list to store the permutation. `mex` is initialized to 0, and `seen` is a set to keep track of the elements that have been added to `p`.
- **Loop**: For each element in `arr`:
  - If `arr[i]` is non-negative, the current MEX value is added to `p`, and the MEX value is updated to the next smallest integer not in `seen`.
  - If `arr[i]` is negative, the value `mex - arr[i]` is added to `p`, and this value is also added to `seen`.
- **Output**: The permutation `p` is printed as a space-separated list of integers.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the original program is:

Correctness: **False**
