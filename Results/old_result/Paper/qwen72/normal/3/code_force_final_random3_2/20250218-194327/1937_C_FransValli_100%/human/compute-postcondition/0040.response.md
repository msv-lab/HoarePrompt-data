Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, and `res` is the new input string. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is [2]. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is [1, 2]. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged.** 

The value of `res` is updated to the new input string, but the conditions for `arr` remain the same based on the value of `res`. The values of `n` and `i` are unchanged.
