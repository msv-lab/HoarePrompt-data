Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is less than `c`. If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` is true. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c` and it is not the case that `a < b > c`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations:
- The variable `t` remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- The loop index `i` has reached the value `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- For each iteration, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` were input as integers, and the loop checked the conditions:
  - If `a < b < c`, it printed 'STAIRS'.
  - If `a < b > c`, it printed 'PEAK'.
  - If neither condition was true, it printed 'NONE'.
