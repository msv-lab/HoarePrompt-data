### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Single Character String:**
   - If the string `s` has a length of 1, it is a palindrome by definition. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.

3. **Checking if the First and Last Characters are Different:**
   - If the first and last characters of the string `s` are different, the entire string is not a palindrome. The program correctly prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition.

4. **Checking if All Characters are the Same:**
   - If all characters in the string `s` are the same, the string is a palindrome and any substring of it will also be a palindrome. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.

5. **Checking if All but One Character are the Same:**
   - If all but one character in the string `s` are the same, the program checks if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If the string length is odd and the middle character is different, the program correctly prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition. This is correct because the string itself is not a palindrome if the middle character is the same as the others.

6. **General Case:**
   - For strings where the first and last characters are the same, the program attempts to find a partition where at least one substring is not a palindrome.
   - It iterates through the string to find the first pair of characters that are different.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition.
   - If no such pair is found, it attempts to find a valid partition by splitting the string into two parts where the first part ends at the first different character and the second part starts at the next character.
   - The logic for finding the partition is complex but aims to ensure that the resulting substrings are not palindromes.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as strings of length 1 and strings where all characters are the same.
   - It also handles cases where the string is a palindrome with one different character in the middle.

8. **Output Format:**
   - The program correctly prints "YES" or "NO" followed by the number of parts and the partition itself when applicable.

### Correctness:
The program is mostly correct, but there are a few issues in the logic for finding the partition in the general case. Specifically, the logic for splitting the string into two parts is overly complex and may not always produce the correct partition. However, the overall structure and handling of edge cases are correct.

### Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly handle some cases where the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. For example, the string "abba" should be partitioned into "a" and "bba" or "ab" and "ba", but the program may not produce the correct partition in such cases. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.
