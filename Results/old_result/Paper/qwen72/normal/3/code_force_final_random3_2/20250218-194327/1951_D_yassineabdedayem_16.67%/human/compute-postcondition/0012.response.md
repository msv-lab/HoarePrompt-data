Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be a positive integer, `k` must be a positive integer, `rep` is 0, `number` is `Max`, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is equal to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is equal to `max(int(n / k), k)`, and either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.**

The value of `number` is now set to the value of `Max`, which is `max(int(n / k), k)`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
