Output State: **`j` is `n + r`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is reset to a value less than `t`, `sum` is 0, `r` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the condition `(n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n)` is true.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
