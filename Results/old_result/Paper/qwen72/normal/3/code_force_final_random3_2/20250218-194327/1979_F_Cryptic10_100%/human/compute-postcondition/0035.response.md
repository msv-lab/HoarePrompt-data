Output State: **`p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx`, `p2` is a list containing `v1` if `p1[-1] == v2` or `p2` remains an empty list if `p1[-1] != v2`, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` must contain at least two tuples, `v1` and `v2` are the values of the second-to-last tuple in `ops`. If `p1[-1] == v2`, then `p2` now contains `v1`. If `p1[-1] != v2`, then `p1` now contains an additional element `v1`.**
