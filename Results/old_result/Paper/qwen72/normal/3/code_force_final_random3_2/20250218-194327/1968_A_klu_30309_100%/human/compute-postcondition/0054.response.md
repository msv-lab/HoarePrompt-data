Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list (and must be at least 2), `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` appended to it, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found during the loop iterations, `best_y` is the value of `y` that produced the maximum `current_sum`, `y` is 1.**
