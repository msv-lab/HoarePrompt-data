Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `nx` is the character at index 0 of the string at index 3 in `xx`, `j` is 1, and the character at index 0 of the string at index 3 in `xx` is not '?'**

Explanation:
- `nx` is updated by appending the character at index `i` (which is 3) in the string `xx` at index `j - 1` (which is 0).
- The character at index 0 of the string at index 3 in `xx` is not '?', so `nx` now contains this character.
- The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The condition that the character at index 0 of the string at index 3 in `xx` is not '?' remains valid.
