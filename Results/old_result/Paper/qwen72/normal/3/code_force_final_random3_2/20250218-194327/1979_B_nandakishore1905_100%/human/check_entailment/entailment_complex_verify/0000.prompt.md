You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

    #State: `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `i` is the number of iterations specified by the user input, `n` and `m` are the last input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the number of bits in this binary representation, and `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\). If `k` is even and not a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the number of bits in this binary representation, and `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\). If `k` is odd, no changes are made to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a number of iterations from the user, then for each iteration, it reads two distinct non-negative integers `n` and `m` from the user. It calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`. If `k` is odd, it prints `1`. If `k` is even but not a power of 2, it prints the largest power of 2 that can be obtained by subtracting powers of 2 from `k` until the result is a power of 2. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the program state includes the number of iterations specified by the user, the last input integers `n` and `m`, and the final value of `k` which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program provided has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the length of the longest common subsegment. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the cases where the difference between `n` and `m` (denoted as `k`) is a power of 2 or has a specific binary pattern that affects the length of the longest common subsegment.

### Case Analysis:
1. **Power of 2 Case:**
   - If `k` is a power of 2, the program correctly prints `k`. This is because a power of 2 has only one bit set in its binary representation, and the longest common subsegment in this case is indeed `k`.

2. **Odd Number Case:**
   - If `k` is odd, the program prints `1`. This is incorrect because the longest common subsegment for an odd `k` is not necessarily `1`. For example, if `x = 5` and `y = 7`, the difference `k = 2` (which is not odd), but the longest common subsegment is `1` because the sequences do not align in a way that allows a longer common subsegment.

3. **General Case:**
   - The program attempts to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` and then subtracts it from `k` until `f & f - 1 == 0`. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly account for the binary patterns that determine the length of the longest common subsegment.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
- Consider the input `x = 12` and `y = 4`. The difference `k = 8`, which is a power of 2. The program correctly prints `8` in this case.
- However, consider the input `x = 5` and `y = 7`. The difference `k = 2`, which is not a power of 2 and is not odd. The program will incorrectly print `1` because it does not handle this case correctly. The correct output should be `1` because the sequences do not align to form a longer common subsegment.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach to solve this problem involves understanding the binary representation of the difference `k` and how it affects the sequences. The length of the longest common subsegment is determined by the position of the least significant bit that is set in `k`. This can be calculated using the formula `2 ** (k & -k).bit_length() - 1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly when the difference `k` is not a power of 2 and is not odd. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
