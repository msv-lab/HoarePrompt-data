Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 2, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the subsequent `n` elements are the `n` input strings. If `b[2]` is greater than 0 and `a[2]` is equal to 0, `sa` is a list containing `[2]` and `sb` is a list containing the values `[1, 2]`. Otherwise, `sa` and `sb` retain their initial states as described in the precondition, with `sb` now containing the value `2` appended to it.**
