The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and a sorted list of integers `p` (where each element is between 1 and 100). It modifies `n` by repeatedly subtracting the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` until `n` becomes less than the smallest integer in `p`. The function returns the modified `n`, which is a non-negative integer that is less than the smallest integer in the list `p`. The list `p` remains unchanged.
