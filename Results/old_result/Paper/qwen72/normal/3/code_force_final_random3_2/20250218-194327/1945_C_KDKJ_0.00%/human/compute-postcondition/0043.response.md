Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `left` is the first element of the list `S[i]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + S[i][1])`, `ans` is 0 if the conditions are met, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
