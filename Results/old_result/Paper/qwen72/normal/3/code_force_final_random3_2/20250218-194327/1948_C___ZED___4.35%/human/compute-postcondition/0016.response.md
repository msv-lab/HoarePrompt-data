Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with the second-to-last character being '>', `k` is 2, `no_path` is False.**

The variable `no_path` is explicitly set to `False` in the code snippet. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and conditions. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `no_path` and retains all other initial conditions.
