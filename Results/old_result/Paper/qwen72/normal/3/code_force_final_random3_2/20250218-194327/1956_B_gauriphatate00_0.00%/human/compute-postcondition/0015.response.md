Output State: **`input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `3 + n`, `t` is now `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[idx]` to `data[idx + n - 1]`**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))` updates the list `a` to contain `n` integers starting from the index `idx` in the `data` list.
- The initial state specifies that `idx` is `3 + n`, and `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`.
- Therefore, `a` is now a list of `n` integers starting from `data[3 + n]` to `data[3 + 2n - 1]`.
- All other variables and conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.
