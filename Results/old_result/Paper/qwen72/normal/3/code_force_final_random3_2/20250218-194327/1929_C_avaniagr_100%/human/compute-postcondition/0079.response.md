Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case is defined by three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` (with constraints 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9). For each test case, it determines whether a certain condition is met and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. Specifically, if `x < k - 1`, it prints 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, otherwise 'NO'. If `x == k - 1`, it prints 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, otherwise 'NO'. If `x > k - 1`, it calculates a value `z` using a nested loop and prints 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, otherwise 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. **
