Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is 0.
- `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
- The first two elements of `arr` are either 1 or 26.
- The third element of `arr` is `lex`, where:
  - `lex` is between 0 and 25 if it was between 26 and 51 initially.
  - `lex` is between 26 and 74 if it was between 52 and 100 initially.
  - `lex` is `lex - 2` if it was less than or equal to 26 initially.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `k`**:
   - `k` is 1, so we are accessing the second element of the list `arr`.

2. **Value of `arr[k]`**:
   - Since `k` is 1, `arr[k]` is the second element of `arr`.
   - According to the initial state, the first two elements of `arr` are either 1 or 26.
   - Therefore, `arr[1]` can be either 1 or 26.

3. **Value of `chr(arr[k] + 96)`**:
   - The `chr` function converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character.
   - If `arr[1]` is 1, then `arr[1] + 96` is 97, and `chr(97)` is 'a'.
   - If `arr[1]` is 26, then `arr[1] + 96` is 122, and `chr(122)` is 'z'.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will print the character corresponding to `arr[1] + 96`.
   - Since `arr[1]` is either 1 or 26, the output will be either 'a' or 'z'.

### Final Output:
Output: **a or z (where 'a' is printed if the second element of `arr` is 1, and 'z' is printed if the second element of `arr` is 26)**
