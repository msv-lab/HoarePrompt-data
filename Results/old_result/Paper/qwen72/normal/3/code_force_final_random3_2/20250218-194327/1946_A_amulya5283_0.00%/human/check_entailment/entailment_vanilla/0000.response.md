### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read`, which is efficient for large inputs. It then splits the input into a list of strings and processes each test case by extracting the array length `n` and the array `arr` from the list.
   - The use of `index` to keep track of the position in the input list is appropriate and ensures that the program correctly processes each test case.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - For each test case, the array `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is necessary to find the median, which is the element at the middle index of the sorted array.

3. **Median Calculation**:
   - The median index is calculated as `n // 2`. This is correct for both even and odd lengths of the array. For an odd length, `n // 2` gives the middle index. For an even length, it gives the first of the two middle indices, which is the correct median in this context.

4. **Heap Initialization**:
   - A min-heap is initialized with the elements from the median index to the end of the array. This is because we need to increase the median, and the elements from the median index onwards are the ones that can potentially become the new median.

5. **Operations to Increase Median**:
   - The program uses a while loop to continuously increase the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median. Each time the smallest element is increased, the number of operations is incremented.
   - This approach ensures that the minimum number of operations is used to increase the median, as it always targets the smallest element that is still less than or equal to the current median.

6. **Output**:
   - The results for each test case are stored in a list and printed one by one.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The use of a min-heap ensures that the smallest possible elements are increased first, which is the optimal strategy to achieve the goal with the fewest operations.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
