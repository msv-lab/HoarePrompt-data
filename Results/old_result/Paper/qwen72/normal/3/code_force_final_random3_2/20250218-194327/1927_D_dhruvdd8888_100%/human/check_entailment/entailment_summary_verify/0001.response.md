### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`tc`).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It appends `-1` to the array `nums` to handle edge cases. This is a valid approach to ensure the loop runs one extra iteration to capture the last group of consecutive elements.
   - It initializes variables `s` (start index), `e` (end index), and `num` (current number).
   - It iterates through the array to group consecutive equal elements into a list `arr` of tuples, where each tuple contains the start index, end index, and the number of the group. This grouping is done correctly.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it reads the query boundaries `l` and `r`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the start index of the group is just greater than or equal to `l`. This is a correct approach to find the relevant group.
   - It retrieves the start and end indices of the group at `eli` or the last group if `eli` is out of bounds.
   - The conditions to check if a valid pair exists within the query range are:
     - If the start index of the group is greater than `l` and the start index is not 1 and not greater than `r`, it prints the indices `s-1` and `s`. This condition is intended to check if there is a valid pair just before the start of the group.
     - If the end index of the group is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `-1 -1`. This condition is intended to check if the group extends beyond the query range, and no valid pair exists.
     - If the end index of the group is less than `N` or less than `l`, it prints the indices `s` and `e+1`. This condition is intended to check if there is a valid pair just after the end of the group.
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1 -1`.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program correctly groups consecutive equal elements in the array.
   - The use of `bisect_left` is appropriate to find the start of the group that might contain the query range.
   - However, the conditions to check if a valid pair exists within the query range are not entirely correct:
     - The condition `if s > l and (s != 1 or s > r)` is problematic. The `s != 1` part is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. For example, if `l = 1` and the first element of the array is different from the second element, this condition will incorrectly print `-1 -1`.
     - The condition `elif e >= r` is correct in the sense that if the end index of the group is greater than or equal to `r`, no valid pair exists within the query range.
     - The condition `elif e < N or e < l` is also problematic. The `e < l` part is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. For example, if `l = 3` and the group ends before `l`, this condition will incorrectly print `s` and `e+1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the query range is entirely within a single group of equal elements correctly. It should print `-1 -1` if all elements in the range are the same.
   - The program does not handle the case where the query range spans multiple groups correctly. It should find the first valid pair within the range.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses `bisect_left` to efficiently find the start of the group, which is `O(log N)` per query.
   - The overall complexity is `O(N + Q log N)`, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program has logical errors in the conditions used to determine if a valid pair exists within the query range. These errors can lead to incorrect outputs for certain query ranges. Therefore, the program is not correct as per the problem description.

Final: **False**
