Output State: **`pathb` must have at least two elements, `i` is incremented by 1, if `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `curr` is updated to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`.
- The precondition that `pathb` must have at least two elements remains valid.
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and this change is reflected in the output state.
- The condition that if `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement remains valid.
