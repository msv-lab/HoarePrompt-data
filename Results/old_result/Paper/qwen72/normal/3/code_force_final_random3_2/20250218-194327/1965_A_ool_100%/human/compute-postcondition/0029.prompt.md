You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of arr is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive.
def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    if (set_[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns the string 'Alice'.
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive; `A` is False; `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr`, and the first element of `set_` is 1.
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive; `A` is the negation of the initial value of `A` if all differences between consecutive elements in `set_` are 1, otherwise `A` is the value it was last set to before the loop broke; `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr`, and the first element of `set_` is 1; `not_c` is False if any difference between consecutive elements in `set_` is greater than 1, otherwise `not_c` remains True; `i` is the index where the loop broke or `len(set_) - 1` if the loop completed all iterations.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: *`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive; `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr`, and the first element of `set_` is 1; if any difference between consecutive elements in `set_` is greater than 1, `not_c` is False and the program executes the if part, setting `A` to the negation of its initial value and `i` to the index where the loop broke or `len(set_) - 1` if the loop completed all iterations. Otherwise, `not_c` remains True and `A` retains the value it was last set to before the loop broke.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, or 'Bob' if `A` is False. `A` is the negation of its initial value if any difference between consecutive elements in `set_` is greater than 1, and retains its last set value otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns 'Alice' if the difference between any consecutive elements in `arr` is greater than 1, or if no such difference exists and the initial value of `A` is True. Otherwise, it returns 'Bob'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string 'Alice'.

Case_2: The program returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, or 'Bob' if `A` is False. `A` is the negation of its initial value if any difference between consecutive elements in `set_` is greater than 1, and retains its last set value otherwise.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
