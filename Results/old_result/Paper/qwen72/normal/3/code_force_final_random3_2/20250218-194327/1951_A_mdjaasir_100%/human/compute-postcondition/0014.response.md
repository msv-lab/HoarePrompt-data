Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, and `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`. Additionally, `count` is not equal to 0, `count` is less than or equal to 2, and `count` is exactly 2. The character immediately following the first '1' in `a` is also '1'.**
