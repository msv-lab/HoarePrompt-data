Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', `arr` is `[0]`, `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr = [0]` reassigns the variable `arr` to a new list containing only the integer `0`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `maxi`, `mini`, and `item`) are not affected by this code, so their values remain as they were in the initial state. The value of `item` is now the last element of the updated `arr`, which is `0`.
