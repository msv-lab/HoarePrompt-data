Output State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `resb`, `pathb`, `paths`, and `vis` remain unchanged; `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, and `vis[pb - 1]` is equal to 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `resb`, `pathb`, `paths`, and `vis` remain unchanged. The variable `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, and `vis[pb - 1]` is set to 1. The `break` statement causes us to exit the most internal loop or if statement we are currently in.
