Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 4.
   - `a` is an input string.
   - `b` is an input string with the second-to-last character being '>'.
   - `k` is 3.
   - If the character at index `k` in `a` is not '>', `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(k)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `k` is explicitly defined as 3 in the initial state.
   - The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`.

Since `k` is explicitly given as 3, the output of the `print(k)` statement will be:

Output: **3**
