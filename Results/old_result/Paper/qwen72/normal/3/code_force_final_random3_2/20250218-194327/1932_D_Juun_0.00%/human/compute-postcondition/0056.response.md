Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `user_input` is the user's input as a string, `trump` is the user's input as a string, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value must be set to a non-`None` value. If `trumps` is not an empty list and `rank` is not `None`, an additional string in the format 'rank suit trumps.pop() trump' has been appended to `answers`. If `trumps` is an empty list, the program returns `None`.***
