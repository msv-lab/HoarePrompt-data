Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the strip is already entirely white. According to the problem description, if the strip is already all white, the minimum length of the segment to be painted white is 0. However, the program will always return a value greater than 0, even if the strip is already all white.

Example input that fails:
```
1
3
WWW
```

Expected output:
```
0
```

Actual output:
```
2
```

The program incorrectly returns 2 instead of 0. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
