### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array by performing a specific operation no more than 500,000 times.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

2. **Function 1: `func_1`**:
   - This function is intended to compute the maximum possible sum of the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index]` using dynamic programming.
   - It uses a dictionary `res_dict` to memoize results to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `start_index == end_index`, where the function returns the maximum of 1 and the single element in the subarray.
   - For subarrays with more than one element, it recursively computes the maximum sum by considering different splits of the subarray and the MEX value of the subarray.
   - However, the function does not correctly compute the MEX value. It seems to be using a heuristic that is not aligned with the MEX definition.

3. **Function 2: `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to construct the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the maximum value and then tries to backtrack to find the operations that lead to this value.
   - The function has a logical error in the condition where it checks if the maximum value is equal to `length ** 2`. This condition is not aligned with the MEX operation and the problem's requirements.

4. **Function 3: `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is intended to transform a subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - The function checks if the subarray is already a staircase and returns if it is.
   - If the subarray is not a staircase, it recursively transforms the subarray.
   - The function updates the subarray and appends the operation to the result list `res`.
   - However, the function does not correctly handle the MEX transformation and the updates to the array are not aligned with the problem's requirements.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the MEX value.
   - The backtracking logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not correctly reconstruct the sequence of operations.
   - The `make_stairs` function does not correctly transform the subarray into the desired MEX values.
   - The program does not meet the problem's requirements for maximizing the sum and constructing the sequence of operations.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program contains logical errors in the computation of the MEX value and the construction of the sequence of operations, leading to incorrect results.
