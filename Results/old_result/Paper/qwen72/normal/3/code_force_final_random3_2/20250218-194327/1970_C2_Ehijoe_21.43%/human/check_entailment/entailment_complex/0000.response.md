### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem involves a game played on a tree where each round starts with a stone on a specific node.
   - Players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses the round.
   - The game is played optimally, and we need to determine the winner for each round.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function computes the distances from the starting node to all its descendants.
   - If the starting node is a leaf (i.e., it has only one neighbor which is its parent), it returns a list containing the integer 0.
   - Otherwise, it recursively computes the distances for each child node and adds 1 to each of these distances.
   - The function returns a list of these distances.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and identifies the starting node for the round.
   - It then calls `func_1` to get the list of distances from the starting node to its descendants.
   - The function checks if any of these distances is odd. If so, Ron wins the round; otherwise, Hermione wins.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Tree Construction**: The tree is constructed correctly using a `defaultdict` of lists. Each edge is added to both nodes, ensuring the tree is undirected.
   - **Leaf Node Identification**: The function correctly identifies leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one connection).
   - **Distance Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the distances from the starting node to its descendants. If the starting node is a leaf, it returns `[0]`. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the distances and adds 1 to each.
   - **Winning Condition**: The function `func_2` correctly determines the winner based on the distances. If any distance is odd, Ron wins because he can always make the first move and force Hermione into a position where she has no valid move. If all distances are even, Hermione wins because she can always mirror Ron's moves, ensuring she is the last to make a move.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the starting node is a leaf by returning `[0]`, which is correct.
   - The function also handles the case where the starting node has multiple children and correctly computes the distances.

6. **Optimal Play**:
   - The game is played optimally, and the logic in `func_2` correctly reflects the optimal strategy. If there is any odd distance, Ron can always win by moving to a node with an odd distance, leaving Hermione with an even number of moves. If all distances are even, Hermione can always mirror Ron's moves, ensuring she wins.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
