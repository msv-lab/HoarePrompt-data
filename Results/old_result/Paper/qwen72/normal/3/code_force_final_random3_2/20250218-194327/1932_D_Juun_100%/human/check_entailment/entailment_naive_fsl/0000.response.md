Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are multiple non-trump cards of the same suit and the second player cannot beat the first player's card with a higher rank card. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
3
S
3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S
```

The program will output:
```
3C 4C
6D 9S
3S 7S
```

However, this output is incorrect because the second player cannot beat the first player's 6D with 9S, as 9S is a trump card and 6D is not. The correct output should be:

```
3C 4C
6D 7S
3S 9S
```

This shows that the program does not correctly handle the logic for ensuring that a non-trump card can only be beaten by a trump card if there are no higher-ranked cards of the same suit available.
