Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, followed by the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Problem Difficulties**: The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`. This is a good approach to keep track of how many problems of each difficulty level are available.

3. **Calculating Missing Problems**: The program iterates over the keys in the `defaultdict` and checks if the count of each difficulty level is less than or equal to `m`. If it is, it calculates the number of additional problems needed for that difficulty level by adding `m - d[val]` to the answer `ans`. This is the correct logic to determine the minimum number of problems needed for each difficulty level.

4. **Output**: The program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

5. **Default Value Function**: The function `func_1` is defined to return 0, but it is not used in the program. This is a minor issue, but it does not affect the correctness of the program.

However, there is a critical issue in the program:

- **Default Value for `defaultdict`**: The `defaultdict` is initialized with `default_value`, which is not defined. This will cause a `NameError` when the program runs. The correct way to initialize a `defaultdict` with a default value of 0 is to use `defaultdict(int)`.

Given this issue, the program will not run correctly as is. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
