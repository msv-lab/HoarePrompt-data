n, m, and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m, k <= 2 * 10^5. A is a list of n integers in strictly increasing order (1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9, a_i < a_{i+1}). D is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models (1 <= d_i <= 10^9). F is a list of k integers representing the complexities of the functions (1 <= f_i <= 10^9).
