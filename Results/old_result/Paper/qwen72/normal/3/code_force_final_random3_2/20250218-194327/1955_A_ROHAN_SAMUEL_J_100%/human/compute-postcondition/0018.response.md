To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers input by the user.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- The conditions for `n` and the relationship between `2 * a` and `b` are as follows:
  - If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is less than `b`, the condition `2 * a < b` holds.
  - If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the condition `2 * a >= b` holds.
  - If `n` is even and `2 * a` is less than `b`, the condition `2 * a < b` holds.
  - If `n` is even and `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the condition `2 * a >= b` holds.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n // 2 * b + a)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `n // 2`**:
   - `n // 2` performs integer division of `n` by 2.
   - If `n` is even, `n // 2` will be `n / 2`.
   - If `n` is odd, `n // 2` will be `(n - 1) / 2`.

2. **Calculate `n // 2 * b`**:
   - This is the product of the integer division result and `b`.
   - If `n` is even, `n // 2 * b` will be `(n / 2) * b`.
   - If `n` is odd, `n // 2 * b` will be `((n - 1) / 2) * b`.

3. **Add `a` to the result**:
   - The final expression is `n // 2 * b + a`.

### Output Based on Conditions:
- **If `n` is even**:
  - `n // 2` is `n / 2`.
  - The expression becomes `(n / 2) * b + a`.
  - The output will be the value of `(n / 2) * b + a`.

- **If `n` is odd**:
  - `n // 2` is `(n - 1) / 2`.
  - The expression becomes `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a`.
  - The output will be the value of `((n - 1) / 2) * b + a`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of the expression `n // 2 * b + a`, which depends on whether `n` is even or odd.

Output: **n // 2 * b + a (where n is the user input integer greater than 0, a and b are user input integers, and n // 2 is the integer division of n by 2)**
