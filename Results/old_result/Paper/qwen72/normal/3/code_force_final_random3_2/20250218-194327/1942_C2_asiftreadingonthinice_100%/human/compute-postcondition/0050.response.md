Postcondition: ***`tmp` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is increased by the value of `i`, and `y` is decreased by the value of `i - 1`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
