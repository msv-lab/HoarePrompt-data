Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop, `i` is `n - 4`, `j` is `n - 1`. If the integer `j + 1` appears exactly once in the list `cards`, then `dp[n - 4][n - 1]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` and `dp[n - 2][n - 2] + 1`. If the integer `j + 1` appears more than once in the list `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.**
