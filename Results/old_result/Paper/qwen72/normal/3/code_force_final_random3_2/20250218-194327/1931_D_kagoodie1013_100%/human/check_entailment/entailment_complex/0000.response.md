Reasoning:  
The program reads the input and processes it to form a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`. The function `func_1` then processes each test case to find the number of beautiful pairs as defined in the problem statement.

The logic for finding beautiful pairs is based on the residues of the elements in the array when divided by `x` and `y`. Specifically, for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful, the following conditions must hold:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The function uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the number of times each pair of residues \((r_x, r_y)\) has been encountered, where:
- \(r_x = -a_i \mod x\)
- \(r_y = a_i \mod y\)

For each element `num` in the array `arr`, it calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y` and checks if the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) has been seen before in `residue_map`. If it has, it adds the count of that pair to the total `count` of beautiful pairs. Then, it updates `residue_map` with the current pair of residues.

This approach is correct because:
- \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \mod x\) can be rewritten as \(a_i \equiv -a_j \mod x\), which is why we use \(-a_i \mod x\) to find the complement.
- \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \mod y\) can be rewritten as \(a_i \equiv a_j \mod y\), which is why we use \(a_i \mod y\).

The program correctly handles the input and output format, and the logic for counting beautiful pairs is sound.

Correctness: **True**
