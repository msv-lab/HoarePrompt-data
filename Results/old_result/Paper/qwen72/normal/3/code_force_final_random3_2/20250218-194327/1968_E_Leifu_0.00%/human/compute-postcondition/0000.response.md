Output State: **`n` is the size of the grid (n x n), `t` is an input integer.** 

The function accepts an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) as input, and `n` is the size of the grid (n x n). The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `t`, where `input()` accepts an integer input from the user, and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still the size of the grid.
