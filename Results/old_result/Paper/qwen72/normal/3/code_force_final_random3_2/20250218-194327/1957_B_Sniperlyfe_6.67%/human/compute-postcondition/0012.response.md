Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` of `n` elements where each element is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, except the last element, which is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1 + k`.** 

In natural language, this means the program returns a list `nums` with `n` elements. Each element in the list, except the last one, is the value of `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. The last element in the list is the value of `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1 + k`.
