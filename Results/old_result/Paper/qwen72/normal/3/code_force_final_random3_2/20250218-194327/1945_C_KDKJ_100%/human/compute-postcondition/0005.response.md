Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, and `func_1()` has been called.** 

The code snippet `func_1()` simply calls the function `func_1()`, but since the function's implementation is not provided, we cannot determine any specific changes to the variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
