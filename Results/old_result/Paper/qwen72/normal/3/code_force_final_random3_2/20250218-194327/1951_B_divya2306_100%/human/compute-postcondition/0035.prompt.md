Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is the last index of the iteration (i.e., `n-1` if the loop completes without breaking), `wins` is the number of iterations where `a[i]` was not greater than `a[k - 1]`, `wins` is less than `k`, `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
    if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
        break
    win_with_swap += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `wins` is less than `k`, `win_with_swap` is `wins + 2` and is less than `k - 1`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the loop continues with `i` being adjusted within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `wins` is less than `k`, `win_with_swap` is `wins + 3` and is less than `k - 1`, `i` is `win_with_swap + 1`. If `a[i] > a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `wins` is less than `k`, `win_with_swap` is `wins + 4` and is less than `k - 1`, `i` is `win_with_swap + 2`. If `a[i]` > `a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the same values for `wins`, `win_with_swap`, and `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
