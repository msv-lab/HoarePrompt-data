Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list (and must be at least 2), `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is the value of `y` that produced the greatest `max_sum`, and `y` is 0 (or 1 if `x` was 2).**
