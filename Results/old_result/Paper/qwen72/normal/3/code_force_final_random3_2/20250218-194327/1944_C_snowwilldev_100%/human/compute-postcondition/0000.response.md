Output State: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`. The list `a` contains integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `N` is an input integer.**
