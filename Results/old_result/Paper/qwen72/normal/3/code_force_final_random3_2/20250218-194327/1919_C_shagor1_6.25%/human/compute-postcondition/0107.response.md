Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it identifies the smallest and second smallest elements in `a` (if they exist) and counts how many elements in `a` are greater than both of these elements. The function prints the count for each test case and does not return any value. The state after the function concludes is that the smallest element in `a` is stored in `x`, the second smallest element (if it exists) is stored in `y`, and `ans` contains the count of elements greater than both `x` and `y`. The value of `n` remains unchanged for each test case. **
