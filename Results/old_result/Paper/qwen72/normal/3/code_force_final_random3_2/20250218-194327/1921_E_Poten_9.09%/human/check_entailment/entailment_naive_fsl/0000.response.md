Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the winner when the chips are moving towards each other in the same column (i.e., `y_a == y_b`) is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that if both `x_a` and `x_b` are on the same parity (both even or both odd), then Bob wins. However, this is not always true. 

For example, consider the following test case:
```
h = 5, w = 5, x_a = 2, y_a = 3, x_b = 4, y_b = 3
```
In this case, Alice starts at (2, 3) and Bob starts at (4, 3). Both `x_a` and `x_b` are on different parities (2 is even, 4 is even), and they are in the same column. Alice can move down to (3, 3) on her first turn, and then Bob can move up to (3, 3) on his turn, resulting in Bob winning. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Draw" for this case.
