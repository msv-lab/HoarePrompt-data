Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input from standard input and splits it into lines.
   - It correctly parses the number of test cases `t` from the first line.
   - For each test case, it parses `n`, `x`, and `y` from the next line and the array `arr` from the following line.
   - It appends the parsed values as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.
   - The state of the program after this function call is correct, with `test_cases` containing the expected tuples.

2. **Processing in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case in the `test_cases` list.
   - It initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, it calculates `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx` is calculated as `(-a % x + x) % x`, which ensures that `rx` is always non-negative and represents the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`.
     - `ry` is calculated as `a % y`, which is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the `freq` dictionary and increments the count if it is.
   - It then updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - The function appends the count of beautiful pairs to the `results` list.
   - The state of the program after this function call is correct, with `results` containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

3. **Output in `func_2`**:
   - After processing all test cases with `func_1`, `func_2` prints each result to the standard output.
   - The state of the program after this function call is correct, with all results printed as expected.

4. **Logical Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies beautiful pairs by checking the conditions:
     - `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` if and only if `a_i % x + a_j % x == 0` or `a_i % x == -a_j % x`.
     - `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` if and only if `a_i % y == a_j % y`.
   - The use of `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that the remainder is non-negative, which is necessary for the dictionary keys.
   - The function correctly counts the pairs that satisfy both conditions.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when `x` or `y` are 1, or when the array `arr` contains duplicate elements.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where no beautiful pairs exist.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be logically correct and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
