Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k` after being updated to `n - Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 1, `Min` is equal to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is equal to `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `tab` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `number`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - Max` and `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - Min` and `number` is `Max`.***
