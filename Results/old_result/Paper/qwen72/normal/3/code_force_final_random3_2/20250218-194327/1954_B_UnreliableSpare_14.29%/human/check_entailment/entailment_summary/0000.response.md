Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. However, the logic implemented in the program does not correctly address the problem requirements.

1. **Checking if all elements are the same**:
   - The program correctly checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.

2. **Finding the minimum number of consecutive occurrences**:
   - The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in the array. This approach is flawed because:
     - It only considers the first element and its consecutive occurrences, which may not be the correct way to determine the minimum number of elements to remove.
     - The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove such that the array can no longer be made beautiful by the given operations, not just the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the following:
     - If all elements are the same, the array is always beautiful, and the answer is `-1`.
     - If the array has different elements, we need to find the minimum number of elements to remove such that no index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) exists where `a[i-1] = a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced with `a[i-1]`.

4. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has different elements. It only checks the first element and its consecutive occurrences, which is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **False**
