Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` (for each `i` in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0. If `cntl[0]` is 0, it indicates that the integer 0 does not appear in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is not 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is set to `n`, and if `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, the loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `c` remains unchanged.***
