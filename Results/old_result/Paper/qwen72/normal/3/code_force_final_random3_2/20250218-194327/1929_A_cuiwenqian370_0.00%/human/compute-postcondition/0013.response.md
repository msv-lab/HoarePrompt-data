To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `left` and `right`.

According to the code, the loop condition is `left <= right`. For the loop to execute one more time, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.
- `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n.
- `left` is 1.
- `right` is `n - 2`.

Given these conditions, the loop can execute one more time if `left` is less than or equal to `right`. Since `left` is 1 and `right` is `n - 2`, the loop will execute one more time as long as `1 <= n - 2`, which simplifies to `n >= 3`.

Since `n` is already given to be within the range 2 <= n <= 100, and `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again, no adjustment is needed to `left` or `right` to ensure the loop can proceed.

Therefore, the state remains the same:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 1, `right` is `n - 2`. If `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` contains the first element of `arr`. Otherwise, `new_arr` contains the last element of `arr` and the first element of `arr`.**
