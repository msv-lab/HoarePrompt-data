Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 1; `ans` is an empty string, `x` is 0.** 

The code snippet initializes `x` to 0, which was previously undefined. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `ans`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial states.
