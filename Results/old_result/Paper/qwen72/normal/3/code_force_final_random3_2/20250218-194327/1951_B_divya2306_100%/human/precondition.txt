The function `win` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function signature. Based on the problem description, the function should take a list of integers `a` representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and two integers `n` and `k` representing the number of cows and the index of the cow owned by the user, respectively. The ratings `a` are distinct, and the indices `n` and `k` are within the valid range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n). Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, each defined by the values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.
