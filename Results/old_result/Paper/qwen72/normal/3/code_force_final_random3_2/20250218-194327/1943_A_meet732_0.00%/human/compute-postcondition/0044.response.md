Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0 except `cntl[i]` which is 2, `i` is the second element in the list `a`.** 

The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
