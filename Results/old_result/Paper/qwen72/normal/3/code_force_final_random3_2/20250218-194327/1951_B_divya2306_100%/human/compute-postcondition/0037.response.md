The function `max_wins` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `ratings`. `n` is an integer representing the number of cows, `k` is an integer representing the index of your cow (1-indexed), and `ratings` is a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The function returns the number of iterations where the rating of a cow was not greater than the rating of your cow (located at index `k - 1`), and this count is greater than or equal to `k`.
