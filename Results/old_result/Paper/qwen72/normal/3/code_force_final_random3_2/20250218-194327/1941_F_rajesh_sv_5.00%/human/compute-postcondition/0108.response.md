Postcondition: ***`l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f` and `l` must be less than `h`, `h` is the index of the largest element in `D` that is less than `right - f`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right` remain unchanged. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`. In both cases, `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is updated to `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is updated to `D[mid + 1] + f`.***
