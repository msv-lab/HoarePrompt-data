Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is 0 or a non-zero integer.
- `k` is 0.
- `rep` is 60 or less.
- `tab` is a list containing at least 1 string representation of a number.
- `i` is the first element of `tab`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(i, end=' ')
```

This statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space, without moving to a new line.

Since `i` is the first element of `tab`, and `tab` is a list containing at least one string representation of a number, the value of `i` will be the string representation of the first number in `tab`.

Output: **[i] (where [i] is the string representation of the first number in the list `tab`)**
