Output State: **`ans` is increased by the value of `y`, `y` remains unchanged, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged, `ii` is `tt - 1`, `tt` must be greater than `ii`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. The other variables (`ans`, `y`, `n`, `x`, `ii`, `tt`, and `chosen_vertices`) remain unchanged.
