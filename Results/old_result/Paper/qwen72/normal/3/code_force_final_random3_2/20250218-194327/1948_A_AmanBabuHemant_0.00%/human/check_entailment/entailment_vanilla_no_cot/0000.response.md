Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. **Output Format**: The problem requires the output to be a string of uppercase Latin letters, but the program outputs a string of '1's and '0's, which does not meet the requirement.

2. **Special Character Definition**: The problem defines a special character as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program constructs a string like "110110110..." which does not necessarily meet this definition. For example, in "110110110", the '0's are not special because they are not equal to any of their neighbors.

3. **String Length**: The program constructs a string of length `3 * (n // 2)`, which is always a multiple of 3. This is not necessary and may not always be the shortest possible string that meets the criteria.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you should:
- Construct a string where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- Ensure the string is of uppercase Latin letters.
- Ensure the string length is at most 200.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Special Character Construction**: The string "AAB" is used to ensure that each 'A' is a special character (equal to exactly one of its neighbors). The pattern "AAB" is repeated `n // 2` times to get exactly `n` special characters.
- **Output Format**: The string is composed of uppercase Latin letters.
- **String Length**: The length of the string is `3 * (n // 2)`, which is always less than or equal to 200 for `n <= 50`.

This corrected program will produce the correct output for the given problem.
