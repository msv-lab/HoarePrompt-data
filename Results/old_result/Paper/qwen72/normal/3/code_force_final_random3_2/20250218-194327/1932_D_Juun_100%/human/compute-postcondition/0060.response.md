To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `suits` is a dictionary where each key (suit) is either `None` or the rank of the last card of that suit encountered that did not form a pair with a previously seen card of the same suit.
2. `trumps` is a sorted list in descending order, containing at least one element.
3. `answers` is a list containing strings in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` for each suit in `suits` that has a non-`None` rank, where `{suit}` is the suit and `{popped_trump}` is the corresponding rank from the `trumps` list. If `trumps` was not long enough to match all non-`None` ranks in `suits`, the loop will have printed 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returned early.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`trumps.pop()`**: This method removes and returns the last element of the list `trumps`. Since `trumps` is sorted in descending order, the first `trumps.pop()` will return the largest element in the list.
2. **`{trump}`**: This is a placeholder in the formatted string. The value of `trump` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is likely a string representing the suit (e.g., 'H' for hearts, 'D' for diamonds, etc.).
3. **Second `trumps.pop()`**: This method will again remove and return the last element of the list `trumps`, which is now the second largest element in the list.

### Output Determination:
- The first `trumps.pop()` will return the largest element in the `trumps` list.
- The second `trumps.pop()` will return the second largest element in the `trumps` list.
- The `trump` variable is a suit, which is a string.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output a string in the format:
```
{largest_trump}{trump} {second_largest_trump}{trump}
```
where `{largest_trump}` is the largest element in the `trumps` list, `{second_largest_trump}` is the second largest element in the `trumps` list, and `{trump}` is the suit string.

### Example:
- If `trumps` is `[10, 9, 8]` and `trump` is `'H'` (hearts), the output will be:
  ```
  10H 9H
  ```

### Final Answer:
Output: **{largest_trump}{trump} {second_largest_trump}{trump} (where {largest_trump} is the largest element in the `trumps` list, {second_largest_trump} is the second largest element in the `trumps` list, and {trump} is the suit string)**
