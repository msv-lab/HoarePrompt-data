Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `string` is the new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and is greater than 5, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 1, and `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `count` is greater than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `count` is 1 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was less than 1, otherwise `count` remains greater than 0, `count2` is 0, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
