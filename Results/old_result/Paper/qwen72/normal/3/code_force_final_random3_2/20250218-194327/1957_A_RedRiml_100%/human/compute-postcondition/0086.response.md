The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `palka`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `palka`. If `palka` has at least one integer, the loop will execute. The state of `i` will be the first integer in `palka` at the start of the loop.

State: **`palka` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in `palka`, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is incremented by 1, `w` is greater than the new value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `pl` is an empty list, and `d` is an empty dictionary.**
