The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `N` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1 to 2, and for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 2**
