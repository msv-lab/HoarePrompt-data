Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is 2, `c` is increased by 1, `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `l` remains the same, `r` remains the same.**

The code snippet updates the value of `res[c]` to `ans % m % MOD`. The value of `c` is increased by 1, and `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`. The values of `n`, `k`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than 2, `k` is 2, `c` is increased by 1, and `l` and `r` remain the same. The specific values of `ans`, `m`, `MOD`, and `arr[l]` are not provided, so the updated values of `res[c]` and `ans` are expressed in terms of these variables.
