The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is -1 if the loop executed fully or 0 if the loop was broken, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is now `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is now `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is the value of `a[b] + a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `i` is 1. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
