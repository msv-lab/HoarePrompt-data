The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `a`. For the loop to execute, the list `a` must not be empty. Given that `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= n <= 100, the loop will execute if `a` contains at least one integer. The variable `x` will take the value of the first element in `a` at the start of the first iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `a` has at least one element and `x` is the first element in `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100 and `n` must be at least 1, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `x` is the first element in `a`**
