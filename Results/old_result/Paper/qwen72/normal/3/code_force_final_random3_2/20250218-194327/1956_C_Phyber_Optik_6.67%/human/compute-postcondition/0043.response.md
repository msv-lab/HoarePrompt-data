Output State: **`j` is `n + r`, and the condition `j <= n + r` no longer holds true for the loop to execute again. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `sum`, and `r` remain unchanged.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = n + r`.
- After the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will be equal to `n + r`.
- The loop condition `j <= n + r` will no longer be true, so the loop will terminate.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `sum`, and `r` are not modified within the loop, so they remain the same as they were in the initial state.
