Output State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, and `resb` remain unchanged; `paths` is a list that now includes the elements `a[ps - 1]`, `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on, appended to its end until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1; `ps` is now the value of the last index in the sequence `p[ps - 1]`, `p[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on, that was visited (i.e., `vis[ps - 1]` is 1).**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, and `resb` remain the same as they were in the initial state. The list `paths` will contain the elements from the list `a` corresponding to the indices in the sequence `ps - 1`, `p[ps - 1] - 1`, `p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1`, and so on, until the loop encounters an index that has already been visited (i.e., `vis[ps - 1]` is 1). The variable `ps` will be the last index in this sequence that was visited, meaning the loop will stop appending to `paths` and updating `ps` once it reaches an index that has already been marked as visited in the `vis` list.
