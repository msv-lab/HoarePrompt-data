Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list with all keys processed, `empty` remains `True`, and `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one connected node.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `n` is still greater than or equal to 2.
- The variable `i` is still `n-2`.
- The `nodes` dictionary has been fully processed by the loop, meaning all keys in `nodes` have been checked.
- The variable `empty` remains `True` because it is not modified within the loop.
- The `ends` list now contains all the keys from `nodes` that have exactly one connected node (i.e., their list of connected nodes has a length of 1). If no such keys exist, `ends` remains an empty list.
