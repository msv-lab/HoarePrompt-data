The only objects in the loop head are `factor` and `rest`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `rest`. If `rest` is a non-empty iterable, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)`. For the loop to execute, `rest` must contain at least one element.

State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the first element in `rest`**
