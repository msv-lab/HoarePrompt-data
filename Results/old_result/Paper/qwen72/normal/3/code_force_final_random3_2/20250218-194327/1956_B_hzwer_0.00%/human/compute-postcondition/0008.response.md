Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0, and `dp[n - 2][0]` which is now 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 1`, `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`, and the integer `j + 1` is not present in the list `cards`.** 

The value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
