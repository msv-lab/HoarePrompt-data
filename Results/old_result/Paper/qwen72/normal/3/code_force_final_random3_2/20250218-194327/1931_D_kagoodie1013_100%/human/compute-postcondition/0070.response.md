Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is the first element of the last tuple processed, `x` is the second element of the last tuple processed, `y` is the third element of the last tuple processed, `arr` is the fourth element of the last tuple processed and has `len(arr)` elements, `results` is a list containing the final `count` value for each tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is the total number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` that have been encountered more than once for the last tuple processed, `residue_map` contains keys that are tuples of the form `(num % x, num % y)` for each `num` in the last `arr`, and the value for each key is the number of times that pair has been encountered, `num` is the last element of the last `arr` processed, `r_x` is `-num % x` for the last element, `r_y` is `num % y` for the last element, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values of `num % x` and `num % y` for the last element.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `test_cases` list remains unchanged. The `results` list now contains the final `count` value for each tuple in `test_cases`, where `count` represents the total number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` that have been encountered more than once during the processing of each tuple's `arr`. The `residue_map` dictionary is populated with keys that are tuples of the form `(num % x, num % y)` for each `num` in the last `arr` processed, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that pair has been encountered. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are set to the values from the last tuple processed in `test_cases`. The variables `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key` are set to the values corresponding to the last element of the last `arr` processed.
