The code snippet provided contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes that `t` must be greater than 0 and `n` is an input integer that is odd. However, these conditions do not affect the `print` statement in any way, as the statement is simply printing a static string.

Output: **NO**
