Postcondition: ***`t` is the previous value of `t` minus 2 and still greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be at least `mdx + 2`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, `res` is 0. If the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`, then `res` is 1. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.***
