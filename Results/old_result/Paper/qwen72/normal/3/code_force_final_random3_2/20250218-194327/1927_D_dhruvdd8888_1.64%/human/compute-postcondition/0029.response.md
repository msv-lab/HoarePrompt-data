The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop executes, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`N` is the integer value read from `sys.stdin.readline`, `nums` is a list of integers with `-1` appended, `s` is `N`, `e` is 0, `num` is `-1`, `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(start, end, value)` represents the start and end indices of a contiguous segment of `nums` that had the same value, and the value itself, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`. If `ppp` is 23, the variables retain their values as described in the precondition. The loop will execute if the result of `int(input())` is greater than 0.**

To simplify, the adjusted state focusing only on the loop head is:
State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
