To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration:

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 1
- `k` is an even integer provided by the input
- `_` is 2
- `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive
- `i` is 1
- `answer` is a list containing the integers [1, `array`[-1]] if `i` is odd, otherwise `answer` is a list containing the integers [1, 1]
- `a` is [1, -2] if `i` is odd, otherwise `a` is [2, -1]

Loop head:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The loop head specifies that `i` should be in the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive).
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
4. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Since the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`, and the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`, we need to update `i` to 2 and ensure that `n` is greater than 2.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 2, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 2, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2, `answer` is a list containing the integers [1, 1], `a` is [2, -1]**
