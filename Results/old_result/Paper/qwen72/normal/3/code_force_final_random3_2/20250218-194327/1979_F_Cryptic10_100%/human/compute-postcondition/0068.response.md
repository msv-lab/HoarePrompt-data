Output State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive. `ops` is a list containing tuples based on the value of `v2` for each iteration. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)` for each such iteration. If `v2` â‰¤ 0, `ops` contains the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` for each such iteration. `p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx` plus any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`. `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`. `int(input())` must be greater than 1.**

### Explanation:
- **`vx`**: The loop continues to remove elements from `vx` until `len(vx) <= 2`. Therefore, after all iterations, `vx` will contain exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive.
- **`ops`**: The list `ops` accumulates tuples based on the value of `v2` for each iteration. If `v2` is greater than 0, the tuple `(v1, v2)` is appended to `ops`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are appended to `ops`.
- **`p1` and `p2`**: These lists are updated based on the conditions specified in the loop. `p1` contains all integers from the set `vx` plus any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`. `p2` contains any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`.
- **`int(input())`**: This value must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

The loop will terminate when `vx` has exactly 2 elements left, and the final state of `ops`, `p1`, and `p2` will reflect the operations performed during each iteration of the loop.
