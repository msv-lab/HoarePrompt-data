Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n + r`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 1, and the current value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.**

Explanation:
- `r` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
