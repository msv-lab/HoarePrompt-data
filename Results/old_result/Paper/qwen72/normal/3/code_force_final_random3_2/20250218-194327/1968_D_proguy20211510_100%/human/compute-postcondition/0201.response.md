Given the `while True:` loop, it is designed to always execute at least once, regardless of the initial state of the program. Since the condition of the loop is `True`, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the first iteration to proceed.

State: **`n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps` are integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb` remain unchanged, `pathb` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of `n` integers where `vis[pb - 1]` is 1 and the rest are 0**
