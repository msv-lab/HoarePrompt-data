You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used. The function reads from standard input and processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n, two integers x and y, and an array arr of n integers.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    t = int(data[0])
    test_cases = []
    idx = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))
        
        test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
        
        idx += 2
        
    #State: `data` is a list of strings, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, each tuple is `(n, x, y, arr)`, where `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers derived from the corresponding parts of the strings at `data[1], data[3], ...`, and `arr` is a list of integers derived from the strings at `data[2], data[4], ...`. `idx` is `2 * t + 1`.
    results = func_1(test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `results` must be an iterable with at least `t` elements, and the loop will have printed all `t` elements of `results`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and an array `arr` of `n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
