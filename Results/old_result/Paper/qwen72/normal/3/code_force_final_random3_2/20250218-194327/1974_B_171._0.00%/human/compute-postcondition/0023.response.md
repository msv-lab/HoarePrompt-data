Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `decoded` is a list containing either the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the character 'a' if `char` is not in `mapping`. If `char` is not in `mapping`, `c` is 97 and `mapping` is updated to include the key 'a' mapped to `char`. `char` is the next character in `encoded`. The `decoded` list now includes the value of `mapping[char]` appended to it.**

In natural language: The `decoded` list has been updated to include the value of `mapping[char]` appended to it. The `encoded` string remains unchanged, and if `char` was not in `mapping`, `mapping` has been updated to include the key 'a' mapped to `char`, and `c` is still 97. The `char` is still the next character in `encoded`.
