Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2. If `count2 == count` and `count > 1`, `count` and `count2` remain unchanged, and `done` is set to True, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2 == count` and `count <= 1`, `count2` is set to 0, `count` remains unchanged, and `done` remains unchanged. If `count2 > count`, `done` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2, `done` remains unchanged, and `count2` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` remains unchanged, `count` remains unchanged, and `count2` is increased by 1. If `count` is greater than 0, `done` is True. If `count` is less than 1 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is set to 1 and `done` is True. If `count` is less than 1 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count` remains unchanged, `count2` is increased by 1, and `done` remains unchanged.***
