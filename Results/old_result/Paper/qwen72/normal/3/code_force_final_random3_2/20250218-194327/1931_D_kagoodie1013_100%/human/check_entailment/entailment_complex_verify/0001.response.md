Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then iterates over this list to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case, including `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`. This approach is efficient and correctly handles the input format.

2. **Test Case Storage**: The program stores the test cases in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. This is a good way to organize the data for processing.

3. **Residue Calculation**: For each test case, the program initializes a `count` variable to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs. It also initializes a `residue_map` dictionary to store the counts of pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)` where `r_x` is the residue of `-num` modulo `x` and `r_y` is the residue of `num` modulo `y`.

4. **Pair Counting**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `arr`, it calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y`.
   - It then checks if the current pair of residues `(r_x, r_y)` already exists in the `residue_map`. If it does, it adds the count of this pair to `count`.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current pair of residues `(num % x, num % y)`.

5. **Output**: The program collects the results for all test cases and prints them, each on a new line.

6. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating the residues is correct. The pair `(r_x, r_y)` is used to determine if a pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is beautiful.
   - However, there is a subtle issue in the way the residues are calculated and used. The program uses `-num % x` for `r_x` and `num % y` for `r_y`. While `num % y` is correct, `-num % x` can lead to incorrect results because the modulo operation in Python can return a negative value. To ensure the residue is always non-negative, we should use `(-num) % x` instead of `-num % x`.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 2, which is the minimum allowed value.
   - It also handles the case where the array elements are all the same, as the residues will be the same, and the program will correctly count the pairs.

8. **Efficiency**:
   - The program processes each test case in \(O(n)\) time, which is efficient given the constraints.

Given the above reasoning, there is a potential issue with the residue calculation for `r_x`. The correct way to calculate `r_x` should be `(-num) % x` to ensure it is always non-negative. This change is necessary to correctly identify beautiful pairs.

Final: **False** 

The program is incorrect due to the potential issue with the residue calculation for `r_x`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        residue_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            r_x = (-num) % x  # Corrected residue calculation
            r_y = num % y
            count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
            current_key = (num % x, num % y)
            residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

With this correction, the program should work as expected and produce the correct output for the given problem description.
