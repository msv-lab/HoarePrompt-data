Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of finding a pair of indices `(i, j)` within a given range `[l, r]` such that `a_i â‰  a_j`. However, the program's logic and implementation do not correctly address the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined but called as `func_1()` inside a loop. This is correct.
   - The function reads input using `sys.stdin.readline`, which is efficient for large inputs.

2. **Array Processing**:
   - The program processes the array `nums` by grouping consecutive identical elements and storing the start and end indices of these groups in `arr`.
   - The logic for grouping is flawed. The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has multiple distinct elements within a query range.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the starting index of the first group that starts at or after `l`.
   - The program then checks various conditions to determine if a valid pair `(i, j)` exists:
     - If the start of the group is greater than `l`, it checks if the start is within the range `[l, r]` and prints the indices.
     - If the end of the group is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `(-1, -1)`.
     - If the end of the group is less than `r`, it prints the indices `(s, e + 1)`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `(-1, -1)`.

However, the program's logic is incorrect for several reasons:
- **Incorrect Grouping**: The program groups consecutive identical elements but does not correctly handle the case where the range `[l, r]` spans multiple groups with different elements.
- **Query Logic**: The program's conditions for determining the existence of a valid pair `(i, j)` are not comprehensive enough. It fails to check if there are any different elements within the range `[l, r]`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. **Preprocess the Array**: Use a data structure to store the first and last occurrence of each element within the array.
2. **Query Handling**: For each query `(l, r)`, check if there are any two different elements within the range `[l, r]`:
   - If there are, output the indices of any two different elements.
   - If there are no different elements, output `(-1, -1)`.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    first_occurrence = defaultdict(int)
    last_occurrence = defaultdict(int)
    
    for i in range(N):
        if nums[i] not in first_occurrence:
            first_occurrence[nums[i]] = i + 1
        last_occurrence[nums[i]] = i + 1
    
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = map(int, input().split())
        found = False
        for i in range(l - 1, r):
            if first_occurrence[nums[i]] < l or last_occurrence[nums[i]] > r:
                continue
            for j in range(i + 1, r):
                if nums[i] != nums[j]:
                    print(i + 1, j + 1)
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break
        if not found:
            print(-1, -1)

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to handle multiple groups of different elements within the query range and does not correctly determine the existence of a valid pair `(i, j)`.

Correctness: **False**
