Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - `arr` is a list containing integers, and it must have at least `n` elements.
   - `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.
   - `item` is the last element of `arr`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Variable Values:**
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - The print statement will output the values of `maxi` and `i` twice each, along with the string `'?'`.

4. **Explanation:**
   - The string `'?'` is printed as is.
   - The value of `maxi` is 0, so it will be printed twice.
   - The value of `i` is 1, so it will be printed twice.
   - The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately flushed to the console, but it does not affect the content of the print statement.

Given this information, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
