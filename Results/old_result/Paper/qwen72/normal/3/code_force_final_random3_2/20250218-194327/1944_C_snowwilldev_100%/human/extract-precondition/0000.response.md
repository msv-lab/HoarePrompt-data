Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`. The list `a` contains integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def func_1(a, n):
```

To properly handle multiple test cases, the function might need to be called in a loop or the function definition might need to be adjusted to handle the test cases internally. Here is a more accurate function definition:

```python
def game_score(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n` and the list `a`. For example:

```python
test_cases = [(4, [0, 0, 1, 1]), (4, [0, 1, 2, 3]), (2, [1, 1])]
game_score(3, test_cases)
```

This would be the correct way to define the function to match the problem description.
