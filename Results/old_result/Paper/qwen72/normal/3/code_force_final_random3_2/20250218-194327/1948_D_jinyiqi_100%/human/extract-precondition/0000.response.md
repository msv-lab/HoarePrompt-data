Precondition: **The function `func_1` is expected to take a string `s` as an argument, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of `s` is between 1 and 5000 inclusive. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), which is not shown in the function definition provided.**

However, based on the problem description, the function definition should actually be:
```
def func_1(s):
```

To match the problem's requirements, the correct precondition would be:
**s is a string of length between 1 and 5000 inclusive, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.**
