Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list (and must be at least 2), `results` is an empty list, `y` is `x - 3` and must be greater than 0, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` > `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, `best_y` is updated to `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)` updates the value of `gcd_val` to the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
- The previous values of `t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `results`, `y`, `current_sum`, `max_sum`, and `best_y` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, which is calculated using the `math.gcd` function.
- The value of `current_sum` is still `gcd_val + y`.
- The conditions for updating `max_sum` and `best_y` remain the same as in the initial state. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.
