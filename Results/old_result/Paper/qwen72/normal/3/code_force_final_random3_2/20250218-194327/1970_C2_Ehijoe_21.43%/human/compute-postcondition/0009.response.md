Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are input integers, `nodes[u]` now contains the list [v], `nodes[v]` now contains the list [u]**.
