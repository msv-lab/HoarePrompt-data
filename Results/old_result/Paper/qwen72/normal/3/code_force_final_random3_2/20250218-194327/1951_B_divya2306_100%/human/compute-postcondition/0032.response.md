Output State: **`wins` is less than `k`, `win_with_swap` is `wins + 3` and is less than `k - 1`, `i` is `win_with_swap + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The values of `wins`, `win_with_swap`, and `i` remain unchanged, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
