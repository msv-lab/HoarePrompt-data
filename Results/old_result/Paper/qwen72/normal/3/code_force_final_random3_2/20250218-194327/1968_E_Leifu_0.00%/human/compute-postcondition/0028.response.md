Based on the initial state provided:
- `n` is an input integer that must be at least 6.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 6.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Let's break it down step by step:
1. The variable `j` is explicitly given as 6.
2. The `print` statement converts `j` to a string using `str(j)`, which results in the string `'6'`.
3. The `print` statement concatenates `'6'` with a space `' '` and another `'6'`, resulting in the string `'6 6'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **6 6**
