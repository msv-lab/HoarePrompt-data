Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `v` from user input. It checks if `n` is 2 and prints 2 if true. Otherwise, it iterates through the list `v` and prints 2 if `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i` for any `i` from 1 to `n`. If neither condition is met, it prints 3. The function does not return any value. **
