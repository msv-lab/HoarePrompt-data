Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the first element of `arr` if `res` is not '>', otherwise `mini` is the second element of `arr`, `arr` must have at least three elements, `item` is the third element of `arr`, and `res` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code snippet `res = input()` updates the value of `res` to a new input string. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `maxi`, `mini`, `arr`, and `item`) are not affected by this code, so their values remain the same as in the initial state. The new value of `res` is now an input string, which could be different from the previous value of '>'.
