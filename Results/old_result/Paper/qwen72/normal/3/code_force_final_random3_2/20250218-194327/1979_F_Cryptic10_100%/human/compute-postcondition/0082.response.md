Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for the value `len(vx) - 2`, `ops` is an empty list, `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, `v1` is `len(vx) - 1`, `v2` is `0`.**

Explanation:
- The value `v1` (which is `len(vx) - 2`) is removed from the set `vx`.
- The length of `vx` is now reduced by 1, so `v1` is updated to `len(vx) - 1`.
- All other variables (`ops`, `p1`, `p2`, `v2`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 2 still holds.
