Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n - 1`, and `possible` is True. This means that at some point during the loop, either `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, or `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.**
