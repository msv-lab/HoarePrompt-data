Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is the input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the new `s` is '<', `mak` is 1 and `pans` is a list containing `[1]`. If the new `s` is '=', `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]`. If the new `s` is neither '<' nor '=', `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]`.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the terminal or output stream immediately. However, this operation does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged in the output state.
