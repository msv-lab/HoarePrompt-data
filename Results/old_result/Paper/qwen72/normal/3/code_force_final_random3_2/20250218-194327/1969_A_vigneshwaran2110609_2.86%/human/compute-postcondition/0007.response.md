Output: **2**

Explanation:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(2)`.
- This statement prints the integer value `2` directly.
- The initial state provides information about various variables and objects, but none of these are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the output is simply the integer `2`.
