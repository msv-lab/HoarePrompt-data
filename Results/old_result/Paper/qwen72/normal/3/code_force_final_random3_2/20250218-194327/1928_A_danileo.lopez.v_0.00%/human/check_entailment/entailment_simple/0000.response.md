Reasoning:
The program is designed to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the original \( a \times b \) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and then rearranging them. The key condition for forming a different rectangle is that at least one of the dimensions \( a \) or \( b \) must be even. This is because if both dimensions are odd, cutting the rectangle will result in smaller rectangles that, when rearranged, will only form the original rectangle or a rotated version of it, which is considered the same.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then iterates \( t \) times, reading the dimensions \( a \) and \( b \) for each test case.
2. **Condition Check**: For each test case, the program checks if either \( a \) or \( b \) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
3. **Output**: If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Bob can form a different rectangle. If the condition is false, it prints 'No', indicating that Bob cannot form a different rectangle.

The logic is correct because:
- If \( a \) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles and arrange them to form a \( 2 \times \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangle, which is different from \( a \times b \).
- If \( b \) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangles and arrange them to form a \( a \times 2 \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangle, which is different from \( a \times b \).
- If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd, cutting the rectangle will result in smaller rectangles that, when rearranged, will only form the original rectangle or a rotated version of it, which is considered the same.

Given the problem description and the execution states provided, the program correctly implements the required logic.

Correctness: **True**
