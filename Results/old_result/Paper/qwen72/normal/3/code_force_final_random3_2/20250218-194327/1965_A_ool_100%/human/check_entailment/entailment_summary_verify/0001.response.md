### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game.
   - It first checks if the smallest pile size is not 1. If so, Alice can always win by choosing `k` equal to the smallest pile size, which will empty all piles in one move. This is correct.
   - If the smallest pile size is 1, the function then checks if the pile sizes are consecutive. This is done by sorting the unique pile sizes and checking the difference between consecutive elements.
   - If the pile sizes are not consecutive, the function alternates the winning player (`A = not A`) for each step. This is based on the idea that the player who can break the consecutive sequence can force a win. However, this logic is flawed because it does not correctly handle the case where the smallest pile size is 1 and the pile sizes are not consecutive.
   - If the pile sizes are consecutive, the function alternates the winning player one more time (`A = not A`) before returning the result. This is based on the idea that the game is essentially a Nim game with a single pile of size 1, which is a losing position for the player who is forced to make the move. This is also flawed because it does not correctly handle the parity of the number of unique elements.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the smallest pile size is not 1.
   - However, it does not correctly handle the case where the smallest pile size is 1 and the pile sizes are not consecutive. For example, in the test case `1 7`, the function should return "Bob" because Alice must choose `k=1`, leaving Bob with a winning move by choosing `k=6`. The function incorrectly returns "Alice" in this case.
   - The program also does not correctly handle the case where the smallest pile size is 1 and the pile sizes are consecutive. For example, in the test case `1 2 3`, the function should return "Alice" because the number of unique elements is odd. The function incorrectly returns "Bob" in this case.

4. **Optimality**:
   - The program assumes both players play optimally, which is a valid assumption for this problem.
   - However, the logic for determining the winner based on the smallest pile size and the consecutive nature of the pile sizes is flawed.

5. **Output**:
   - The program does not always print the correct winner for each test case due to the logical errors in `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the given problem description. It fails to handle edge cases where the smallest pile size is 1 and the pile sizes are either consecutive or not consecutive.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
