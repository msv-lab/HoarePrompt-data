### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Parsing:**
   - The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(n, x, y, chosen_vertices):`.
   - However, the program correctly reads the number of test cases `tt` and iterates over each test case, parsing the inputs `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the list of chosen vertices `a`.

2. **Sorting the Chosen Vertices:**
   - The program sorts the list `a` of chosen vertices, which is necessary to calculate the differences between consecutive vertices.

3. **Initial Calculation of `ans`:**
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. This is a reasonable starting point because each triangle can be formed by choosing 3 vertices, and the maximum number of triangles that can be formed from `x + y` vertices is `x + y - 2`.

4. **Handling Consecutive Vertices with a Difference of 2:**
   - The program checks for pairs of consecutive vertices in `a` that have a difference of 2 and increments `ans` by 1 for each such pair. This is correct because a difference of 2 means there is one vertex between them, which can be used to form a triangle.

5. **Handling Even Differences:**
   - For pairs of consecutive vertices in `a` that have an even difference greater than 2, the program appends the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. This is correct because an even difference can be split into multiple segments, each of which can potentially form a triangle.

6. **Handling the Wrap-Around Case:**
   - The program also checks the wrap-around case where the difference between the first and last vertices (considering the polygon is cyclic) is 2 or an even number. This is correct and necessary to ensure all possible triangles are considered.

7. **Processing `tmp` List:**
   - The program sorts the `tmp` list and processes each element `i` in `tmp` to increment `ans` by `i` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`. This is correct because it ensures that the maximum number of triangles can be formed by choosing additional vertices.

8. **Final Adjustment of `ans`:**
   - The program adds the remaining value of `y` to `ans` and prints the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`. This is correct because the maximum number of triangles that can be formed in an `n`-sided polygon is `n - 2`.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all the necessary cases and constraints as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
