The code snippet `answers.append('Draw')` adds the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. However, the initial state does not provide information about the list `answers`, so we assume it is a list that can be modified. The other variables (`i`, `test_cases`, and `clues`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, `answers` is a list that now includes the string 'Draw'.**
