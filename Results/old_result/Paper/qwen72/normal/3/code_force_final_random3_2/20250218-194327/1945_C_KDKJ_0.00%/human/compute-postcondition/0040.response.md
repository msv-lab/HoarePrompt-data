Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `left` is the first element of the list `S[i]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is the second element of the last list in `S` minus the second element of the first list in `S`, `rsum` is `n` - `lsum`, `ans` is 0 if the conditions are met.**

Explanation:
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `i` remains 1.
- `left` remains the first element of the list `S[i]`.
- `lsum` is updated to the sum of the first and second elements of the list `S[i]`.
- `right` remains the second element of the last list in `S` minus the second element of the first list in `S`.
- `rsum` remains `n` - `lsum`.
- `ans` remains 0 if the conditions are met.
