Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is the input integer.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input `s` was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input `s` was '<'.
- `pans` must have at least 2 elements.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` for which the input `s` was '<'.

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`pans[mak]`**:
   - `mak` is 0.
   - Therefore, `pans[mak]` is the first element of the `pans` list.

2. **`pans[mak]` (second occurrence)**:
   - Again, `pans[mak]` is the first element of the `pans` list.

3. **`pans[i]`**:
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - Therefore, `pans[i]` is the element at the index `n-1` of the `pans` list.

4. **`pans[i]` (second occurrence)**:
   - Again, `pans[i]` is the element at the index `n-1` of the `pans` list.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output a string that starts with a question mark followed by the first element of the `pans` list, the first element of the `pans` list again, the last element of the `pans` list, and the last element of the `pans` list again.

Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[n-1]] [pans[n-1]] (where pans[0] is the first element of the pans list and pans[n-1] is the last element of the pans list)**
