Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 5 (not divisible by 2), `ans` is 'AAA' + `s[1]` * 2 + `s[2]` * 2, `x` is 2, `j` is 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by appending `s[x] * 2` to its current value.
- The current value of `ans` is 'AAA' + `s[1]` * 2.
- `x` is 2, so `s[2]` is multiplied by 2 and appended to `ans`.
- The new value of `ans` is 'AAA' + `s[1]` * 2 + `s[2]` * 2.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.
