To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that the input provided to the loop is valid and will allow the loop to execute at least once. The function parameters `t`, `n`, `row1`, and `row2` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
