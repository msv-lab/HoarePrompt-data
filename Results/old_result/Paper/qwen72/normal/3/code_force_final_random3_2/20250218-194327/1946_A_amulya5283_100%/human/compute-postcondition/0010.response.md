Output State: **`func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array `a`, and an array `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is an input integer minus 1, and `n` is an input integer. `a` is now a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user, and `n` is greater than 1. `res` is 0. `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.**

Explanation:
- `mdx` is calculated using the expression `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
- `n // 2` gives the integer division of `n` by 2.
- `n % 2` gives the remainder when `n` is divided by 2.
- Adding these two results and subtracting 1 gives the value of `mdx`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
