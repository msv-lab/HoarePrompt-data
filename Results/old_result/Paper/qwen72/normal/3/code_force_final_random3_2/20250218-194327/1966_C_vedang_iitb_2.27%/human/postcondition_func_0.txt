The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of positive integers and returns a sorted list `a_new` containing the unique elements from `a`. Each element `a_new[i]` (for 1 <= i < len(a_new)) is modified to be the difference between `a_new[i]` and the previous element in the original sorted unique list `a_temp[i - 1]`. The length of `a_new` is the same as the number of unique elements in `a`.
