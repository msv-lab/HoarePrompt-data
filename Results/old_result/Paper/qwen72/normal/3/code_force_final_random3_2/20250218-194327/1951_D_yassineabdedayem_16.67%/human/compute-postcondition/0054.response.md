Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the input, `rep` is 0, `number` is the last value of either `Min` or `Max` computed in the loop, and `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all the `number` values computed during the loop. If `k` is 0, all elements of `tab` have been printed. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to 0 and `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max` for each iteration.**
