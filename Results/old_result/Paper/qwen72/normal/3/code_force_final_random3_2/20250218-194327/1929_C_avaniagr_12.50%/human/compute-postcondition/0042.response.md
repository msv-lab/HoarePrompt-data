Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `a` is an input integer, `z` is 1, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `z` is updated by the expression `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`. Initially, `z` is 0. When `z` is 0, `z // (k - 1)` is 0 for any valid `k` (since 1 <= t <= 1000 and `k` is an input integer, `k - 1` is at least 0, and division by zero is not a concern here because `z` is 0). Therefore, `z` becomes `0 + 1`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
