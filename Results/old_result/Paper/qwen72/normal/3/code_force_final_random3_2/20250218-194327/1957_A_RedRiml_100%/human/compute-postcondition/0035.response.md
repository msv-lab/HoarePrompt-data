Postcondition: ***`pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 2 elements, `j` is the second element of `pl`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged.***
