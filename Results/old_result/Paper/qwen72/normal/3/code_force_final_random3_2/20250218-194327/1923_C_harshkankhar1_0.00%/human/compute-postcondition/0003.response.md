To ensure the for loop executes, we need to consider the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`, which means the loop will iterate from `1` to `n` (inclusive). For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least `1` (since the range starts from `1` and goes up to `n`).

The variable `i` is the loop counter, and it will start at `1` when the loop begins. We do not need to adjust `i` because it is automatically set by the `range` function.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it is a positive integer, which is already given in the initial state. However, to make it explicit, we can state that `n` must be greater than `0`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is 1**
