To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the objects that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `key` and `nodes`.

1. **`key`**: The loop iterates over the keys of the `nodes` dictionary. After the previous iteration, `key` is the first key in `nodes`. For the next iteration, `key` will be the next key in the dictionary.

2. **`nodes`**: The dictionary `nodes` must still have at least one key for the loop to continue. Since the loop has already executed once, `nodes` must have at least two keys for the loop to execute again.

3. **Other Variables**: Variables like `n`, `i`, `empty`, and `ends` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is `n-2`.
- `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list with at least one key.
- `key` is the first key in `nodes`.
- `empty` remains `True`.
- If `len(nodes[key]) == 1`, `ends` is a list containing the first key in `nodes`. Otherwise, `ends` remains an empty list.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `nodes` must have at least two keys.
- `key` will be the second key in `nodes`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list with at least two keys, `key` is the second key in `nodes`, `empty` remains `True`, `ends` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration**.
