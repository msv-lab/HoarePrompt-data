The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if the result of `int(input())` is greater than the current value of `_`.

At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, and `func_1()` has been called. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `int(input())` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `_` is 2
- `int(input())` must be greater than 1

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, and `func_1()` has been called.**
