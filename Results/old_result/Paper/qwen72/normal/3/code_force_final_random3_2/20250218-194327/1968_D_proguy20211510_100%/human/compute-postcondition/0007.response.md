Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.** 

The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into multiple strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `a`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `_`, and `p`) remain unchanged.
