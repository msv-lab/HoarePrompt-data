The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `power < log2(n)`. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 2, and `n` is an input integer greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must still be less than `log2(n)`. Since `power` is 2, `log2(n)` must be greater than 2. This condition is already met because `n` is greater than 2, and the logarithm base 2 of any number greater than 2 is greater than 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n`.

However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to increment `power` to 3, and `log2(n)` must still be greater than 3. This means `n` must be greater than 8 (since `log2(8) = 3`).

State: **`n_cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 8, `power` is 3**
