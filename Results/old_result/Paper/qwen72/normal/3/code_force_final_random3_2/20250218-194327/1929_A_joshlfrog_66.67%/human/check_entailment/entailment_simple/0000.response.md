### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array after rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_i-1)` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.

To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the beauty as follows:

- The maximum value in the sorted array will be the last element.
- The minimum value in the sorted array will be the first element.
- The beauty will be maximized by the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is `(max_value - min_value)`.

However, the given program does not sort the array. Instead, it directly finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference. This approach is correct because the maximum beauty is indeed the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, regardless of the order of the other elements.

### Explanation of the Program:

1. **Reading the Number of Test Cases:**
   - `t = int(input())` reads the number of test cases.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - `for e in range(t):` iterates over each test case.
   - `l = int(input())` reads the length of the array for the current test case.
   - `nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` reads the array elements as a list of integers.

3. **Finding the Maximum and Minimum Values:**
   - `x = 0` initializes `x` to 0, which will store the maximum value.
   - `y = 100000000` initializes `y` to a large value, which will store the minimum value.
   - `for i in range(l):` iterates over each element in the array.
     - `if nums[i] > x:` updates `x` to the maximum value found so far.
     - `if nums[i] < y:` updates `y` to the minimum value found so far.

4. **Calculating and Printing the Beauty:**
   - `print(x - y)` prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is the maximum beauty.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference, which is the maximum beauty of the array. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
