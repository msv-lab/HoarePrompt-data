The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. Since the value of `int(input())` is determined by user input and does not change during the loop, we cannot adjust it. We can only adjust the state of `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `int(input())`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is an input integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `y` is `x // 2`, `i` is 2, and `t` must be greater than 1**
