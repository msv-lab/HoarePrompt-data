Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `arr` is a list containing the integers for which `res` was either '<' or '=' during the loop iterations, `mini` is the first element of `arr`.
Code of the loop:
for item in arr[1:]:
    print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '>':
        mini = item


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `arr` is a list containing the integers for which `res` was either '<' or '=' during the loop iterations and must have at least 2 elements, `mini` is the second element of `arr`, `item` is the second element of `arr`. If `res` is '>', then the current value of `res` is '>' and `mini` is the second element of `arr`. Otherwise, the value of `res` is not '>', and the original conditions for `mini` and `item` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `arr` is a list containing the integers for which `res` was either '<' or '=' during the loop iterations and must have at least 3 elements. If `res` is '>', `mini` is the third element of `arr`, and `item` is the third element of `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` remains the second element of `arr`, and `item` remains the third element of `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `arr` is a list containing the integers for which `res` was either '<' or '=' during the loop iterations and must have at least 4 elements, `item` is the fourth element of `arr`. If `res` is '>', `mini` is the fourth element of `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` remains the second element of `arr` if `res` is not '>', or the third element of `arr` if `res` is '='. `res` is the new input value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
