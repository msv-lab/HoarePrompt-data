Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `a`, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements are 0.** 

The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, so the element at index `i` in the list `cntl` is now 1. The other elements in `cntl` remain 0. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
