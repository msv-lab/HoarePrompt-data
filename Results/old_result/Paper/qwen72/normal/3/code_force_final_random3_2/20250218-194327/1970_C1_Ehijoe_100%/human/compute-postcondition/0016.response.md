Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list where each key (node) has a list of its connected nodes (edges), and each node `u` and `v` that were input during the loop execution are appended to each other's lists. `empty` remains `True` since it is not modified within the loop.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations:
- The variable `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, as the loop runs `n-1` times.
- The loop index `i` will be `n-2` after the last iteration.
- The `nodes` dictionary will contain all the nodes from the input, and each node will have a list of its connected nodes (i.e., the nodes it is directly connected to by an edge).
- The `empty` variable remains `True` because it is not modified within the loop.
