The `wrapper` function does not explicitly accept parameters but uses a tuple `args` and a dictionary `d` that are assumed to be defined in the outer scope. It checks if `args` is a key in the dictionary `d`. If `args` is not in `d`, it computes the result of `func(*args)`, stores this result in `d` with `args` as the key, and returns the result. If `args` is already in `d`, it simply returns the value associated with `args` in `d`. In both cases, the function ensures that `d` contains the result of `func(*args)` for the given `args`.
