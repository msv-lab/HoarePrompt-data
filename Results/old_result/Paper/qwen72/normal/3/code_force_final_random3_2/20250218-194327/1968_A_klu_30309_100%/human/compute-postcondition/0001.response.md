The only objects in the loop head are `x` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If the list has at least one integer, the loop will execute. The variable `t` and the list `results` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list, `results` is an empty list**
