Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list (and must be at least 2), `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is `x - 1`.**

Explanation:
- `current_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y`.
- `gcd_val` is 1.
- `y` is `x - 2`.
- Therefore, `current_sum` becomes `1 + (x - 2)`, which simplifies to `x - 1`.
- The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `results`, `max_sum`, `best_y`, and `gcd_val` remain unchanged.
