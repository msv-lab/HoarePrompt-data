The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 5. For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 5.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 5**
