The code snippet `func_2()` calls a function named `func_2`, but there is no information provided about what this function does or what it returns. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific changes it makes to the program state. However, the initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is a placeholder that does not affect the loop's execution. These conditions remain unchanged unless `func_2` explicitly modifies them, which we have no information about.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution.**
