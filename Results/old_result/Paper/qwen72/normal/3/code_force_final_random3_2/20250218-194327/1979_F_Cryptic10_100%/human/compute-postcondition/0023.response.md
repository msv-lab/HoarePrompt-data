Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 2 and at least 4, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, with `v1` and `v2` removed, `len(vx) > 1`, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 1)`, where `len(vx) - 1` is the number of elements in `vx` minus 1.**

Explanation:
- `int(input())` remains greater than 2 and at least 4.
- `vx` initially contained integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, with `v1` removed. After executing `vx.remove(v1)`, `v1` is removed again, so now `vx` contains integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, with both `v1` and `v2` removed.
- The length of `vx` is now `len(vx) - 1`, which is still greater than 1.
- `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 1)`, where `len(vx) - 1` is the number of elements in `vx` minus 1.
