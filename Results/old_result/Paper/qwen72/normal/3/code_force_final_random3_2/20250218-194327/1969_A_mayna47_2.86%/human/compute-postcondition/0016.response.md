Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50.
   - `v[v[v[2]]]` is not equal to 2. If `v[v[v[2]]]` is equal to 2, the program returns nothing. Otherwise, the program also returns nothing.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The initial state specifies that `v[v[v[2]]]` is not equal to 2. This means that the condition `v[v[v[2]]] == 2` is false.
   - The initial state also mentions that if `v[v[v[2]]]` is equal to 2, the program returns nothing. However, since `v[v[v[2]]]` is not equal to 2, this condition does not apply.
   - The statement `print(2)` is executed regardless of the condition mentioned in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print(2)` statement will print the integer 2.

Output: **2**
