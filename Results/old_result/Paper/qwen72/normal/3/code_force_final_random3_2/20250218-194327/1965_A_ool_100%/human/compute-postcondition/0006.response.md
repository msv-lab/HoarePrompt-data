Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive; `A` is False; `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr`, and the first element of `set_` is 1; `not_c` is True.**

The code snippet assigns `True` to the variable `not_c`. The other variables and their initial states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `not_c` as `True` and retains the initial states of `arr`, `A`, and `set_`.
