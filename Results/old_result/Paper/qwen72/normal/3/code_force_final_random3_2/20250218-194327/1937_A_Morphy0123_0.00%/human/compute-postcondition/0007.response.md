To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the loop condition: `power < log2(n)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `power`
   - `n`

2. **Current State:**
   - `power` is 1
   - `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 1

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `power < log2(n)` is true.

4. **Initial Values:**
   - `power` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 1.

5. **Adjustment Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `log2(n)` must be greater than 1.
   - `log2(n) > 1` implies that `n > 2` (since \(2^1 = 2\)).

### Conclusion:
To ensure that the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 2. The other variables (`n_cases`, `i`) are not part of the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 2; `power` is 1**
