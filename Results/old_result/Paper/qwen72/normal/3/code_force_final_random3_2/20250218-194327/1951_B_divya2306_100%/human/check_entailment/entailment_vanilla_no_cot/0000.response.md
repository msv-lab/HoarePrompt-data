Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Function Call in Main Loop**:
   - The main loop calls `func_1()` but does not pass any arguments. However, `func_1()` should be called with the test case inputs.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Wins Calculation**:
   - The logic for calculating the number of wins without swapping is incorrect. It should stop counting wins when the cow at position `k` loses, not when any cow with a higher rating is encountered.
   - The logic for calculating the number of wins with a swap is also flawed. It does not correctly handle the scenario where the cow at position `k` is swapped to a different position and then the number of wins is recalculated.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Swap**:
   - The program does not correctly determine the optimal position to swap the cow to maximize the number of wins. It should consider swapping the cow to a position where it can win the most matches.

### Corrected Program:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max_wins(n, k, a))

def max_wins(n, k, a):
    # Calculate the number of wins without swapping
    wins = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[k - 1]:
            wins += 1
        else:
            break
    
    # Calculate the number of wins with an optimal swap
    win_with_swap = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i == k - 1:
            continue
        # Simulate the swap
        a[i], a[k - 1] = a[k - 1], a[i]
        current_wins = 0
        for j in range(1, n):
            if a[j] < a[k - 1]:
                current_wins += 1
            else:
                break
        win_with_swap = max(win_with_swap, current_wins)
        # Revert the swap
        a[i], a[k - 1] = a[k - 1], a[i]
    
    return max(wins, win_with_swap)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by calling the `max_wins` function with the appropriate arguments.

2. **max_wins Function**:
   - **Without Swap**:
     - It calculates the number of wins the cow at position `k` can achieve without any swaps by iterating through the list and counting wins until the cow loses.
   - **With Swap**:
     - It iterates through all possible positions to swap the cow to.
     - For each position, it simulates the swap, calculates the number of wins, and then reverts the swap.
     - It keeps track of the maximum number of wins achieved with any swap.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum number of wins between the no-swap and optimal swap scenarios.

This corrected program should correctly solve the problem as described.
