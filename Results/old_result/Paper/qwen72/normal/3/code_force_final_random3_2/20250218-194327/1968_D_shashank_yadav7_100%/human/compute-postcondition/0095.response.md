Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 1` if `k` was greater than 0 initially and the loop executed fully, otherwise `i` is the value at the time `k` became 0.
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `k` is 0 if the loop executed fully or the value at the time `k` became 0.
- `b` is the final value of `b` after `b = p[b] - 1` was executed as many times as the loop ran.
- `s` is the final value of `s` after `s = p[s] - 1` was executed as many times as the loop ran.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `p` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `sp` is the sum of the initial `sp` and all values of `a[s]` added during the loop.
- `bp` is the sum of the initial `bp` and all values of `a[b]` added during the loop.
- `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` computed during the loop.
- `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` computed during the loop.
- `bm` is greater than `sm`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Bodya')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Bodya'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and their values, but it does not affect the `print` statement in any way because the `print` statement is not dependent on any of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'Bodya'`.

Output: **Bodya**
