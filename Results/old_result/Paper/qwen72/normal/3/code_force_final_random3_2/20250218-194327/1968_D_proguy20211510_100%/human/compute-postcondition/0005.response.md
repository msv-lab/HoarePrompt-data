Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop.** 

The initial state specifies that `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop. The code snippet converts the strings `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` to integers. After the conversion, `n` remains an integer greater than 0, while `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are now integers. The state of `_` remains unchanged.
