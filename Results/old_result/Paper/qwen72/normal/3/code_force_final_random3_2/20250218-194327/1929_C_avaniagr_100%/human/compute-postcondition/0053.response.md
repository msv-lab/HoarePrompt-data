Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer in the third line of the file, `x` is the second integer in the third line of the file, `a` is the third integer in the third line of the file, the file opened by `open(0)` must have at least 3 lines, and `s` is the third line of the file. If `x` < `k` - 1, and if `a` >= `x` + 1, no changes are made to `a` and `x`. If `x` >= `k` - 1, and if `x` == `k` - 1, no variables are modified. Otherwise, `z` is now the result of the loop expression after `x - k + 3` iterations, `x - k + 3` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `i` is `x - k + 2`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, no changes are made to `a` and `z`. If `a` is less than `z`, no changes are made to `a` and `z`.***
