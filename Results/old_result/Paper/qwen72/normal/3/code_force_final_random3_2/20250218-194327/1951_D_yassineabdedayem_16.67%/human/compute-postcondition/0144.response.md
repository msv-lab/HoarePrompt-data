The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `tab`. For the loop to execute, `tab` must contain at least one element. The state of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `rep` are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is 0
- `k` is 0
- `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (which is at most 60)
- `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the `number` values computed during each iteration of the loop

To ensure the loop executes, `tab` must have at least one element, and `i` will be the first element of `tab`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (which is at most 60), `tab` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `tab`**
