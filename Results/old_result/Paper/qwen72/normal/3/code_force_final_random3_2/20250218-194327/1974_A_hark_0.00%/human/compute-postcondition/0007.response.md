Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `func_2()` has been called `t` times.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the input integer `t` must have been at least 1, and the function `func_2()` has been called exactly `t` times. The loop iterates `t` times, and each iteration calls `func_2()`, so by the end of the loop, `func_2()` will have been called `t` times. The placeholder `_` does not affect the loop's execution and is simply used to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body.
