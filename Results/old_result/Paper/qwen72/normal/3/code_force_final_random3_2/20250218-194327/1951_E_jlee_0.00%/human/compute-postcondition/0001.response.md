To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, as it is the first index in the range of `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is assigned the value of an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `s` is a list of strings where each string consists of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6).
- The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

The state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
