Output State: **`input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `2 + n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[2]` to `data[2 + n - 1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by `n`, so `idx` is now `2 + n`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
