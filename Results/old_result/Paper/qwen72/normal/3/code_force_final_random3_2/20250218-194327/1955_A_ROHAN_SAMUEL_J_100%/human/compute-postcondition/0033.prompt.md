Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers where 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if n % 2:
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b + a)
    elif 2 * a < b:
        print(a * n)
    else:
        print(n // 2 * b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are the second and third integers input by the user, respectively. If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is less than `b`, the condition `2 * a < b` holds. If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the condition `2 * a >= b` holds. If `n` is even and `2 * a` is less than `b`, the condition `2 * a < b` holds. If `n` is even and `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the condition `2 * a >= b` holds.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers input by the user, and `n` is greater than 0. If `2 * a < b`, the condition `2 * a < b` holds. If `2 * a >= b`, the condition `2 * a >= b` holds. The parity of `n` (whether it is odd or even) does not affect the final conditions, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`_` is 2, `n`, `a`, and `b` are the new integer values input by the user. If `n` is odd, the condition `2 * a < b` or `2 * a >= b` holds based on the new values of `a` and `b`. If `n` is even, the condition `2 * a < b` or `2 * a >= b` also holds based on the new values of `a` and `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
