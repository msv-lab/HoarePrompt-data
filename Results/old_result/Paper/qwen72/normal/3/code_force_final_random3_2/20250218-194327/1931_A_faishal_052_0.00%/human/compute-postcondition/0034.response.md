Postcondition: ***`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing either the element 1 or the integer 26, and now includes an additional element (1 if `lex` <= 26, otherwise 26). `lex` is updated as follows: if `lex` was less than or equal to 26, it is now less than or equal to 25; if `lex` was between 26 and 51, it is updated to a value between 0 and 25; if `lex` was between 52 and 100, it is updated to `lex - 26` and is now between 26 and 74. `j` is 2.***
