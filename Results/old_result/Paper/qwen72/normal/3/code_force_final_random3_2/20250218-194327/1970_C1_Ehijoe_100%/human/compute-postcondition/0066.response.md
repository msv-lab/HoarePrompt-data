The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. Instead, it reads input from the standard input. The input consists of:
- The first line containing two integers `n` and `t`, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5` and `t = 1`.
- The next `n-1` lines, each containing two integers `u` and `v` (with `1 ≤ u, v ≤ n`), representing edges of a tree.
- The last line containing a single integer `u_1` (with `1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n`), representing the starting node.

The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. The function returns the distance between the two leaves of the tree.

Functionality: **The function reads a tree structure and a starting node from standard input and returns the distance between the two leaves of the tree.**
