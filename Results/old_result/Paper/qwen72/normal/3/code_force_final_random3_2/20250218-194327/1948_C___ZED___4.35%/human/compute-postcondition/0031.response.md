Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with the second-to-last character being '>', `k` is 3, `no_path` is False.**

The code snippet sets `no_path` to `False`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k`) remain unchanged. The initial condition that `no_path` is `False` if the character at index `k` in `a` is not '>', and `True` otherwise, is now explicitly set to `False`. Therefore, the output state reflects this change while keeping all other initial conditions intact.
