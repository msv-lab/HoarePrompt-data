Postcondition: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for the value `len(vx) - 2`. `ops` is an empty list. `int(input())` must be greater than 2. `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`. `p2` is an empty list. `v1` is `len(vx) - 1`. `v2` is greater than 0.**
