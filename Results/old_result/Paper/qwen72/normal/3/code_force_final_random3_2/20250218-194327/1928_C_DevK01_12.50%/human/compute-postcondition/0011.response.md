Output State: **`q` is at least 4, `w` is the integer square root of `q` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `q` is divisible by `i` without any remainder, `M` is a list containing `[1, q // i]`, and the current value of `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `q` remains at least 4.
- The value of `w` remains the integer square root of `q` and is greater than 1.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- `q` is still divisible by `i` without any remainder.
- The list `M` now contains `[1, q // i]` after appending the value `q // i`.
- The condition that `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` is still valid, and the current value of `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
