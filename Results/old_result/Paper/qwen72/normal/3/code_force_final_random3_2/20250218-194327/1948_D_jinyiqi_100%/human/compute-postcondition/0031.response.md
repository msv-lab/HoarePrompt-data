To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for k in range(0, n - j):
```

The variables in the loop head are `k`, `n`, and `j`. The loop will execute if the range `range(0, n - j)` is not empty, which means `n - j` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string, where the input string consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of the input string is between 1 and 5000 inclusive.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2.
- `j` is 0.
- `k` is `n - j`.
- `count` is 0.
- The program has not printed anything or returned.

Let's analyze the conditions:
- `n` is at least 2, so `n` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 0, so `n - j` is `n`, which is at least 2.
- Therefore, `range(0, n - j)` will be `range(0, n)`, which is not empty and will have at least 2 elements (since `n` is at least 2).

Since `n - j` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. However, the initial state of `k` is `n - j`, which is not the correct state for the loop to start. The loop variable `k` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string, where the input string consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of the input string is between 1 and 5000 inclusive.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2.
- `j` is 0.
- `k` is 0 (since `k` will be set to 0 at the start of the loop).
- `count` is 0.
- The program has not printed anything or returned.

State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string, where the input string consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of the input string is between 1 and 5000 inclusive; `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2; `j` is 0; `k` is 0; `count` is 0; the program has not printed anything or returned.**
