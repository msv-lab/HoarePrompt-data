Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the input. The function checks if the string `s` meets certain conditions based on the value of `n` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. Specifically, if `n` is 2, it prints 'YES' if `s` is '00', otherwise 'NO'. If `n` is not 2, it prints 'NO' if the number of '1's in `s` is odd, or if there is exactly one occurrence of '11' and exactly two '1's in `s`. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` being 0. **
