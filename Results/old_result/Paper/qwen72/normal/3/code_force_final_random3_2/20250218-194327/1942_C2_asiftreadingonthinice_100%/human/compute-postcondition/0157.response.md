Output State: **`a` is sorted in ascending order. `ans` is `x + y - 1 + count_of_pairs_with_difference_2` if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2 + count_of_pairs_with_difference_2`. `y` is reduced by the sum of `(i - 1)` for all elements `i` in `tmp` that were processed in the loop, where `y` was greater than or equal to `(i - 1)`. `x` and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is the last element in `tmp` that was processed in the loop. `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list containing the integer results of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number and not equal to 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2 and is even, then `tmp` also includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`a`**: The list `a` remains sorted in ascending order, as it was initially.
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` is updated based on the initial condition and the loop. If the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is 2, `ans` starts as `x + y - 1 + count_of_pairs_with_difference_2`. Otherwise, it starts as `x + y - 2 + count_of_pairs_with_difference_2`. For each element `i` in `tmp` that is processed in the loop, if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is incremented by `i`, and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`.
- **`y`**: The value of `y` is reduced by the sum of `(i - 1)` for all elements `i` in `tmp` that were processed in the loop, where `y` was greater than or equal to `i - 1`.
- **`x` and `chosen_vertices`**: These variables remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`ii` and `tt`**: `ii` is still `tt`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`.
- **`i`**: `i` is the last element in `tmp` that was processed in the loop.
- **`tmp`**: `tmp` remains a non-empty sorted list containing the integer results of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number and not equal to 2. If the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is not equal to 2 and is even, `tmp` also includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.
