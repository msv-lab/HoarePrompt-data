Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` exists.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `n` remains the same as it was in the initial state.
- The variable `i` has the value `n-1`, which is the last value it takes in the loop.
- The variable `maxi` will be the largest value of `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during any of the loop iterations. If no such `i` exists, `maxi` will remain 0.
