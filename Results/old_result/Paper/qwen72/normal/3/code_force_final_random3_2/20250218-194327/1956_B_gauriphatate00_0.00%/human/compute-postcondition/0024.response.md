Output State: **`input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `1 + (t * (n + 1))`, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration, where `n` and `a` are updated according to the input data for each iteration.**

In natural language, this means:
- The `input` variable remains a reference to `sys.stdin.read`.
- The `data` list remains unchanged and still contains all the strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`.
- The `idx` variable is now equal to `1 + (t * (n + 1))`, where `t` is the initial number of iterations and `n` is the number of elements read in each iteration.
- The `t` variable is now 0, indicating that all iterations have been completed.
- The `results` list contains `t` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration. The values of `n` and `a` are updated for each iteration based on the input data.
