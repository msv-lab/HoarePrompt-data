The given `print` statement simply prints the integer `1`. The initial state provides information about variables `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is independent of the initial state and will always be `1`.

Output: **1**
