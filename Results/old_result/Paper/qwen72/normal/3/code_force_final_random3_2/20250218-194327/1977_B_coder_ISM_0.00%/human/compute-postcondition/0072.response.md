The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `length`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `length`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `length` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `length` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `length` is greater than 2. If `s[2]` is '-1' and `s[1]` is '1', then `s[2]` is set to '0' and `s[1]` is set to '-1'. Otherwise, `s[2]` and `s[1]` retain their original values.**
