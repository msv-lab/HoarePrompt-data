Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the subsequent `n` elements are the `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `a` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0` as well as any indices `i` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0` for `1 <= i <= n`, `sb` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `b` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, and the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sa[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sa[:n // 4 - 1]:
            nx += 'F'
        else:
            nx += 'S'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, and `nx` is a string that contains the characters from `xx[1]` (excluding any '?') or 'F' for positions where `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa` and the corresponding character in `xx[1]` is '?', or 'S' for positions where the corresponding character in `xx[1]` is '?' and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `nx` is a string that has been constructed by iterating over the first `n` characters of the string `xx[2]`. For each character in `xx[2]` at position `j - 1` (where `j` ranges from 1 to `n`), if the character is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If the character is '?', and either `i` (which is 2) or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, 'F' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `nx` is the string constructed by iterating through the characters of the string at index 3 in `xx` from index 0 to index `n-1`. For each character, if it is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If it is '?', and either `i` is in the slice `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or the current index `j` is in the slice `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then 'F' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
