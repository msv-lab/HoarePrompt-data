Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `left` is the first element of the first list in `S`, `lsum` is the sum of the first and second elements of the first list in `S`, `right` is the second element of the last list in `S` minus the second element of the first list in `S`, `rsum` is `n` - `lsum`, `ans` is 0, and either `left * 2` is greater than or equal to `lsum` or `right * 2` is greater than or equal to `rsum`. Additionally, the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`.**
