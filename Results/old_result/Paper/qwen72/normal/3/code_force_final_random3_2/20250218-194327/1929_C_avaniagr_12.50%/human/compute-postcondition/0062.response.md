Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.*** 

Since both the if and else parts result in the same postconditions, the overall postcondition remains unchanged regardless of whether the condition `a >= x + 3` is true or false.
