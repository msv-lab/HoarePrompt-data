The variables in the loop head are `left` and `right`. The loop condition is `left <= right`. Given the initial state, `left` is 0 and `right` is `n - 1`. Since `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `right` will be at least 1 (when `n` is 2) and at most 99 (when `n` is 100). Therefore, `left` (which is 0) is always less than or equal to `right` (which is at least 1), ensuring that the loop condition `left <= right` is true for the first iteration.

No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `new_arr` is an empty list, `left` is 0, `right` is `n - 1`**
