Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 3, `xx` is a list that includes the list `x` as its last element, `i` is `n`, `x` is the new input string, `a[i]` is incremented by 1, and if the second character of `x` is 'F', `a[j]` and `a[n]` are incremented by 1. If the second character of `x` is not 'F' and the first character of `x` is 'S', `b[j]` and `b[n]` are incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `b[1]` and `b[n]` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `a[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is `n`.
- If the second character of `x` is 'F', both `a[j]` and `a[n]` are incremented by 1.
- If the second character of `x` is not 'F' and the first character of `x` is 'S', both `b[j]` and `b[n]` are incremented by 1.
- Otherwise, the values of `b[1]` and `b[n]` remain unchanged.
- The initial state values for `n`, `j`, `xx`, `i`, and `x` remain the same.
