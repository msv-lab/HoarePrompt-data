Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program always prints `x - 2`, which is incorrect for several cases. Let's consider a few examples:

1. **Case 1:**
   - Input: `8 4 0` and vertices `1 6 2 5`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Actual Output: `2`
   - This case works correctly, but it is not a general solution.

2. **Case 2:**
   - Input: `8 8 0` and vertices `1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8`
   - Expected Output: `6`
   - Actual Output: `6`
   - This case also works correctly, but again, it is not a general solution.

3. **Case 3:**
   - Input: `4 2 0` and vertices `1 3`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Actual Output: `0`
   - This case fails because the program does not account for the fact that a quadrilateral with two chosen vertices can be divided into two triangles by drawing a single diagonal.

4. **Case 4:**
   - Input: `5 2 0` and vertices `1 3`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Actual Output: `0`
   - This case fails because the program does not account for the fact that a pentagon with two chosen vertices can be divided into one triangle by drawing a single diagonal.

The program does not handle the general case where the number of chosen vertices and the structure of the polygon can vary. It simply subtracts 2 from the number of chosen vertices, which is not a valid approach for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
