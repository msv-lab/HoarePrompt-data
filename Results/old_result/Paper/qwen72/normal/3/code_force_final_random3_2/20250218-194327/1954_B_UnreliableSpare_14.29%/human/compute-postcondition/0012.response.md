The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which means `n` must be greater than 3).

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `flag` remains unchanged**
