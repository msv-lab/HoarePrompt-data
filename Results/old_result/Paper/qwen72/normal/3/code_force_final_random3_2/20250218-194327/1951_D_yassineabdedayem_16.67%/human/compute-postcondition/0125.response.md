Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer or 0 and must be greater than `Min`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Max`, and `k` is `k - Min` (which is `k - min(n // k, k)`).**

In natural language: The value of `k` is updated to `k - Min`, where `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`. All other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)`, and it must still be a positive integer or 0 and greater than `Min`. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, and `number` remain valid.
