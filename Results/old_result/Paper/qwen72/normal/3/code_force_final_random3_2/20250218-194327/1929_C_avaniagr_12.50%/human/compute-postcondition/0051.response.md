Let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `z` is calculated as \(x + 1 + x // (k - 1)\).
   - `i` is set to `x`.
   - `a` is less than `z`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('NO')`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement is a simple string literal `'NO'`.
   - The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `z`, and `i` do not affect the print statement because the print statement does not reference any of these variables.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The print statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables.

Output: **NO**
