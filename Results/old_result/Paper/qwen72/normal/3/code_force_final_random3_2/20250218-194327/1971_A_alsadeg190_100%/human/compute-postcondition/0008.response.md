The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `x` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`x` and `y` are input integers, `i` is 1. If `x` is less than `y`, then `x` is less than `y`. Otherwise, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`.**
