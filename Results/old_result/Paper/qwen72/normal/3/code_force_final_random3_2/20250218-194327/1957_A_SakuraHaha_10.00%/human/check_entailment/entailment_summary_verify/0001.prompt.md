You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from user input. It then calculates the number of groups of four sticks that can be formed from each unique stick length in the list `a` and prints this number. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result of the calculation for the current test case. The function is designed to be called multiple times, once for each test case, but the handling of multiple test cases is not shown in the provided code.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks `a`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - This is done by iterating over the list of stick lengths and updating the dictionary.

3. **Calculating the Number of Polygons:**
   - The program iterates over the values in the dictionary `cnt` to determine how many regular polygons can be formed.
   - It uses the formula `x // 4` to calculate the number of polygons that can be formed with sticks of length `x`. This is because a regular polygon with 4 sides (a square) is the smallest regular polygon that can be formed.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

However, there is a critical issue in the logic:
- The program assumes that all polygons are squares (4-sided polygons). This is incorrect because the problem statement allows for any regular polygon (e.g., triangles, pentagons, hexagons, etc.).

To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider the possibility of forming polygons with any number of sides greater than or equal to 3. The correct approach would be to find the maximum number of polygons that can be formed by dividing the count of each stick length by the smallest possible number of sides (3) and then summing these values.

Given the current implementation, the program will not produce the correct output for test cases where polygons with more than 4 sides can be formed.

Correctness: **False**
