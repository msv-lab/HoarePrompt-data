Output State: **The function should take three parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n (1 ≤ n[i] ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds played in each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains a trump suit (one of "CDHS") and a list of 2n[i] unique card descriptions (each card description is a two-character string, the first character is the rank of the card, which is one of "23456789", and the second one is the suit of the card, which is one of "CDHS"). The initial state remains unchanged, and no new variables are introduced.**
