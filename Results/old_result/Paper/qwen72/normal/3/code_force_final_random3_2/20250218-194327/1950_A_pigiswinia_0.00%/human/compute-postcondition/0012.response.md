The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 < t <= 1000, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is less than `c`. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`. If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` is true. Otherwise, the condition `a < b > c` is false, and it is not the case that `a < b < c`.**
