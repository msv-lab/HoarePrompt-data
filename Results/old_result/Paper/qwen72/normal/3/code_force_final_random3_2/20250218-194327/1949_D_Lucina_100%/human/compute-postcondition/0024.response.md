The code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the list `a` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `i` or the list `a`. Therefore, the output state can only be described in terms of the changes to `a[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `j` is 3, the value at index `i` of the list `a` is incremented by 1.**
