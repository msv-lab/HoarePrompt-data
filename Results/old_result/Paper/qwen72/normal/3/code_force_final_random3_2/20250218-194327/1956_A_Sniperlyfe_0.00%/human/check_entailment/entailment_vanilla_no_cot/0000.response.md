Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program has a logical issue in the `func_2` function. Specifically, the `print` statement is inside the loop that iterates over each query `n` in `qs`. This means that the program will print the results after processing each query, rather than printing all the results at once after processing all queries. This will lead to incorrect output formatting, as the problem description requires that all results for a test case should be printed on a single line.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_2` function:

```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

With this correction, the program will correctly print the results for each test case on a single line, as required by the problem description.
