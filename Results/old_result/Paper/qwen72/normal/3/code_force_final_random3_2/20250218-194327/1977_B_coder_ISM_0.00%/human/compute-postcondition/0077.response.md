The code snippet `s[i] = '0'` modifies the string `s` at the index `i` to be the character `'0'`. Given that `i` is 3 and `length` must be greater than 3, the string `s` is modified such that the character at index 3 is now `'0'`. The values of `i` and `length` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `length` must be greater than 3, `s` is modified such that the character at index 3 is `'0'`.**
