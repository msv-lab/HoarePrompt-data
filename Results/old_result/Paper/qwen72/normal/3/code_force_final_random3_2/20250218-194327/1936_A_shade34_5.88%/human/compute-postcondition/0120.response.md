Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `_` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed, `s` is the new input string, and `mak2` is equal to `mak`. If `s` is '<', `pans` is a list containing `[1]`, and `mak` is 2. If `s` is '=', `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]`, and `mak` is 2. If `s` is neither '<' nor '=', `pans` remains an empty list, and `mak` is 2.**
