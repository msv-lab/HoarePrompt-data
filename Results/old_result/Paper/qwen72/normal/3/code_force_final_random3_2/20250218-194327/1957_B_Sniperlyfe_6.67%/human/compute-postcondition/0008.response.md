Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `nums[2]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, `k` and `nums` remain unchanged otherwise.**

### Explanation:
- `i` is 2, as it was incremented by 1 from the initial state.
- `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.
- The value of `nums[2]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This expression calculates a value based on the bit length of `k`.
- The state of `k` and the rest of `nums` remains unchanged.
