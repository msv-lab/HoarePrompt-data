The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from user input, where both `x` and `y` are in the range 0 to 99. It then prints a result based on the values of `x` and `y`:
- If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it prints the sum of `math.ceil(y / 2)` and `math.ceil((x - math.ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4) / 15) + 1` if the updated `x` is greater than 0, otherwise it prints `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
- If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it prints `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
- If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
- If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.
