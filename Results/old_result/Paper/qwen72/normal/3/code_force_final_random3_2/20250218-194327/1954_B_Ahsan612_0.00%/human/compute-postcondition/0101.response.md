Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and `len(ar)` must be greater than 3, `i` is now 4, `num` is now `ar[3]`, `same` remains 1, and `minn` is set to 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `num = ar[i]` updates the value of `num` to the element at index `i` in the list `ar`.
- Since `i` was updated to 4 in the initial state, `num` is now `ar[3]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `ar` remain unchanged.
- `same` remains 1, and `minn` is set to 1 as per the initial conditions.
