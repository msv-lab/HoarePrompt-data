Output State: **`n`, `k`, `ps`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb`, and `vis` remain unchanged. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `pb` is unchanged. `pathb` now includes the element `a[pb - 1]` appended to it.**

In natural language: The variables `n`, `k`, `ps`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb`, and `vis` remain the same as they were in the initial state. If the value of `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, then `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `vis[pb - 1]` is not 1, `pb` remains unchanged. In either case, the element `a[pb - 1]` is appended to the list `pathb`.
