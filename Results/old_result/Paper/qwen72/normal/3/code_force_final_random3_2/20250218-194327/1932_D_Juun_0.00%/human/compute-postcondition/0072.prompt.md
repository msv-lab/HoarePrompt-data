Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The `trumps` list is now empty, and all elements that were in `trumps` have been printed in pairs, each followed by the `trump` suit. The `answers` list remains unchanged, containing the strings formed by joining the sorted ranks of pairs of cards from `user_input` that have the same suit but are not the trump suit, and each string is in the format 'rank suit trumps.pop() trump' for each non-None rank in `suits` that had a corresponding trump card. The values of `n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, `user_input`, and `trump` remain unchanged, and the `suits` dictionary also remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `trumps` list is now empty, `answers` list must have at least one element, all other variables (`n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, `user_input`, and `suits`) remain unchanged

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `trumps` list is now empty, `answers` list must have at least one element, `answer` is the first element in the `answers` list, all other variables (`n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, `user_input`, and `suits`) remain unchanged

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `trumps` list is now empty, `answers` list must have at least two elements, `answer` is the second element in the `answers` list, all other variables (`n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, `user_input`, and `suits`) remain unchanged




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
