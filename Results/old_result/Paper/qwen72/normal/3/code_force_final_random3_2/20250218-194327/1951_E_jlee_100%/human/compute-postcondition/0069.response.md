Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, and `string` must have at least 1 character.
   - `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - `count2` is 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `done` remains False.
   - `count` is greater than 0.
   - The current character `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
   - `count2` is greater than `count`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement is simply printing the integer `2`.
   - The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this print statement because the statement does not reference any of them.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the print statement will be the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
