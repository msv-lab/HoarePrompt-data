The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j`, `n`, and `r`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `n + r + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and the condition `j <= n + r` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. The condition `j <= n + r` must still hold true, so `n + r` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`j` is 3, and the condition `j <= n + r` must still hold true for the loop to execute again. If `j <= n`, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state also remains unchanged.**
