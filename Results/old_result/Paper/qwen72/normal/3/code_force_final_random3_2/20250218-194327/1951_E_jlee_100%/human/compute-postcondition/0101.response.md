Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 1, `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is 0, `done` remains False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables, so the initial state remains unchanged.
