Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is `n-1`, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is `n`, `_` is incremented by 1, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. If the length of `aa` is 1, then the program retains all these conditions.**

The code snippet `ans = n` assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ans`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this assignment while retaining all the initial conditions.
