Output State: **`n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `preb`, `resb`, and `vis` remain unchanged except that `vis[ps - 1]` is now 1, and `paths` now includes the elements `a[ps - 1]`, `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, and `a[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]` at the end. `ps` is now equal to `p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`. If `vis[ps - 1]` was already 1 at any point during the loop execution, the loop is broken out of. `ress` and `resb` are now 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `resb, ress = 0, 0` sets both `ress` and `resb` to 0. All other variables and conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
