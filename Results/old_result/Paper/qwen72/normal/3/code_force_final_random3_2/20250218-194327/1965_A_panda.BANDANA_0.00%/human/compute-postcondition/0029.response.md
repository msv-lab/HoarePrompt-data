Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input (stdin). Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function checks if the number `1` is present in the list of integers. If `1` is found, it prints 'Bob' to standard output (stdout); otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program includes the processed test cases and the corresponding output for each. **
