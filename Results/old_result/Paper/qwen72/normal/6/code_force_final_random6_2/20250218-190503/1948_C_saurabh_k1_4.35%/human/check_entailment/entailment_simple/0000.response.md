Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the second-to-last cell in the second row (`b[n - 2]`) contains an arrow pointing to the left (`'<'`). If it does, the program immediately concludes that the robot cannot reach the cell `(2, n)` and prints "No". Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider the full dynamics of the robot's movement. The robot can move in four directions (left, right, up, down) and then follow the arrow in the current cell. The program's logic only checks a single condition, which is insufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.

To correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`, the program should simulate the robot's movement from the starting cell `(1, 1)` to the target cell `(2, n)`. This involves tracking the robot's position and following the rules for movement as described in the problem statement.

The provided program does not simulate the robot's movement, and the condition `b[n - 2] == '<'` is not a sufficient condition to determine the robot's ability to reach the target cell. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
