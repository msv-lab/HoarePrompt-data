Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. However, it calls `func_1()` without passing the necessary arguments (`x` and `y`).

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined without parameters, which means it cannot accept the values of `x` and `y` for each test case. This is a significant issue because the function needs to operate on these values.

3. **Swapping Logic**: The logic inside `func_1()` attempts to maximize the product by swapping digits. However, the logic is flawed:
   - For the first half of the digits, it swaps the minimum and maximum digits, which is incorrect. To maximize the product, you should aim to have the larger digits in the higher place values (leftmost positions) of both numbers.
   - For the second half of the digits, it again swaps the minimum and maximum digits, which is also incorrect for the same reason.

4. **Output**: The program correctly prints the modified values of `a` and `b` after the operations, but due to the flawed logic, the output will not maximize the product.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where `x` and `y` are single-digit numbers or where the digits are already maximized (e.g., `x = 99` and `y = 88`).

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
