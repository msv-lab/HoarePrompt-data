Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an input integer minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(i+1)} - 1\), and `mx` is the maximum of the previous `mx` and `i`.**

Explanation:
- The code `i = 0` sets the variable `i` to 0.
- The initial condition that `x` is an input integer minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(i+1)} - 1\) remains valid, but now `i` is 0, so `x` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(0+1)} - 1 = 1\).
- The initial condition that `mx` is the maximum of the previous `mx` and `i` remains valid, but now `i` is 0, so `mx` is the maximum of the previous `mx` and 0.
