Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 0 <= t <= 49, `n` is an integer input by the user for the current test case and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n`**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains the same as it was initially (an integer between 0 and 49, inclusive). The value of `n` also remains the same as it was input by the user for the current test case (an integer between 2 and 10^3, inclusive). The loop variable `i` will have reached the value of `n`, which is the last integer in the range from 1 to `n`.
