### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires distributing coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`.

2. **Mathematical Approach:**
   - We need to find `x_i` such that `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.
   - This can be rewritten as `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`, which simplifies to `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.
   - To ensure this, we can use the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i` to find a common base for the bets. However, the LCM approach alone is not sufficient to guarantee the condition `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

3. **Function 1:**
   - `func_1(a, b)` computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - The LCM is calculated using the formula `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) // GCD(a, b)`.

4. **Function 2:**
   - `func_2()` processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
   - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier and then iteratively computes the LCM of `den` and each multiplier in `vals`.
   - After computing the LCM, it calculates the bet for each outcome as `den // k_i`.
   - It then checks if the total amount bet `sum(vprod)` is less than `den`. If not, it prints `-1`.
   - Finally, it prints the bets for each outcome.

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The LCM approach ensures that `den` is a common multiple of all `k_i` values, but it does not necessarily ensure that `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.
   - The condition `sum(x_i) < den` is used to check if the total amount bet is less than the LCM, but this is not the correct condition to ensure that `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.
   - The correct condition should be `sum(x_i) < x_i * k_i` for all `i`, which simplifies to `sum(x_i) < den / k_i * k_i` for all `i`, or `sum(x_i) < den` for all `i`.

6. **Flaws in the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment assumes that the LCM approach alone is sufficient to ensure the condition `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`, which is not always true.
   - The program may fail in cases where the LCM is too large, causing the total amount bet to exceed the amount received back for some outcomes.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - `N = 3`, `vals = [3, 2, 7]`
  - `den` is computed as the LCM of 3, 2, and 7, which is 42.
  - `vprod = [42 // 3, 42 // 2, 42 // 7] = [14, 21, 6]`
  - `sum(vprod) = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41`
  - `41 < 42` is true, so the program prints `14 21 6`.
  - This is incorrect because `14 * 3 = 42`, `21 * 2 = 42`, and `6 * 7 = 42`, which means the total amount bet is not strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `N = 2`, `vals = [3, 3]`
  - `den` is computed as the LCM of 3 and 3, which is 3.
  - `vprod = [3 // 3, 3 // 3] = [1, 1]`
  - `sum(vprod) = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - `2 < 3` is true, so the program prints `1 1`.
  - This is correct because `1 * 3 = 3` and `1 * 3 = 3`, and the total amount bet is 2, which is less than 3.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `N = 5`, `vals = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
  - `den` is computed as the LCM of 5, 5, 5, 5, and 5, which is 5.
  - `vprod = [5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - `sum(vprod) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`
  - `5 <= 5` is true, so the program prints `-1`.
  - This is correct because the total amount bet is equal to the amount received back for any winning outcome, which violates the condition.

### Conclusion:
The program does not always correctly distribute the coins to ensure that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The LCM approach is not sufficient to guarantee the required condition in all cases.

Final: **False**
