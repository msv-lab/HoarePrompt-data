Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list if the last element of `arr` is negative, otherwise it is `[sum of all non-negative elements from the last segment, index of the last non-negative element]`. `max_segment` is `[sum of the maximum segment of non-negative elements, starting index of the maximum segment]`. `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a segment of non-negative elements, the starting index of the segment, and the ending index of the segment.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be the last index of `arr`, which is `len(arr) - 1`.
- **`max_sum`**: The variable `max_sum` remains unchanged at -1 because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`new_segment`**: If the last element of `arr` is negative, `new_segment` will be an empty list. If the last element is non-negative, `new_segment` will be a list containing the sum of all non-negative elements in the current segment and the index of the last non-negative element in that segment.
- **`max_segment`**: This variable will contain the sum of the maximum segment of non-negative elements found in `arr` and the starting index of that segment.
- **`segments_variants`**: This list will contain all the segments of non-negative elements that were considered during the loop. Each segment is represented as a list with three elements: the sum of the segment, the starting index of the segment, and the ending index of the segment.
