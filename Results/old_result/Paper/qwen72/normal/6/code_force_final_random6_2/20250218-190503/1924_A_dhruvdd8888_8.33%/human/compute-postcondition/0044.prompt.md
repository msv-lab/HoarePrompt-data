Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, and it is now updated to the user input string. `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. `win` is an empty set. `ans` is a list containing the characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach a size of `k` and then cleared `win`. `ps` is the number of times `win` reached a size of `k` and was cleared, and `ps` is less than `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in us:
    if i not in win:
        print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach a size of `k` and then cleared `win`, `ps` is the number of times `win` reached a size of `k` and was cleared, and `ps` is less than `n`. If `i` is not in `win`, `i` is the first element in `us` and `i` is not in `win`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach a size of `k` and then cleared `win`, `ps` is the number of times `win` reached a size of `k` and was cleared, and `ps` is less than `n`. If `i` is not in `win`, `i` is the next element in `us` and `i` is not in `win`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets, `win` is a set that may or may not contain `i` from the previous iteration, `ans` is a list containing the characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach a size of `k` and then cleared `win`, `ps` is the number of times `win` reached a size of `k` and was cleared, and `ps` is less than `n`. If `i` is not in `win`, `i` is the next element in `us` that is not in `win`, and `us` must still have elements that have not been iterated over.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
