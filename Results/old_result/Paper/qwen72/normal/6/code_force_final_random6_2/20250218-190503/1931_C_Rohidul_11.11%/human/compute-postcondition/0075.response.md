To determine whether the loop can execute, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop head: `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `l` (left index)
   - `r` (right index)
   - `a` (list of integers)

2. **Initial State:**
   - `l` is 0
   - `r` is `n - 1`
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by user input

3. **Condition Breakdown:**
   - `l < r`: This condition will be true if `l` is less than `r`. Given that `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`, this condition will be true if `n > 1`.
   - `a[l] == a[l + 1]`: This condition will be true if the first element of the list `a` is equal to the second element of the list `a`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`, the condition `l < r` will be true if `n > 1`. Given that `n` is an input integer greater than 1, this condition is already satisfied.
   - The condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]` needs to be true for the loop to execute. This means that the first element of the list `a` must be equal to the second element of the list `a`.

### Conclusion:
The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `a[0] == a[1]` for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 0, `end` is 0, `ans` is 0 if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if both `st` and `end` are 0, otherwise `ans` is 0 and either `st` is not 0 or `end` is not 0, and `a[0] == a[1]`**
