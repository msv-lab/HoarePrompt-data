Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If `arr[i] == val`, `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is set to 0. `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`. `cnt` is 0.** 

In natural language: The initial state remains the same, but the variable `cnt` is reset to 0.
