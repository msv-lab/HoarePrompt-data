You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is incremented by `t`, `n` is the final input integer, `s1` is the final input string, `s2` is the final input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in the final `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in the final `s2`, `i` is `n-1`, `hd` is the final value of `a1 - a2` after all iterations, and `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` where `hd` was not greater than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads two integers `t` and `n`, and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1'. It calculates the Hamming distance (number of differing positions) between `s1` and `s2` with a specific adjustment: if the number of '1's in `s1` is greater than in `s2`, it reduces the Hamming distance by the difference in the number of '1's. Otherwise, it increments the Hamming distance for each position where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0'. The function prints the adjusted Hamming distance for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given an initial state `s1` and a desired state `s2` of `n` boxes, where each box can either contain a cat ('1') or be empty ('0').
   - We need to determine the minimum number of operations required to transform `s1` into `s2`.
   - The operations allowed are:
     - Adding a cat to an empty box.
     - Removing a cat from a box.
     - Moving a cat from one box to another.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The number of '1's in `s1` and `s2` will determine the number of cats that need to be added or removed.
   - If the number of '1's in `s1` is greater than the number of '1's in `s2`, we need to remove cats.
   - If the number of '1's in `s1` is less than the number of '1's in `s2`, we need to add cats.
   - If the number of '1's in `s1` is equal to the number of '1's in `s2`, we need to move cats to the correct positions.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - Calculate the number of '1's in `s1` (`a1`) and `s2` (`a2`).
   - The difference `hd = a1 - a2` will tell us the net number of cats to be added or removed.
   - The absolute value of `hd` (`res = abs(a1 - a2)`) will be the initial number of operations required to balance the number of cats.
   - After balancing the number of cats, we need to move the remaining cats to their correct positions. This is done by iterating through the boxes and counting the number of '1's in `s1` that need to be moved to a '0' in `s2`.

4. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `s1`, and `s2`.
   - It counts the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2` and calculates the initial number of operations `res` as the absolute difference between these counts.
   - It then iterates through the boxes and increments `res` for each '1' in `s1` that needs to be moved to a '0' in `s2`, but only after the number of extra cats (`hd`) has been handled.
   - Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `s1` and `s2` are identical, the number of operations required is 0.
   - If `s1` has more '1's than `s2`, the extra '1's need to be removed.
   - If `s1` has fewer '1's than `s2`, the missing '1's need to be added.
   - If the number of '1's is the same but the positions are different, the cats need to be moved.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The code correctly handles the addition, removal, and movement of cats.
   - The logic for counting the number of operations is sound and matches the problem requirements.
