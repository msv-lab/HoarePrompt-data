Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list containing elements from `a` based on certain conditions, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers. If `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `r[a[i] - 1]` is now 0, `ur` is 2, and `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`. Otherwise, `ur` remains 0, and `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`. In both cases, `i` is `n`, `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` (from the first `n` elements) that were equal to 2 in `l` and were reset to 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and `ul` is equal to `ur`.**
