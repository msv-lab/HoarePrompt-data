### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second element to the last element.
   - The beauty can be maximized by sorting the array in ascending order, as this will ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, and the sum of these differences will be maximized.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array `a` itself.
   - It then checks if the array is already in a non-decreasing order using the function `func_1`.
   - If the array is already in non-decreasing order, it prints `0` because no rearrangement can increase the beauty.
   - Otherwise, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` is in non-decreasing order.
   - It iterates through the array and counts the number of times an element is greater than or equal to the next element.
   - If the count `order` is `0`, it returns `True` (indicating the array is already in non-decreasing order).
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Beauty Calculation:**
   - If the array is not in non-decreasing order, the program sorts the array.
   - It then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - This approach is correct because sorting the array in ascending order will maximize the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the array is already in non-decreasing order by printing `0`.
   - It also handles the case where all elements are the same (e.g., `[69, 69, 69]`), which results in a beauty of `0`.

6. **Input and Output:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It prints the correct output for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the problem description accurately. It handles all edge cases and ensures the maximum beauty of the array is calculated correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
