Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **_** is 1 (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
2. **t** is greater than 0 (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
3. **l1** is a list of strings obtained from the input.
4. **n** is the integer value of the first element in **l1**.
5. **k** is 1 (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
6. **k0** is the integer value of the second element in **l1**.
7. **i** is 0 (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
8. **arr** is [0, 1] (This list is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
9. **c** is 3 (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
10. **ans** is [2, 2, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0] where the number of zeros appended is `n - len(ans)`.

Given the initial state, we need to determine the value of **ans** before the print statement is executed.

- **ans** starts as [2, 2, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0].
- The number of zeros appended to **ans** is determined by `n - len(ans)`, where `n` is the integer value of the first element in **l1** and `len(ans)` is the initial length of **ans**.

Let's assume the input list **l1** is ["5", "3"]. This means:
- **n** is 5 (the integer value of the first element in **l1**).
- The initial length of **ans** is 3 (since **ans** is [2, 2, 1]).

To find the number of zeros to append:
- `n - len(ans) = 5 - 3 = 2`.

So, **ans** will be [2, 2, 1, 0, 0].

Now, the print statement `print(*ans)` will print the elements of **ans** separated by spaces.

Output: **2 2 1 0 0**
