Reasoning:

1. **Case when \( k = n \)**:
   - If \( k = n \), it means all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. This can only happen if all elements in the array are the same. The program correctly handles this by creating an array of `n` ones, which is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of this array will be `[1, 1, ..., 1]`, and they are all sorted.

2. **Case when \( k = 1 \)**:
   - If \( k = 1 \), it means exactly one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. The program creates an array using `range(n)`, which generates a sequence of integers from 0 to \( n-1 \). This sequence is sorted, and when cyclically shifted, only the original sequence remains sorted. For example, for \( n = 3 \), the array is `[0, 1, 2]`, and its cyclic shifts are `[0, 1, 2]`, `[1, 2, 0]`, and `[2, 0, 1]`. Only `[0, 1, 2]` is sorted. This is a valid solution.

3. **Case when \( k \neq 1 \) and \( k \neq n \)**:
   - The program prints `-1` in this case. This is correct because for \( k \neq 1 \) and \( k \neq n \), it is impossible to construct an array such that exactly \( k \) cyclic shifts are sorted. For example, if \( k = 2 \) and \( n = 3 \), no array can have exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts. The only valid cases are when \( k = 1 \) or \( k = n \).

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly handles all the specified cases and outputs the correct results based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
