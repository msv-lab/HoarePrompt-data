Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that sums up to a given integer `n`, where `n` is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet. The positions range from 1 to 26.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.

3. **Alphabet Initialization**: The program initializes the alphabet using `string.ascii_lowercase`, which is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'. This is correct and necessary for mapping the positions to letters.

4. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: `n > 52`**:
     - The program adds the letter corresponding to `n - 53` to the word, followed by 'zz'.
     - This is correct because the maximum sum of the positions of two letters is 52 (26 + 26), so if `n` is greater than 52, the first letter must be at least 'b' (index 2) to allow the remaining two letters to be 'z' (index 26).

   - **Case 2: `n > 27`**:
     - The program adds 'a' to the word, followed by the letter corresponding to `n - 28`, and then 'z'.
     - This is incorrect. The logic here is flawed. The correct approach should be to find the largest possible second letter such that the sum of the first and second letters is as close to `n` as possible, and then the third letter should be the smallest possible letter to make up the remaining sum. For example, if `n` is 50, the correct word should be 'ayz' (1 + 25 + 24), not 'aaz' (1 + 22 + 27).

   - **Case 3: `n == 27`**:
     - The program sets the word to 'aay'.
     - This is correct because the only way to get a sum of 27 with three letters is 'a' (index 1), 'a' (index 1), and 'y' (index 25).

   - **Case 4: `n <= 26`**:
     - The program adds 'aa' to the word, followed by the letter corresponding to `n - 3`.
     - This is correct because the sum of the positions of 'a' and 'a' is 2, so the remaining sum is `n - 2`. The third letter is chosen to be the letter corresponding to `n - 3`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the constructed word for each test case. However, due to the incorrect logic in the second case, the output for some test cases will be incorrect.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 3 correctly by outputting 'aaa'.
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 78 correctly by outputting 'zzz'.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `28 <= n <= 52` correctly. The logic for this case needs to be revised to ensure the lexicographically smallest word is generated.

Final: **False**
