Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 0.** 

The variable `i` is assigned the value 0. The list `arr` remains unchanged, with its length and element values still satisfying the initial conditions.
