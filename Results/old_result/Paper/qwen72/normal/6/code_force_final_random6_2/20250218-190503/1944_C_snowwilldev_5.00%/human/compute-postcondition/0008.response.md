The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `N` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2, and `N` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is 2, `N` must be greater than 2, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[a[1]]` is incremented by 1**
