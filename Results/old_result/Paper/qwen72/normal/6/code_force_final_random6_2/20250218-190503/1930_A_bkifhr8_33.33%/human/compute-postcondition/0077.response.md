Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `t` must be greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list that includes the final value of `ans`, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` added to the initial `ans` value (which was 0), and if the length of `lst` is not 2, the first and third elements of `lst` have been removed.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `n` remains an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50.
- The condition that `t` must be greater than `n * 2 + 1` remains valid.
- The list `ans_f` still includes the final value of `ans`.
- The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` (converted to integers) added to the initial `ans` value (which was 0).
- If the length of `lst` is not 2, the first and third elements of `lst` have been removed. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `lst` remains unchanged.
