You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 0 <= arr[i] < 2^30 for all i, and x is an integer where 0 <= x < 2^30.
def func_1(arr, x):
    return find_max(arr, 31)
    #The program returns the maximum integer value from the list 'arr', where all integers in 'arr' are between 0 and 2^30 - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `x`, but it does not use `x` in its execution. It returns the maximum integer value from the list `arr`, where all integers in `arr` are between 0 and 2^30 - 1. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the maximum value from `arr` is returned, and `x` remains unchanged.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30.
def find_max(cur_arr, bit):

If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, then `thing1` is -1. Otherwise, if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, then `thing1` is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`.
    if (x >> bit & 1) :
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))

        #The program returns -1 or the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`, depending on whether the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1 or 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `find_max` accepts a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` (0 <= bit < 30). It returns the number of elements in `cur_arr` if `bit` is -1. Otherwise, it processes the list to create a new list `new_arr` containing the XOR of elements in `cur_arr` that have a 0 at the `bit` position. If the bit at position `bit` in the final `xor` value is 1, it returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`. If the bit at position `bit` in the final `xor` value is 0, it returns -1 or the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`, depending on the bit at position `bit` in `xor`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation of the incorrectness:**

The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, the function `func_1` calls `find_max` with a fixed bit length of 31, which does not take into account the value of `x` or the bitwise operations required to ensure the result is within the limit of `x`.

The problem description requires that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of the selected segments should be less than or equal to `x`. The function `find_max` is designed to recursively split the array based on the highest bit, but it does not consider the value of `x` in its logic. This can lead to incorrect results in cases where the highest bit of `x` is not the highest bit of the array elements.

**Example of incorrect behavior:**

Consider the following input:
```
1
3 1
1 2 3
```

The expected output is `2`, as explained in the problem description. However, the provided program will not correctly handle this case because it does not consider the value of `x` in its splitting logic. The function `find_max` will split the array based on the highest bit (31), which is not relevant to the value of `x` (1).

To fix this, the program should consider the value of `x` and ensure that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of the segments does not exceed `x`. The current implementation does not do this, leading to potential incorrect results.
