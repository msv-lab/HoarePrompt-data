Output State: **`i` is increased by the number of consecutive duplicate elements starting from the initial `i`, `i` is less than or equal to `j`, and `arr[i]` is either not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or `i` is greater than `j`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have been incremented by the number of consecutive duplicate elements found starting from its initial value. The loop will stop either because `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]` or because `i` has become greater than `j`. The variable `j` remains unchanged, and the list `arr` is not modified.
