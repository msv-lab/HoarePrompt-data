Postcondition: ***`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 1, `arr` is [0, 1], `c` is 1. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` is [2, `k0` - 2], and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains [2].***
