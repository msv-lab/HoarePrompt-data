Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `n + 2`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, where each element `v[i]` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the first `n` elements of `data` starting from index 2, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is updated to `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`, and `i` is 0. The current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` to it.
- The value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, so the expression `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` calculates the number of combinations of 3 elements from `v[i]` occurrences.
- All other variables (`t`, `data`, `idx`, `results`, `n`, `v`, `cnt`, `i`) remain unchanged.
