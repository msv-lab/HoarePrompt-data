Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended twice, `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().strip()` updates the value of `a` by taking a new input from the user and removing any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `t`, `results`, `n`, `b`, `c`, and `_` remain unchanged, and the condition that `t` must be greater than the new value of `_` still holds.
