The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is specified to be equal to `t`. The value of `_` remains unchanged. The precondition that `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 is still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`.
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`.**
