### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input from standard input, processes it, and splits it into a list of integers. It then iterates over the test cases, extracting the necessary values for each test case.

2. **Calculating Scores:**
   - The function `calculate_score` is responsible for calculating the score for a player starting from a given position. It uses a loop to simulate the game turns and a dictionary to detect cycles in the permutation.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining turns by leveraging the cycle length and the score accumulated within the cycle.

3. **Determining the Winner:**
   - The function `func_1` calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha, compares their scores, and returns the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

4. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The `calculate_score` function correctly detects cycles using a dictionary to track visited positions and their corresponding steps. This is crucial for efficiently handling large values of `k`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is very large and when the permutation contains cycles. It correctly updates the score for the remaining turns after a cycle is detected.

6. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case after processing all of them.

### Correctness:
- The program appears to correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game" as described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output formats correctly, and the cycle detection and score calculation logic is sound.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
