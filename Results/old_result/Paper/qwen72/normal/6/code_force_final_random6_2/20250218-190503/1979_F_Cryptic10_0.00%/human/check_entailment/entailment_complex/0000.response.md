Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves finding a Hamiltonian path in a modified complete graph where exactly \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed. The graph is guaranteed to have a Hamiltonian path, and we can make at most \( n \) queries to determine this path.

2. **Interaction Protocol**:
   - We can ask a query `"? d"` to get the vertex \( v \) with the minimum degree at least \( d \) and another vertex \( u \) that is not connected to \( v \) (if such a vertex exists).
   - The response to the query is a pair of integers \( (v, u) \).
   - If \( v \) is 0, it means no vertex with the required degree exists.
   - If \( u \) is 0, it means \( v \) is connected to all remaining vertices.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function sends a query to the interactor and reads the response. It is used to interact with the problem's constraints and is correctly implemented.
   - **func_2**: This function constructs the Hamiltonian path by repeatedly querying the interactor with decreasing values of \( d \) (from \( n-1 \) to 0). It adds the vertex \( v \) to the path and removes it from the set of remaining vertices. The loop continues until all vertices are added to the path.

4. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - The algorithm starts with all vertices in the `remaining_vertices` set.
   - It iterates over possible degrees \( d \) from \( n-1 \) to 0.
   - For each \( d \), it queries the interactor to find a vertex \( v \) with the minimum degree at least \( d \) and another vertex \( u \) not connected to \( v \).
   - If \( v \) is found and is in the `remaining_vertices` set, it is added to the path and removed from the set.
   - This process continues until all vertices are added to the path.
   - Finally, the path is printed in the required format.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The algorithm ensures that each vertex is added to the path exactly once and removed from the set of remaining vertices.
   - The loop will terminate when all vertices are added to the path, as `remaining_vertices` will become an empty set.
   - The path is constructed by selecting vertices in a way that ensures a Hamiltonian path is formed, given the constraints of the problem.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( n = 2 \), the graph is simply a single edge between two vertices. The algorithm will correctly identify this and print the path.
   - For larger \( n \), the algorithm will handle the removal of vertices and the construction of the path as described.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem by following the interaction protocol and ensuring that a Hamiltonian path is found within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
