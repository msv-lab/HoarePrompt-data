Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the user. It then modifies the list `a` by incrementing each element by its index plus one. After this, it removes duplicates from `a`, sorts the list in descending order, and constructs a new list `ans` that contains all unique elements from `a` and additional elements to ensure the total length of `ans` is `n`. The additional elements are chosen to fill the gaps between consecutive elements in the sorted list `a` and are decremented by 1 from the last element of `a` if necessary. Finally, the function prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. The function does not return any value. **
