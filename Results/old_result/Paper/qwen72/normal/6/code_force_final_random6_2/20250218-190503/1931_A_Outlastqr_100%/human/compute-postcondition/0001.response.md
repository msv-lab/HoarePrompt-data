The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since the function is expected to take an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, we can assume that `int(input())` is equivalent to `t`. Therefore, `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
