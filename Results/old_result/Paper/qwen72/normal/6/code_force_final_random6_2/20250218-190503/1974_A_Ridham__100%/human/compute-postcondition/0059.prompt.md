You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, x and y, where x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        space_x = x * 1
        
        space_y = y * 4
        
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if extra_space % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
        
    #State: `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is an input integer, `result` is a list containing the number of screens required for each iteration of the loop, where the number of screens required for each iteration is calculated as follows: If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`, and if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`. The remaining cells on the screen are calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`. If `space_x` (which is `x`) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, the number of screens required for that iteration is `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, the number of screens required is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is `x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0` or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: 5
    #8
    #10
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. The function returns a value based on the inputs, but the specific return conditions are not provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
