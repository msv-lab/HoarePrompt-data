The code snippet `last = int(word[len(word) - 1])` converts the last character of the string `word` to an integer and assigns it to the variable `last`.

Given the initial state:
- `word` is '11'
- `last` is 0

The last character of `word` is '1'. Converting '1' to an integer results in 1. Therefore, `last` is updated to 1.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged:
- `total` is 45
- `i` is 11
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 11
- `values` is a list of integers with the specified values
- `sum_values` is a list of integers with the specified values
- `values[10]` is `values[0] + values[1]`
- `sum_values[10]` is `values[10] + sum_values[9]`
- `remainder` is 1

Output State: **`total` is 45, `i` is 11, `n` must be greater than or equal to 11, `values` is a list of integers with the specified values, `sum_values` is a list of integers with the specified values, `word` is '11', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 1, `values[10]` is `values[0] + values[1]`, `sum_values[10]` is `values[10] + sum_values[9]`**
