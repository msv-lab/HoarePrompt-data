Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic implemented in the program only checks if the second-to-last cell in the bottom row (i.e., `b[n - 2]`) contains a left arrow (`<`). If it does, the program prints `No`, otherwise it prints `Yes`.

This logic is flawed because it does not consider the full path the robot can take. The robot can move in multiple directions and can be influenced by the arrows in both the top and bottom rows. The program needs to simulate the robot's movement from the starting cell `(1, 1)` to the target cell `(2, n)` to determine if it can reach the target.

Here is a corrected version of the program that simulates the robot's movement:

```python
def can_reach_end(n, a, b):
    # Initialize the robot's starting position
    row, col = 1, 1
    
    # Set to keep track of visited cells to avoid infinite loops
    visited = set()
    visited.add((1, 1))
    
    while True:
        # Determine the next move based on the current position
        if row == 1:
            if a[col - 1] == '>':
                col += 1
            else:
                row = 2
        else:  # row == 2
            if b[col - 1] == '>':
                col += 1
            else:
                row = 1
        
        # Check if the robot has reached the target cell
        if (row, col) == (2, n):
            return 'Yes'
        
        # Check if the robot has moved out of bounds or into a visited cell
        if col > n or (row, col) in visited:
            return 'No'
        
        # Mark the current cell as visited
        visited.add((row, col))

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        print(can_reach_end(n, a, b))

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected version of the program simulates the robot's movement and checks if it can reach the target cell `(2, n)`. It uses a set to keep track of visited cells to avoid infinite loops. If the robot reaches the target cell, it prints `Yes`. If the robot moves out of bounds or into a visited cell, it prints `No`.
