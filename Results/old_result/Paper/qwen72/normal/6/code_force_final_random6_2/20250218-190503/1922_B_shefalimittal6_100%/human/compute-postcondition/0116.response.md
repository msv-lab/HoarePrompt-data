Output State: **`_` is `n - 1`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + n`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1, `v` contains the counts of the values from `data` that were indexed from `idx` to `idx + n - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`, `ans` is `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, `n` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, and if `v[i]` is at least 3, `ans` is `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `v[i]` remains at least 2 and `ans` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` updates the value of `ans` by adding the result of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to the current value of `ans`.
- The other variables (`_`, `x`, `idx`, `v[x]`, `v`, `cnt`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for `ans` being updated based on `v[i]` being at least 3 or remaining 0 if `v[i]` is at least 2 still holds true.
