The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.**
