The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes to `n + 1`). Before the loop starts, `i` should be 1, which is the first value it will take in the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 0 <= t <= 49, `n` is an integer input by the user for the current test case and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1**
