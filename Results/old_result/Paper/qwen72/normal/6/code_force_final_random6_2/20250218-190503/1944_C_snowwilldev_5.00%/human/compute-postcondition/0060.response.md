Output State: **`N` remains the same and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`. If `cnt[0]` is 1, then `t` is 3; otherwise, `t` is 2. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
