Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is equal to `t`.
- `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `cp` is 0.
- `i` is `len(b) - 1`.
- `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where each element is less than or equal to the next element.
- `b` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where each element is less than or equal to the next element.
- `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity.
- `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity.
- `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than the previous element in `a` for all valid indices from 1 to `len(a) - 1` plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element in `b` for all valid indices from 1 to `len(b) - 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Lists `a` and `b`**:
   - Both `a` and `b` are lists of integers where each element is less than or equal to the next element. This means both lists are non-decreasing.
   - For a non-decreasing list, no element is greater than the previous element. Therefore, the number of times an element in `a` is greater than the previous element is 0, and the same applies to `b`.

2. **Variable `s`**:
   - `s` is calculated as the sum of the number of times an element in `a` is greater than the previous element and the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element.
   - Since both `a` and `b` are non-decreasing, the number of times an element is greater than the previous element in each list is 0.
   - Therefore, `s` is \(0 + 0 = 0\).

### Conclusion:
The `print(s)` statement will print the value of `s`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
