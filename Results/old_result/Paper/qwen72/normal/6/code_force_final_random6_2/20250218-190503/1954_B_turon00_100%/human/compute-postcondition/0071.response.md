The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the first element of `a` is not equal to `tmp`. Since the code does not affect `n`, `i`, or the elements of `a`, these conditions remain unchanged. However, the value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `a` is not equal to `tmp`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.**
