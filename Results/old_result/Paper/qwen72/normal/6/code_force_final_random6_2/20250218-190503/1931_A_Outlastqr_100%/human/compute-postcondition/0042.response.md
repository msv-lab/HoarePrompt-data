Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) from the input, decodes `n` into a string `word` based on specific rules, and prints the decoded string. The rules for decoding are as follows: if `n` > 52, `word` is the character at index `n - 53` in the lowercase English alphabet concatenated with 'zz'; if `n` > 27 and `n` ≤ 52, `word` is 'a' followed by the character at index `n - 28` in the alphabet and then 'z'; if `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'; if `n` < 27, `word` is 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3` in the alphabet. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. **
