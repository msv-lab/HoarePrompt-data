Output State: **`t` is an input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of the character 'L' in the string `t`, `i` is `n - 4`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where the last element and the element at index `n - 3` are the updated value of `k`, and all other elements are 0, except `y[i]` which is now `k`. If `t[i]` is 'R', `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`, and `q2` is `l + 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 3`. If `t[i]` is not 'R', `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`, and `q1` is `q1 - 1`.**
