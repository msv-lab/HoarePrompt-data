Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is `L[0]`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `q` is updated to the ceiling of `k / m`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values.
- The ceiling function ensures that `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the result of `k / m`.
