Precondition: **n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept the number of test cases, the size of the chessboard, the number of moves already played, and the moves themselves. Here is a more appropriate function definition and precondition:

Function definition:
```
def count_final_configurations(t, test_cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and test_cases is a list of tuples, each containing n, k, and a list of k moves. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, k is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and each move is a tuple (r_i, c_i) where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and no two moves share the same row or column.**
