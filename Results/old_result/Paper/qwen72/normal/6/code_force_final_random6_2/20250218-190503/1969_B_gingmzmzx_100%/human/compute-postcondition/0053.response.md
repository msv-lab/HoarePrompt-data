Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is 0, `ans` is 0.**

The code snippet `ans = 0` resets the value of `ans` to 0. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `zeroes`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and conditions.
