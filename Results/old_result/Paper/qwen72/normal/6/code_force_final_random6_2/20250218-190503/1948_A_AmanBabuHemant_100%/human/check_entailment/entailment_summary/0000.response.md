Reasoning:

1. **Odd `n` Handling**: The program correctly identifies that if `n` is odd, it is impossible to construct a string with exactly `n` special characters because each special character must be part of a pair (either `AA` or `BB`). Since the special characters come in pairs, `n` must be even. The program prints 'NO' for odd `n`, which is correct.

2. **Even `n` Handling**: For even `n`, the program constructs a string `s` by repeating the pattern 'AAB' `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each 'A' in the 'AAB' segment is a special character (since it is equal to its neighbor 'A'), and each 'B' is not a special character. Therefore, the constructed string will have exactly `n` special characters.

3. **String Length Check**: The program checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. If it is, the program prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. If the length is 200 or more, the program prints 'NO'. Given that `n` is at most 50, the maximum length of `s` is `50 * 3 = 150`, which is always less than 200. Therefore, the length check is redundant but does not affect the correctness of the program.

4. **Output Format**: The program follows the required output format. For each test case, it prints either 'NO' or 'YES' followed by the constructed string.

5. **Test Cases**: The program correctly handles the provided test cases:
   - For `n = 6`, the output is 'YES' followed by 'AAABAAB', which has exactly 6 special characters.
   - For `n = 1`, the output is 'NO' because 1 is odd.
   - For `n = 2`, the output is 'YES' followed by 'AAB', which has exactly 2 special characters.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
