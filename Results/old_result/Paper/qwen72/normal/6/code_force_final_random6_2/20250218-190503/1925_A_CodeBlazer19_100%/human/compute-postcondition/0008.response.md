Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers.**

The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `n` and `k`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `t` is still greater than 2, `i` is still 2, and `n` and `k` now hold the values of the input integers.
