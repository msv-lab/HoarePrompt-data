The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, but based on the provided constraints and relationships, it should accept a binary string `s` and an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5. However, since the function definition is incomplete, we can only infer the intended functionality based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function is intended to accept a binary string `s` and an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. It should return the minimum cost required to sort the binary string `s` in non-decreasing order. If the function is called with invalid parameters, it should handle such cases appropriately.**
