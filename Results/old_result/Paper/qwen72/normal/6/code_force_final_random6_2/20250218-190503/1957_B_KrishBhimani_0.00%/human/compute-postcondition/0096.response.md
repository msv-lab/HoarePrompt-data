Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 0, `arr` is [0, 1], `c` is 3, `ans` is [2, 2, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0] (where the number of zeros appended is `n - len(ans)`).**

Explanation:
- The code `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` updates the values of `n` and `k` to the integer values of the first and second elements in `l1`, respectively.
- The value of `n` is now the integer value of the first element in `l1`.
- The value of `k` is now the integer value of the second element in `l1`.
- The value of `k0` is also the integer value of the second element in `l1`, so it remains unchanged.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `i`, `arr`, `c`, `ans`) are not affected by this code snippet and retain their initial values.
