Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are the integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers from the new input split by a space that must have at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `ele` is the first element of `l`, and `ele` is less than 0, and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`.**

The code `maxi = max(c, maxi)` does not change the value of `maxi` because both `c` and `maxi` are 0. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged.
