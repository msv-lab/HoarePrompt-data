Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is `[arr[1], 1]`, `max_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `max_segment` is updated to `[arr[0] + arr[1], 1]`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing a single element `[0, 0, -1]` if `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, otherwise `max_segment` is updated to be equal to `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [0].**

Explanation:
- `new_segment` is updated to `[arr[1], 1]`.
- The initial state of `max_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[0]`.
- If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` remains `[0, 0, -1]`.
- Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` is updated to `[arr[1], 1, 0]`.
