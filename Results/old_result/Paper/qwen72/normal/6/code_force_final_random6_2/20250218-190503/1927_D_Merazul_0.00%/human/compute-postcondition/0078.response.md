The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `k`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- If `u` is `False` and `v` is `True`, then `n` is decreased by 1.
- If `u` is `True` or `v` is `False`, then `n` remains unchanged.

However, the loop head does not involve `u`, `v`, or `n`. The loop head is `for i in range(1, k + 1)`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is the current value.
- `k` is the upper bound for the loop, and `i` must be less than or equal to `k` for the loop to execute again.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1.
- `k` must remain unchanged or be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` remains unchanged**
