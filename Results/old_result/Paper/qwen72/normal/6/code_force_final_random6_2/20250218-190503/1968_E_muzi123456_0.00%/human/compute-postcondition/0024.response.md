The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 48, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3**
