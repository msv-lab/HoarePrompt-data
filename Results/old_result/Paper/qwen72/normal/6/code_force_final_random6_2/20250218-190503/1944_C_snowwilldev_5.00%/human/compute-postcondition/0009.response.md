Output State: **`i` is 2, `N` must be greater than 2, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[a[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[a[2]]` is incremented by 1.** 

The value of `i` is 2, and the code increments `cnt[a[i]]` by 1. Since `i` is 2, `cnt[a[2]]` is incremented by 1. The other conditions remain unchanged.
