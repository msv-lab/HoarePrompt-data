### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.

2. **Operation Simulation**:
   - The program iterates through the array `list1` and checks if the current element is greater than the next element and if the current element is greater than 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it performs the operation of splitting the current element into its digits and inserting them back into the array at the correct positions.

3. **Sorting Check**:
   - After potentially performing the operations, the program calls `func_1` to check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The function `func_1` compares the original list `lst` with its sorted version `sorted_lst` and returns `True` if they are the same, indicating the list is sorted.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'Yes' if the array is sorted, otherwise it prints 'No'.

### Issues:
- **Inefficient Operation Simulation**:
  - The program only performs the operation once if it finds an element that is greater than the next element and greater than 10. This is incorrect because the operation might need to be performed multiple times to ensure the array can be sorted.
  - For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. The program will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`. However, it should continue to check if further operations are needed to ensure the array is sorted.

- **Incorrect Logic**:
  - The program does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted array. For instance, in the array `[12, 28, 5]`, the program will split `12` into `[1, 2]` but will not split `28` into `[2, 8]`, leading to an incorrect result.

### Correctness:
- **False**:
  - The program does not correctly simulate the operation multiple times as required by the problem statement.
  - The logic for checking if the array can be sorted is flawed and may produce incorrect results for certain test cases.

### Example:
- For the test case `[12, 28, 5]`, the program will only split `12` into `[1, 2]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 28, 5]`. It will then check if this array is sorted, which it is not, and incorrectly print 'NO'.
- The correct approach would be to split `12` into `[1, 2]` and then split `28` into `[2, 8]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`, which still needs further operations to become sorted.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
