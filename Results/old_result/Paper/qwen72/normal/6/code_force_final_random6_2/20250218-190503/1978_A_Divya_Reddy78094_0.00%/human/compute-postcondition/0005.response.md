Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, sorted in descending order.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(nums[0] + nums[1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order**:
   - This means the first element `nums[0]` is the largest integer in the list.
   - The second element `nums[1]` is the second largest integer in the list.

2. **`print(nums[0] + nums[1])`**:
   - The `print` statement will output the sum of the first and second elements of the `nums` list.
   - Since `nums` is sorted in descending order, `nums[0]` is the largest element and `nums[1]` is the second largest element.

### Final Output:
The code will print the sum of the largest and second largest integers in the `nums` list.
Output: **nums[0] + nums[1] (where nums[0] is the largest integer in the list and nums[1] is the second largest integer in the list)**
