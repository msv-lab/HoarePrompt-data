Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `T` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` and `k` are input integers.
   - `lst` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
   - `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element.
   - `sng` must be a non-empty list with at least one more element.
   - `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element.
   - `elem` is the next element in `sng` that will be processed.
   - The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` is incremented by 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement prints the value of `elem` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - `elem` is described as the next element in `sng` that will be processed.
   - Since `sng` is a non-empty list with at least one more element, `elem` is a specific integer value from this list.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the value of `elem` followed by a space. The exact value of `elem` is not provided, but it is known to be an integer from the list `sng`.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the next element in the non-empty list sng that will be processed)**
