You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, and 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9). prices is a list of n integers where 1 <= prices[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n.
def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    pq = [(price, i) for i, price in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        price += price_increase
        
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, the variables will have the following states: `total_cost` will be the sum of the costs of all tickets bought, `tickets_bought` will be equal to `k`, and `price_increase` will be equal to `k`. The heap `pq` will be empty or the remaining elements in `pq` will have prices that are higher than the prices of the tickets already bought.
    return total_cost
    #The program returns `total_cost`, which is the sum of the costs of all tickets bought.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. It returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, where the cost is calculated based on the given prices of `n` items.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `total_cost`, which is the sum of the costs of all tickets bought.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
