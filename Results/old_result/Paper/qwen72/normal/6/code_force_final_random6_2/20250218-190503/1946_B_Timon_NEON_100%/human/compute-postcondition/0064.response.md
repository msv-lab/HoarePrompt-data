The only objects in the loop head are the variables `segment` and `segments_variants`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop progresses through `segments_variants`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `len(arr) - 1`
- `max_sum` is -1
- `new_segment` is an empty list if the last element of `arr` is negative, otherwise it is `[sum of all non-negative elements from the last segment, index of the last non-negative element]`
- `max_segment` is `[sum of the maximum segment of non-negative elements, starting index of the maximum segment]`
- `segments_variants` is a list of lists that must have at least two elements
- `segment` is the second element in `segments_variants`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The `segment` variable will be updated to the next element in `segments_variants`.
- The `segments_variants` list must have at least three elements for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `segment` will be the third element in `segments_variants`.
- `segments_variants` must have at least three elements.

State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list if the last element of `arr` is negative, otherwise it is `[sum of all non-negative elements from the last segment, index of the last non-negative element]`, `max_segment` is `[sum of the maximum segment of non-negative elements, starting index of the maximum segment]`, `segments_variants` is a list of lists that must have at least three elements, and `segment` is the third element in `segments_variants`.**
