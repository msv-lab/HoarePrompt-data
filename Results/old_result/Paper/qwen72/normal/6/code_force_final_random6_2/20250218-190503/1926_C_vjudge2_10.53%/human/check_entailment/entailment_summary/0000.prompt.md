Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of integers to be processed. It then reads `t` integers from user input and stores them in a list `numbers`. The function initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, with a length of `max(numbers) + 1` (if `numbers` is not empty) to store specific integer values and their cumulative sums, respectively. The first 10 elements of `values` and `sum_values` are set to the integers 0 through 9 and their cumulative sums, respectively. For each integer `i` from 10 to the maximum value in `numbers`, the function calculates the value at index `i` in `values` as the sum of the values at the indices corresponding to the last digit and the remainder of `i` when split into digits. The cumulative sum up to `i` is stored in `sum_values`. Finally, the function prints the cumulative sum for each integer in `numbers`. The function does not return any value.
