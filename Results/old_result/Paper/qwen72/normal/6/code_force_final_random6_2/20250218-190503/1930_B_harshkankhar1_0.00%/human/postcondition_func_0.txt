The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` from the user input, where `3 <= n <= 10^5`. It then creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The elements at even indices of the list are reversed, and the modified list is printed. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the list `a` is printed in a modified form where the elements at even indices are reversed, and the program state is unchanged except for the printed output.
