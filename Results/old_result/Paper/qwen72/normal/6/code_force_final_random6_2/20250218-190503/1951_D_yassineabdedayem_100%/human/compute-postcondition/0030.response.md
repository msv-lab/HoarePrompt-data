The code snippet `n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())` reads two integers from the input line and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. This means the initial values of `n` and `k` are overwritten with the new values read from the input.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 0 < t < 1000
- `n` is the first integer read from the input line
- `k` is the second integer read from the input line
- If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k`
- If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`
- If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`

After executing the code:
- `n` is now the first integer read from the input line
- `k` is now the second integer read from the input line

The conditions involving `n` and `k` are still valid, but they will be evaluated based on the new values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 < t < 1000, `n` is the first integer read from the input line, `k` is the second integer read from the input line, if `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k`, if `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, if `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.**
