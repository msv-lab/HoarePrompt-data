Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string and has at least two elements, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 0 if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - 1`, and `c` is the second element of `s`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at the index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. The value of `c` is the second element of the list `s`, and the other variables (`n`, `s`, `zeroes`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. The updated value of `cnt[c]` is `cnt[c] + 1`.
