The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, and an additional parameter `t` that represents the number of test cases. Each test case involves `n` and `k`, which are positive integers with the constraints 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and `t` is an integer with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.

The function returns different values based on the input parameters for each test case. Since the output is not specified, we can infer that the function likely processes each test case and returns a result for each case, but the exact nature of the result is not provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18). The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output for each case is not provided.**
