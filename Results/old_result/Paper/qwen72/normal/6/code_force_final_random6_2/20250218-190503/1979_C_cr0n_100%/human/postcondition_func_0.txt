The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` and returns their least common multiple (LCM). The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both `a` and `b`. After the function concludes, the input variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the function returns the LCM of `a` and `b`.
