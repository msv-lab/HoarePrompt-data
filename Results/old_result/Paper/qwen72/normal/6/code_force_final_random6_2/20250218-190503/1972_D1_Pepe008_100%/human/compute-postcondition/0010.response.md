The value of `suma` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Given the initial state, `suma` was initially equal to `x`, which is `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1` and simplifies to `a`. After the increment, `suma` is now `a + 1`. The value of `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i` is still `a`, and `((a - i * (i - 1)) % i` remains unchanged. The other initial conditions are still valid.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is `a + 1`, `i` is 1, `x` is `a`, and the value of `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i` is `a`. Additionally, `((a - i * (i - 1)) % i` is unchanged.**
