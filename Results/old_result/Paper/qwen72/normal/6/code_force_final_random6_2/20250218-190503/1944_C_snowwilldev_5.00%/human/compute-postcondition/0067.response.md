Output State: **`N` is the value of `int(input())`, `i` is `N-1`, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `tc` must be less than the value returned by `int(input())`**

Explanation:
- `N` is updated to the value of `int(input())`.
- `i` remains `N-1`, as it was initially set to `N-1` and is not modified by the code.
- `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`, which is still valid.
- `tc` is incremented by 1, and it must still be less than the value returned by `int(input())`.
- The initial state of `N` remains the same, but its value is now updated to the input value.
