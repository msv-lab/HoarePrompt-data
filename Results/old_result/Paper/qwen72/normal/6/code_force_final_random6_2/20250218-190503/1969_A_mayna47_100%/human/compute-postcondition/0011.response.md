Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `i` is 2, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user. If `v[v[i]]` is equal to `i`, the program returns nothing. Otherwise, `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i` and the program also returns nothing.***
