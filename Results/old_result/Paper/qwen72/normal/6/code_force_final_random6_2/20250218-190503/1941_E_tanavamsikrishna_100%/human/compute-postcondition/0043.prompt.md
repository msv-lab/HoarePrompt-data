Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0] = 1`, `row[-1] = 0`, and for each index `i` in the range `1` to `d-1`, `row[i]` is `row[i] + 2 * (d-1)`. `d` remains a positive integer such that `1 <= d < len(row)`, and `i` is `d-1`. `min_heap` is now a heapified list of tuples containing the elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(d, len(row)):
    while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
        pass
    row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
    heappush(min_heap, e)
    heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop will terminate when the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` is no longer met. After all iterations, `i` will be `d + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop executed, and `min_heap` will be a heapified list of tuples containing the elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`, but with the first `k` elements removed and `e` pushed back into the heap. The value of `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`. The values of `row` and `d` remain unchanged. The tuple `(row[i], i)` is pushed into `min_heap`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop will continue to execute until the smallest index in `min_heap` is greater than `i - (d + 2)`. After all iterations, `i` will remain `d + k + 3`, `row` will still be a list with at least `d + k + 1` elements, `d` will remain unchanged, and `min_heap` will be a heapified list of tuples containing elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`, but with the first `k + 1` elements removed and `e` and `(row[i], i)` pushed back into the heap, and all indices in `min_heap` will be greater than `i - (d + 2)`. The value of `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`. The tuple `e` and the new tuple `(row[i], i)` are now included in `min_heap` and the heap is re-heapified.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `d + k + 4`, `row` is a list with at least `d + k + 1` elements, `d` remains unchanged, `min_heap` is a heapified list of tuples containing elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`, but with the first `k + 1` elements removed, and `min_heap` now contains the tuple `(row[i], i)` as an additional element, and `row[i]` is updated to the value of the smallest element in `min_heap` (excluding elements with indices less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`) plus the original value of `row[i]` plus 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
