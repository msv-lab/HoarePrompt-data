Precondition: **The function should take two parameters, x and y, where x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.**

```
def func():
```
This does not match the problem description, as it does not include the parameters `x` and `y`. The correct function definition should be:
```
def func(x, y):
```
