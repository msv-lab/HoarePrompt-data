The `break` statement causes the program to exit the loop it is currently in, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that the loop has been exited.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 1`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, the loop continues with the current values of `v` and `u`. The current value of `v` is in the `remaining_vertices` list. `v` is appended to the `path` list. `v` is removed from the `remaining_vertices` list. We have exited the loop.**
