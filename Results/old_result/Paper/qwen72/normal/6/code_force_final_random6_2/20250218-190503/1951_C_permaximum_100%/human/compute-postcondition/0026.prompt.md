Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, and 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where 1 <= prices[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. `pq` is now a heap of tuples where each tuple contains a price from `prices` and its corresponding index, arranged such that the smallest price is at the root. `total_cost` is 0. `tickets_bought` is 0. `price_increase` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while tickets_bought < k:
    price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)
    price += price_increase
    tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
    total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
    tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
    price_increase += tickets_to_buy


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, and 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where 1 <= prices[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. `pq` is now a heap of tuples where each tuple contains a price from `prices` and its corresponding index, arranged such that the smallest price is at the root, but the smallest tuple has been removed. `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k)`. `price` is the smallest price in the initial `pq` heap plus `price_increase`. `day` is the corresponding index of this smallest price in the `prices` list. `price_increase` is `tickets_bought`. `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, and 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where 1 <= prices[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. `pq` is now a heap of tuples where the smallest tuple has been removed, and the smallest price is at the root. `price` is the smallest price in the initial `pq` heap plus `2 * price_increase`. `day` is the corresponding index of this smallest price in the `prices` list. `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy + price * tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k) + min(m, k - tickets_bought) + tickets_to_buy`. `price_increase` is `tickets_bought + tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, and 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where 1 <= prices[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. `pq` is now a heap of tuples where the smallest tuple has been removed. `price` is the smallest price in the initial `pq` heap plus `2 * price_increase + price_increase`. `day` is the corresponding index of this smallest price in the `prices` list. `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy + price * tickets_to_buy + price * tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k) + min(m, k - tickets_bought) + tickets_to_buy + min(m, k - tickets_bought)`. `price_increase` is `tickets_bought + tickets_to_buy + min(m, k - tickets_bought)`. `tickets_to_buy` is now `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`. `tickets_bought` must be less than `k` for the loop to execute one more time.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
