Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 0; `j` is len(arr) - 1.**

The length of `arr` remains within the specified range, and each element in `arr` still satisfies the condition 1 <= a_i <= len(arr). The variable `i` remains 0, and `j` is now set to the value of the length of `arr` minus 1.
