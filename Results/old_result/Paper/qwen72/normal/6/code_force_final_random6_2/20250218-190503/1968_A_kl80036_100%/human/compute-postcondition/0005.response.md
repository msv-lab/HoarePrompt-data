Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is `x - 1`**

Explanation: The code snippet `x = int(input())` updates the value of `x` to a new input integer that is greater than 0. Since `y` is defined as `x - 1`, `y` will be updated to the new value of `x - 1`. The value of `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `x` and `y` while keeping `i` the same.
