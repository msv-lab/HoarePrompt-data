### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function correctly returns the modulo of a given number with \(10^9 + 7\). It is a basic and correct implementation.
   
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - The function attempts to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
     - However, the logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed:
       - The condition `if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` does not correctly handle the case where `new_segment` is empty or where the current element is negative.
       - The function appends `new_segment` and `max_segment` to `segments_variants` multiple times, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.
       - The function does not handle the case where the entire array is negative correctly.
     - The function also does not return the correct maximum segment sum. It returns a list with the maximum sum and indices, but the indices are not used in the main logic, and the function should return the maximum sum directly.
   
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
     - This function is incomplete and does not perform any operations. It is supposed to compute the final answer based on the maximum segment sum found by `func_2` and the number of operations `k`, but it is currently just a placeholder.
     - The main logic in the program uses a formula to compute the final answer, but this formula is not derived from a correct understanding of the problem. Specifically, the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the operations and their impact on the array sum.

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program logic is flawed:
     - It uses the incorrect formula to compute the final answer.
     - It does not correctly handle the case where the entire array is negative.
     - It does not correctly handle the case where the maximum segment sum is zero or negative.
     - The program does not correctly simulate the operations described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program contains logical errors in `func_2` and the main logic, and `func_3` is not implemented. The provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
