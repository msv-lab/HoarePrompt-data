Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 2`, `path` is a list that may contain the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive) except `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n` and `d` remain unchanged.
- `v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`.
- The conditions for `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain the same, but `v` and `u` are now specific values returned by `func_1(d)`.
- If `v` is 0, the program will skip the rest of the current iteration, but this is not reflected in the state itself, only in the control flow.
