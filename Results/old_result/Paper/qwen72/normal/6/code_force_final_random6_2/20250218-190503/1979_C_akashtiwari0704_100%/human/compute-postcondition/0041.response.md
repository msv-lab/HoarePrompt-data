Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `bets` is an input integer greater than or equal to the length of `a`, `g` is 1, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`) is `prod // a[j]`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a`, and `sumo` is the integer value of the sum of all elements in `a` after the transformation. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no further changes are made. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `a` separated by spaces.**
