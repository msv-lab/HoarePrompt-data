Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 2, `y` is `x - 1`**

The code snippet `y = x - 1` reassigns the value of `y` to be `x - 1`. Since `x` is an input integer greater than 2, the value of `y` is now `x - 1`, which is a specific value based on the input `x`. The value of `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 2, and `y` is `x - 1`.
