Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a` is an integer; `b` is an integer; `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1` depending on whether `b * 2` is divisible by 5. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`, and `t2` is `a - t1` and is divisible by 15. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`, and `t2` is `a - t1`.***
