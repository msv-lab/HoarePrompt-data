Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `int(input())` is greater than 1.
2. `i` is 2.
3. `n` and `k` are integers from the input split by a space.
4. `l` is a list of integers.
5. `c` is the sum of the positive elements in the list `l` that are not immediately followed by a negative element whose absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`.
6. `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `c` and `maxi`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input and Variable Initialization:**
   - `int(input())` is greater than 1, but this value is not used in the code snippet.
   - `n` and `k` are integers from the input split by a space. For example, if the input is "5 3", then `n = 5` and `k = 3`.
   - `l` is a list of integers. For example, `l = [1, -2, 3, 4, -5]`.

2. **Calculation of `c`:**
   - `c` is the sum of the positive elements in the list `l` that are not immediately followed by a negative element whose absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`.
   - Let's consider the example list `l = [1, -2, 3, 4, -5]`:
     - The first element is 1, which is positive.
     - The next element is -2, whose absolute value (2) is greater than 1, so 1 is not included in `c`.
     - The third element is 3, which is positive.
     - The next element is 4, which is positive, so 3 is included in `c`.
     - The fifth element is 4, which is positive.
     - The next element is -5, whose absolute value (5) is greater than 4, so 4 is not included in `c`.
   - Therefore, `c` in this example is 3.

3. **Calculation of `maxi`:**
   - `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `c` and `maxi`.
   - Since `maxi` is not explicitly initialized, we assume it is initially 0.
   - After the first calculation, `maxi` will be the maximum of 0 and `c`, which is `c` (3 in this example).

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The expression to be printed is `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.
   - Let's break it down:
     - `2 ** k` is 2 raised to the power of `k`.
     - `maxi` is the value of `c` (3 in this example).
     - `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.
   - For the example list `l = [1, -2, 3, 4, -5]`, `sum(l) = 1 + (-2) + 3 + 4 + (-5) = 1`.

5. **Substitute the Values:**
   - `2 ** k * maxi` is `2 ** 3 * 3 = 8 * 3 = 24`.
   - `24 - maxi` is `24 - 3 = 21`.
   - `21 + sum(l)` is `21 + 1 = 22`.
   - Finally, `22 % 1000000007` is 22 (since 22 is less than 1000000007).

### Output:
Output: **22 (where `k` is the second integer from the input, `maxi` is the sum of the positive elements in the list `l` that are not immediately followed by a negative element whose absolute value is greater than or equal to `maxi`, and `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`)**

This output is based on the given initial state and the example list `l = [1, -2, 3, 4, -5]`. The exact numerical value will depend on the specific values of `k`, `l`, and the initial value of `maxi` (if provided).
