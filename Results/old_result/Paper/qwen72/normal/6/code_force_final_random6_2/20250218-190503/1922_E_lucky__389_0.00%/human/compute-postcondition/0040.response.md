The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` must be at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition must still hold true after the next iteration, which means `2 ** (1 + 1) <= x + 1` must be true. This simplifies to `4 <= x + 1`, or `x >= 3`.

Since `i` is 1 and `x` must be at least 1, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `x` must be at least 3. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be at least 3, and `mx` is the maximum of the previous `mx` and 0**
