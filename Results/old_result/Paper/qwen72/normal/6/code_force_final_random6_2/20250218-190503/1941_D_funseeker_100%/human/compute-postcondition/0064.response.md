The only objects in the loop head are the variable `q` and the list `ans`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `ans`. If `ans` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again for the next element.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace.
- `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace.
- `n` is unchanged.
- `m` is `m - len(ans) - 1`.
- `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `ans` must contain at least one element.
- `q` is the next element in `ans`.
- `temp` is an empty set unless `c` is '0', '1', or '?'. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains the element `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` also contains the element `(q - r) % n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must have at least one more element. The variable `q` will be the next element in `ans`.

State: **`r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - len(ans) - 1`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` must contain at least two elements, `q` is the second element in `ans`, and `temp` is an empty set unless `c` is '0', '1', or '?'. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains the element `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` also contains the element `(q - r) % n`.**
