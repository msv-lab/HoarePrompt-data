Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `n + 2`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, where each element `v[i]` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the first `n` elements of `data` starting from index 2, `cnt` is `v[0]`, `i` is 1, and if `v[1]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated to `ans + v[1] * (v[1] - 1) * (v[1] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
