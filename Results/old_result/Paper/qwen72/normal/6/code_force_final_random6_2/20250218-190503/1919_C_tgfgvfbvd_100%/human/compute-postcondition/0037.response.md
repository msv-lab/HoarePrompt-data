Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ t), `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is the smallest integer in the first `n` elements of `l`, `b` is the second smallest integer in the first `n` elements of `l`, and `c` is the count of elements in the first `n` elements of `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all `n` iterations.
- The variable `x` has reached the value `n - 1`, indicating the last iteration.
- The variable `a` holds the smallest integer found in the first `n` elements of the list `l`.
- The variable `b` holds the second smallest integer found in the first `n` elements of the list `l`.
- The variable `c` counts how many elements in the first `n` elements of `l` are greater than both `a` and `b`.
