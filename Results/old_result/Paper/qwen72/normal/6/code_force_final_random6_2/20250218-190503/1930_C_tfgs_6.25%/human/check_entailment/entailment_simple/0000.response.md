### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Modification of Array `a`:**
   - The program iterates over the list `a` and modifies each element by adding its index plus one (`a[i] += i + 1`). This step is correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the modified list `a`.
   - It then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts the set in descending order. This step ensures that `a` contains only unique elements and is sorted in descending order, which is necessary for constructing the lexicographically largest array `b`.

4. **Constructing Array `b`:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the elements of the final array `b`.
   - It iterates over the sorted unique elements in `a` and adds them to `ans`.
   - For each element in `a`, it also adds additional elements to `ans` to fill the gaps between consecutive elements, ensuring that the total length of `ans` is `n`. This is done by decrementing the last added element and appending it to `ans` until the required number of elements is added.

5. **Final Adjustments:**
   - After the main loop, if there are still elements to be added to `ans` (i.e., `cnt` is not zero), it appends the necessary number of decrementing elements to `ans` to ensure the total length is `n`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces, which is the correct format for the output.

### Correctness:
The program appears to follow the problem description and correctly constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` by ensuring that all elements are unique and sorted in descending order. The steps to handle duplicates and fill gaps are logically sound and align with the requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
