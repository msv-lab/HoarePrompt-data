The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `nums`. The loop will execute if `len(nums) - 2` is greater than 0, which means `len(nums)` must be greater than 2. Given that `nums` is already described as a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, the loop will execute without needing to adjust the length of `nums`.

However, for the loop to start, `i` must be set to 0, and the condition `len(nums) - 2 > 0` must be true. Since `len(nums) > 3` is already true, `len(nums) - 2 > 0` is also true.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `i` is 0 and `nums` has a length greater than 3.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `cd` is 0, `i` is 0**
