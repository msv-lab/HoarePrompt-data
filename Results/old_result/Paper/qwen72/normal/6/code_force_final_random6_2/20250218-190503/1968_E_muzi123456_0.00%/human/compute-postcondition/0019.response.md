The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 48\).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` function is called with the string `'1'` as the first argument.
   - The `end` parameter is set to `' '`, which means that after printing the string `'1'`, the cursor will remain on the same line and add a space instead of moving to the next line.

3. **Output**:
   - The string `'1'` will be printed.
   - After printing `'1'`, a space will be added to the output.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 **

Explanation:
- The `print` statement will output the string `'1'` followed by a space.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` are not used in the `print` statement, so they do not affect the output.
