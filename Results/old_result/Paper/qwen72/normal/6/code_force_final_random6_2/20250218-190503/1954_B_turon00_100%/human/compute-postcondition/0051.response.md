Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new list `a`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is either 2 or 0, `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `cnt`.
- If `a[i-1]` (which is `a[1]`) is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is `n`.
- If `a[i-1]` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and 1.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `i` remain unchanged.
