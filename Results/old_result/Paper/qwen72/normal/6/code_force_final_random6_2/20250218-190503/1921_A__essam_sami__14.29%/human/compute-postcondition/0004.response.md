Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `c` and `d` are integers provided by the user input, `e` and `f` are integers provided by the user input.**

The initial state remains unchanged for `t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The code snippet assigns new integer values to `e` and `f` based on user input, so `e` and `f` are now integers provided by the user input.
