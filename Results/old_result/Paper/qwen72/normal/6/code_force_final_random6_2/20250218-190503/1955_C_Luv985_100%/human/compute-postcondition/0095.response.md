Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, `t` is `k % 2`**

The variable `t` is assigned the value of `k % 2`, which is the remainder when `k` is divided by 2. The values of `l`, `r`, `k`, `mi`, and the condition `mi * 2` > `k` remain unchanged.
