Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `k`, and `m` are assigned the values provided by the user input, and these values are integers. The constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26 are still valid. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, and `s` is now updated to the user input string. `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. `win` is an empty set. `ans` is an empty list. `ps` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in us:
        win.add(i)
        if len(win) == k:
            ans.append(i)
            ps += 1
            win.clear()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input, with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, and it is now updated to the user input string, which must have at least one character. `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. If `i` (the first character in `s`) is in `us`, and if `len(win) == k`, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the first character of `s`, `ps` is 1, and `i` is the first character in `s`, which is one of the first k lowercase English alphabets. Otherwise, if `i` is in `us`, `win` contains the first character of `s`, `ans` is an empty list, `ps` is 0, and `i` is the first character in `s`, which is one of the first k lowercase English alphabets. If `i` is not in `us`, `win` remains an empty set, `ans` remains an empty list, `ps` remains 0, and `i` is the first character in `s`, which is one of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, and it is now updated to the user input string, which must have at least one character. `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. `i` is the second character in `s`, which is one of the first k lowercase English alphabets. If `i` is in `us` and `len(win) == k`, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list that now includes the second character in `s`, and `ps` is incremented by 1. If `i` is in `us` and `len(win) != k`, `win` is a set that now contains the second character in `s`. If `i` is not in `us`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, and it must have at least 3 characters. `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. `i` is the third character in `s`, which is one of the first k lowercase English alphabets. If `i` is in `us` and `len(win) == k`, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list that now includes the second character in `s` and the third character in `s`, and `ps` is incremented by 1. If `i` is in `us` and `len(win) != k`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration. If `i` is not in `us`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps` also remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
