The function `func_1` is intended to accept parameters `n`, `k`, and `s`. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters. Given the constraints, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. The function prints 'YES' and returns None.
