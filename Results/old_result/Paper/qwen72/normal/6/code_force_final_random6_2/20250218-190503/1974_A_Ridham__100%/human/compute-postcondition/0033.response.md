The code snippet `result.append(screen_require_for_y)` appends the value of `screen_require_for_y` to the list `result`. The value of `screen_require_for_y` is determined based on the value of `y` as follows: if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`, `result` is a list that includes `screen_require_for_y`.**
