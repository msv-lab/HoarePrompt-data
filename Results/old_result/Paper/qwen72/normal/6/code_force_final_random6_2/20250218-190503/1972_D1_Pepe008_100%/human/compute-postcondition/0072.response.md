Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings from user input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to `a` and at least 1, `i` is 3, `x` is \(\frac{a - 2}{4} + 1\) before the code, and `x` is now \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - 3 \times 2}{3^2} \right\rfloor + 1\).**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `x` using the expression \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
- The value of `i` is 3.
- The expression becomes \((a - 3 \times 2) // 3^2 + 1\), which simplifies to \((a - 6) // 9 + 1\).
- The floor division `//` ensures that the result is an integer.
- The new value of `x` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - 6}{9} \right\rfloor + 1\).
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
