Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the binary search algorithm as described in the problem. Specifically, the binary search logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. The problem description specifies that the binary search should end when `r - l = 1`, but the program uses `l <= r` as the condition, which can lead to incorrect behavior. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the element `x` is not found in the array, and it does not follow the correct output format as specified in the problem description.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
The program will output:
```
1
4 3
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
2
4 5
2 4
```
This is because the program does not correctly identify the need for two swaps to place the element `3` in the correct position for the binary search to work. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
