The only objects in the loop head are the variables `n` and the list `numbers`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers`. If `numbers` has more elements, the loop will execute again with the next element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, and `n` is the first input integer from the `numbers` list. For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `numbers` must be assigned to `n`. Since `n` was the first element, the next element will be the second element in the list.

State: **`total` is 45, `i` is the second input integer from the `numbers` list, `n` is the second input integer from the `numbers` list, `values` is a list of integers, `sum_values` is a list of integers, `numbers` must be a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements**
