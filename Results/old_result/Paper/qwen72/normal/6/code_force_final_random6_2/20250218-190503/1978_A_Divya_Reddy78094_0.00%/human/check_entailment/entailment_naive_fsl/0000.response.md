Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the two highest numbers are the same and appear more than once. According to the problem description, Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile. If the two highest numbers are the same and appear more than once, the program will incorrectly add the same highest number twice, which is not what the problem description specifies.

Example case where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  3 3 1
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  4
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  6
  ```

In this case, the two highest numbers are 3, and the program will output 6, which is incorrect because Alice should only read one book with the highest number from each pile, resulting in a total of 4 pages.
