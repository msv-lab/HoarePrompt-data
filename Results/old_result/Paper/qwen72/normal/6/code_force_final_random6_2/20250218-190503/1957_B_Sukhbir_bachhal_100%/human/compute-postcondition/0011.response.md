The value of `n` is shifted right by 1 bit, which is equivalent to dividing `n` by 2 and truncating the result to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50000\), after the shift, `n` will be an integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 25000\). The value of `k` is still an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), and `n` is not equal to 0 (if it was 1 before, it will become 0). The value of `position` remains 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 25000\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `n` is not equal to 0 if it was greater than 1 before, `position` is 2.**
