Output State: **The program returns 0.** 

The loop conditions and the variables `i`, `j`, and `arr` do not affect the return value because the code snippet only contains a single line that returns the constant value 0. Therefore, regardless of the loop's termination state or the values of `i`, `j`, and `arr`, the program will always return 0.
