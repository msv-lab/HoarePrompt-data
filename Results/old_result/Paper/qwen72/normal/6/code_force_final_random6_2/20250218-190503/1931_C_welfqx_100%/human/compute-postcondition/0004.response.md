The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into individual components, converting each component into an integer and storing them in a list called `num`. The values of `t`, `r`, `n`, and `f` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
