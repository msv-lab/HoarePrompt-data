Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is `t - 1`. `a` and `b` are lists of integers where each element in `a` is less than or equal to the next element in `a`, and each element in `b` is less than or equal to the next element in `b`. `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable remains an integer between 1 and 10^4, as it was initially.
- **`_`**: This variable remains 0, as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`n`**: This variable remains equal to `t`, as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`lit`**: This is the list of integers provided by the user and remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`cp`**: This variable remains 0, as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `t - 1`, which is the last index of the range `0` to `n-1`.
- **`a` and `b`**: These lists are populated based on the conditions within the loop. Each element in `a` is less than or equal to the next element in `a`, and each element in `b` is less than or equal to the next element in `b`. This means that `a` and `b` are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- **`x`**: This variable is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty. If `a` is empty, `x` remains positive infinity.
- **`y`**: This variable is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty. If `b` is empty, `y` remains positive infinity.

The loop iterates through each element in the `lit` list and appends it to either `a` or `b` based on the current values of `x` and `y`. The conditions ensure that `a` and `b` are sorted in non-decreasing order, and `x` and `y` are updated to the last elements of `a` and `b` respectively, if they are not empty.
