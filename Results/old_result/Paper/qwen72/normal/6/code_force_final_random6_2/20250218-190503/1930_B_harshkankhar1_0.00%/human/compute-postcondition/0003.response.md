The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, the parameter constraint provided indicates that `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5. Since `n` is not a parameter of the function, it must be a global variable or defined within the function. The output is not specified, so we cannot determine what the function returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It is expected to return a value based on a global variable `n` or a variable `n` defined within the function, where `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5. The specific return value is not provided.**
