The only objects in the loop head are the variable `elem` and the list `sng`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `sng`. If `sng` has more elements, the loop will execute again with the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `elem` is the first element in `sng`, and `sng` must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have at least 2 elements, and `elem` will be the second element in `sng`.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus 1, `sng` must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
