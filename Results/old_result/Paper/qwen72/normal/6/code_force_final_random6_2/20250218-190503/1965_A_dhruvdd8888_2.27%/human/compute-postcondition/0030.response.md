The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second element is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The length of `test_cases` is `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function evaluates each test case and prints one of the following:
- Case_1: If a certain condition is met, the program prints 'Alice' and returns `None`.
- Case_2: If a different condition is met, the program prints 'Bob' and returns `None`.
- Case_3: If another condition is met, the program prints 'Bob' and returns `None`.
- Case_4: If a final condition is met, the program prints 'Alice' and returns `None`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. It evaluates each test case and prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the conditions of the game, and returns `None`.**
