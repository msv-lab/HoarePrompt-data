Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 2, and if `l[2]` is less than or equal to `b`, `c` is 0. If `a` > `b`, `a` and `b` have swapped their values; otherwise, `a` and `b` retain their original values. If `l[2]` is greater than `b`, `c` is 1, and `a` is set to `l[2]`. If `a` > `b`, `a` and `b` have swapped their values; otherwise, `a` and `b` retain their original values.***
