Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are lists, `s` is 0, and `x` and `y` are updated based on the following conditions: If `x > y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `b` contains the first element of `lit`, `y` is set to `lit[i]`, and `x` remains the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty. If `x > y` and `lit[i] > x`, `b` includes `lit[i]`, `y` is set to `lit[i]`, and `x` remains the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty. If `x > y` and `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`, `a` includes the first element of `lit`, `x` is set to `lit[0]`, and `y` remains the last element of `b` or positive infinity if `b` is empty. If `x ≤ y` and `x == y`, `a` contains the first element of `lit`, `x` is set to `lit[0]`, and `y` remains positive infinity if `b` is empty or the last element of `b`. If `x ≤ y` and `x < y` and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x ≤ y` and `x < y` and `x < lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, `a` includes `lit[0]` as its last element, and `x` is updated to `lit[0]`. If `x ≤ y` and `x < y` and `x < lit[i]` and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If none of these conditions are met, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
