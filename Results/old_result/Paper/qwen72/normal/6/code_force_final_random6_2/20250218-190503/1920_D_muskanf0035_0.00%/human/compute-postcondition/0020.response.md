The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `q`, and `operations`, `queries`. 

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5.
- `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each sublist contains two integers `b` and `x`. The value of `b` is either 1 or 2, and `1 <= x <= n` for `b=1`, while `1 <= x <= 10^9` for `b=2`.
- `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers, where each integer `k_i` satisfies 1 <= k_i <= min(10^18, c), and `c` is the size of the array after all operations have been applied.

The function processes the operations and then answers the queries based on the resulting array. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries`. It processes a series of operations on an array and returns the results of the queries based on the modified array.**
