Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 0, `max` is 0, `_` is less than `t`, `temp` is a list containing the first three elements of `a`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `temp = a[i:i + 3]` creates a new list `temp` that contains the first three elements of the list `a`, since `i` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
