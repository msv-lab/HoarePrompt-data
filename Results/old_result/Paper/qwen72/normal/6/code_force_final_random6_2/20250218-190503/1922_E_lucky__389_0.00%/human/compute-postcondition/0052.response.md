Output State: **`x` is 0, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a single positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is a list containing integers `i` such that the sum of \(2^i - 1\) for all `i` in `subseq_lens` equals the initial value of `x`. `mx` is the maximum integer `i` that was appended to `subseq_lens`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`x`**: After all iterations of the loop, `x` will be 0. This is because the loop continues to subtract \(2^i - 1\) from `x` until `x` is no longer greater than or equal to \(2^i - 1\) for any `i` greater than 0.
- **`func_1`**: The function's purpose and constraints remain unchanged. It is still expected to handle multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer `X` within the specified range, and return an array of integers that meets the criteria.
- **`subseq_lens`**: This list will contain integers `i` such that the sum of \(2^i - 1\) for all `i` in `subseq_lens` equals the initial value of `x`. Each `i` represents the largest power of 2 that can be subtracted from `x` at each iteration.
- **`mx`**: This variable will hold the maximum integer `i` that was appended to `subseq_lens` during the loop execution. It keeps track of the largest power of 2 used in the process.
