#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters `n`, `k`, and `s`. `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, and it is now updated to the user input string. `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. `win` is an empty set. `ans` is a list containing the characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach a size of `k` and then cleared `win`. `ps` is the number of times `win` reached a size of `k` and was cleared.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES' and returns None.
    #State: `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, and it is now updated to the user input string. `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. `win` is an empty set. `ans` is a list containing the characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach a size of `k` and then cleared `win`. `ps` is the number of times `win` reached a size of `k` and was cleared, and `ps` is less than `n`.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets, `win` is a set that may or may not contain any elements from `us`, `ans` is a list containing the characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach a size of `k` and then cleared `win`, `ps` is the number of times `win` reached a size of `k` and was cleared, and `ps` is less than `n`. The loop has printed a string for each element in `us` that was not in `win` at the time of iteration, and `win` has been updated to include these elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads user input to determine `n`, `k`, and `m` (integers), and a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It then processes `s` to find sequences of `k` unique characters. If the number of such sequences reaches `n`, the function prints 'YES' and returns `None`. If fewer than `n` sequences are found, the function prints 'NO' and, for each unique character in the first `k` alphabets that was not part of the last sequence, it prints a string composed of the characters that formed the sequences, followed by the missing character, and padded with 'a' characters to reach a length of `n`.
