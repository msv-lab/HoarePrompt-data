Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k` as required.

2. **Case Handling**:
   - **When `k == n`**: The program creates an array `res` with `n` elements, all set to 1. This is correct because if `k == n`, every cyclic shift of the array must be sorted, and an array with all elements equal (like `[1, 1, ..., 1]`) will always satisfy this condition.
   - **When `k == 1`**: The program creates an array `res` with elements from 0 to `n-1` (i.e., `range(n)`). This is correct because if `k == 1`, only one cyclic shift should be sorted, and an array with strictly increasing elements (like `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`) will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift (the original array itself).
   - **When `k != 1` and `k != n`**: The program outputs `-1`. This is incorrect because the problem does not state that there is no solution for `k` values other than 1 or `n`. In fact, for some values of `k` (e.g., `k = 2`), there can be valid arrays that satisfy the condition. For example, for `n = 4` and `k = 2`, the array `[1, 2, 3, 1]` has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2, 3]`.

3. **Output**: The program correctly prints the elements of `res` for each test case. However, the logic for handling cases where `k` is neither 1 nor `n` is flawed, as it incorrectly assumes that no valid array exists.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it fails to handle cases where `k` is neither 1 nor `n` and outputs `-1` for those cases, which is not always the correct solution.

Correctness: **False**
