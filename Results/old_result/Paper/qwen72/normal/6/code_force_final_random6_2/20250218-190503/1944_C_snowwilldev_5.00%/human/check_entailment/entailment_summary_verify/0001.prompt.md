You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads input for multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `N` and a list `a` of `N` integers. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each integer in `a`. It then iterates through the list `a` and prints the first index `i` where the count of `i` is 1 and the count of any previous index was 1, or where the count of `i` is 0. If no such index is found, the function implicitly ends the test case without printing anything. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing elements from an array `a`.
   - Alice appends the chosen element to an array `c` and then removes it from `a`.
   - Bob removes the chosen element from `a` but does not append it to `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The score of the game is the MEX of the array `c`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the score, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX.
   - If both players play optimally, the MEX of `c` will be determined by the smallest element that appears fewer than twice in `a`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It iterates through the elements from 0 to `N-1` and checks the count of each element.
   - If an element appears exactly once, it increments a counter `t`.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or an element does not appear at all, it prints the current index `i` and breaks the loop.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It correctly identifies the smallest element that either appears fewer than twice or does not appear at all.
   - The logic of breaking the loop when `t` reaches 2 or when an element does not appear at all is correct because it ensures that the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `c` after both players have played optimally.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all elements are the same (e.g., `[1, 1, 1, 1]`), correctly outputting 0.
   - It also handles the case where the array `a` is empty, which is not possible given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob and will output the correct MEX for the array `c` after the game ends.

Correctness: **True**
