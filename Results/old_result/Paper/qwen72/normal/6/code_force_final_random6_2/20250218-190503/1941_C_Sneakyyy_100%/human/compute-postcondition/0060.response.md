Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `a` is an input string with a length of at least 3, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the first 3 characters of `a`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `s` is assigned the value of the substring of `a` starting from index `i` (which is 0) and ending at index `i + 3` (which is 3). Since `a` is an input string with a length of at least 3, `s` will be the first 3 characters of `a`.
- The values of `n`, `_`, `a`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
