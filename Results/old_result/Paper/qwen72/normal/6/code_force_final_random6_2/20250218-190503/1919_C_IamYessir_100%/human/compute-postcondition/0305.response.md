Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1. If `x > y` and `y >= lit[i]`, `b` has `lit[i]` appended to it, `x` is set to the last element of `a` (which may be `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`), and `y` is set to the last element of `b` (which is now `lit[i]`). If `x > y` and `y < lit[i]`, and the length of `a` is greater than 0, `x` is set to the last element of `a`; otherwise, `x` is infinity. If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is infinity, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If the length of `b` is greater than 0, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `lit[i] > x`, `b` has `lit[i]` appended to it, and `x` is set to the last element of `a` (which may be `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`), and `y` is set to the last element of `b` (which is now `lit[i]`). If `lit[i] <= x` and `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, `a` has `lit[i]` appended to it, and `x` is set to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i] <= x` and `x < lit[i]` and `lit[i] <= y`, `b` has `lit[i]` appended to it. Otherwise, the state of `a` and `b` remains unchanged, and `x` and `y` retain their values based on the conditions described in the precondition. If `x <= y` and `x == y`, `a` has one more element which is `lit[i]`, `x` is now `lit[i]`, and `b` remains unchanged. If `x < y` and `x >= lit[i]`, `a` has `lit[i]` appended to it, `b` remains unchanged, and `x` is set to `lit[i]` (the last element of `a`), with `y` remaining the same (infinity if the length of `b` is 0, or the last element of `b` if the length of `b` is greater than 0). If `x < y` and `x < lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, `a` has one more element which is `lit[i]`, `b` remains unchanged, and `x` is set to `lit[i]` (the last element of `a`), with `y` remaining the same (infinity if the length of `b` is 0, or the last element of `b` if the length of `b` is greater than 0). If `x < y` and `x < lit[i]` and `lit[i] <= y` but `lit[i] > x`, `b` has `lit[i]` appended to it, and `y` is now `lit[i]` (the last element of `b`). If `x < y` and `x < lit[i]` and `lit[i] <= y` and `lit[i] <= x`, the state of `b` remains unchanged, and `x` is set to the last element of `a` (which may be `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`), and `y` is set to the last element of `b` (which is `lit[i]` if `y < lit[i]`). If the length of `a` is 0, `x` is set to infinity. If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is set to infinity.***
