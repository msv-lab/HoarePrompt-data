Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `n` must be at least 2, `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15) and `k` must be non-zero, `nums` is a deque of `n-2` positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9) and `len(nums)` must be at least 2, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `a` is the second element of the original `nums` deque, `b` is the second-to-last element of the original `nums` deque, `x` is the minimum of the new `a` and `b`.**

Explanation:
- `a` and `b` are updated to the values of the first and last elements of the deque `nums` after `popleft()` and `pop()` are called, respectively.
- The first element of the original `nums` deque is removed, and `a` is assigned this value.
- The last element of the original `nums` deque is removed, and `b` is assigned this value.
- The new `a` is the second element of the original `nums` deque, and the new `b` is the second-to-last element of the original `nums` deque.
- `x` is updated to the minimum of the new `a` and `b`.
- The length of `nums` is now `n-2`, and it must still be at least 2.
- The values of `n`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
