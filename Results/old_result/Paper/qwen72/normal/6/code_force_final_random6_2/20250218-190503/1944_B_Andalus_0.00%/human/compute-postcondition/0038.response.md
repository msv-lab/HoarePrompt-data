Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`, `rdb` contains the element `rgt[3]`.** 

The code `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends the element at index `3` of the list `rgt` to the list `rdb`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
