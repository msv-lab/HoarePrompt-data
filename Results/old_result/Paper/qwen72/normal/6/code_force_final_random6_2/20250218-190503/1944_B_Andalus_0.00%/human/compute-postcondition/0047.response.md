To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context in which the print statement is executed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`T` is greater than 0**: This indicates that some condition or loop might be running, but it doesn't directly affect the print statement.
2. **`_` is 0**: This variable is likely a placeholder or a counter, but it doesn't directly affect the print statement.
3. **`n` and `k` are input integers**: These are user-provided integers.
4. **`lst` is a list of integers input by the user**: This is a list of integers provided by the user.
5. **`lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`**: This is a sorted sublist of `lst` from the start to the `n`-th element.
6. **`rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end**: This is a sorted sublist of `lst` from the `n`-th element to the end.
7. **`n` is greater than or equal to 1**: This ensures that `lft` is not empty.
8. **`i` is `n-1`**: This is an index that points to the last element of `lft` and the first element of `rgt`.
9. **`ldb` must contain at least one element**: This is a list that must have at least one element, but its exact content is not specified.
10. **`sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`**: This is a list of unique elements in `lft` that are not adjacent duplicates.
11. **`rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element**: This is a list of elements in `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding elements.
12. **`sz` is 0**: This is a zero-initialized variable.
13. **The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 2**: This means `k` is at least 2.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```
This statement prints the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space. The variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to infer its value from the context.

### Context Inference:
Given the initial state, the most likely context for `elem` is that it is an element from one of the lists (`lft`, `rgt`, `sng`, `rdb`, or `ldb`). However, since `elem` is not explicitly defined, we can't determine its exact value. The print statement will print whatever value `elem` holds at the time of execution.

### Conclusion:
Since `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can't determine its exact value. However, we can say that it will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the value of the variable `elem` at the time of execution)**
