Output State: **`t` is 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the value of `t` is reduced to 0 because the loop runs `t` times, decrementing `t` by 1 each time until it reaches 0. This means that the loop has completed all its iterations, and `t` is now 0.
