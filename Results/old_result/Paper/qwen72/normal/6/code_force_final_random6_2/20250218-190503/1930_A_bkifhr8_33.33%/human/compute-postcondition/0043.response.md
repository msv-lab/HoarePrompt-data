Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `ans` is the minimum of the integers obtained from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list that now includes the value of the previous `ans`, `t` must be greater than `n * 2`, `l` is an input string, and the length of `lst` is exactly 2.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated to the minimum value of the integers obtained from the first and second elements of `lst`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `lst`, `ans_f`, `t`, `l`) remain unchanged.
- The length of `lst` is still exactly 2.
