The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. The value of `t` remains the same as it is the total number of iterations the loop should run.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of the list `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. If `n * m == k`, then `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
