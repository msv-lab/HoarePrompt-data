The only variable in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `remaining_vertices`. If `remaining_vertices` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `path` is a list that may contain at most one value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, and `remaining_vertices` must not be empty. `d` is 0.**
