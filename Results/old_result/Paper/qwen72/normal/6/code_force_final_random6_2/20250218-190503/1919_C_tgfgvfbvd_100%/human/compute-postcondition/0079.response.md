Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is the smallest integer in the list `l`, `b` is the second smallest integer in the list `l` (if it exists, otherwise it remains `float('inf')`), and `c` is the number of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`. The loop will execute again if the input integer is greater than the current iteration count.**

The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer, which is greater than 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
