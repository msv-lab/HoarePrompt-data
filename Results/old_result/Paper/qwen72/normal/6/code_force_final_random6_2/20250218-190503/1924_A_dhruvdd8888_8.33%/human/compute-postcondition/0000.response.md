The code snippet `n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` reads input from the user, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`.

Given the initial state:
- The function should actually be defined with parameters `n`, `k`, and `s`.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26.
- `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 26.
- `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
- The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

After executing the code snippet:
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are now assigned the values provided by the user input.
- The values of `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers.
- The constraints on `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 26) are still valid.
- The variable `s` is still a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
- The number of test cases `t` and the constraints on the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `m` are assigned the values provided by the user input, and these values are integers. The constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26 are still valid. `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**
