Output State: **`bets` is greater than 0, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is the sum of all updated `a[i]` values, `T` is `t`, if `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`. Otherwise, `sumo` is less than `prod`, and `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space, `g` is updated to `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`, `l` is a list that must have at least one element, `i` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor function.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
