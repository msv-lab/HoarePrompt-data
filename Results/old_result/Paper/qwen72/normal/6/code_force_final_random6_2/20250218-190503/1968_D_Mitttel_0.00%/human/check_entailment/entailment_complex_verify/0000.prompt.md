You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes in parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`. It calculates the scores for two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their respective positions `PB` and `PS` within the permutation `p` and the list `a`.

The final state of the program is that it has returned one of these three strings, indicating the result of the score comparison.

If a cycle was detected, the sum includes elements accessed up to the position before the cycle started. If no cycle was detected, the sum includes elements accessed for the full `k` steps.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `calculate_score` accepts a parameter `start_pos`, which is a positive integer within the bounds of the permutation `p` and the array `a`. It returns the sum of the elements in `a` accessed through the permutation `p` starting from `start_pos` for up to `k` steps. If a cycle is detected within these steps, the function calculates the sum of elements for the initial non-cyclic part and then for the full cycles and any remaining steps within the cycle. If no cycle is detected, the function simply returns the sum of elements accessed for the full `k` steps. The function does not modify the input arrays `a` or `p`, and it maintains a dictionary `visited` to track the positions visited during the process.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed in the function signature, but the function reads from standard input, expecting a formatted string of integers. The input data is split and processed to extract the number of test cases t, the length of the permutation n, the duration of the game k, Bodya's starting position PB, Sasha's starting position PS, the permutation p, and the array a. The values of n, k, PB, and PS are integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The permutation p is a list of integers of length n, where each element p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n. The array a is a list of integers of length n, where each element a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a formatted string of integers from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results of each test case. Each test case includes the length of a permutation `n`, the duration of a game `k`, Bodya's starting position `PB`, Sasha's starting position `PS`, a permutation `p`, and an array `a`. The function calls `func_1` for each test case with the extracted parameters and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list. The function does not return any value; its primary purpose is to output the results of the game logic for each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the game mechanics, including the detection and handling of cycles in the permutation, which is crucial for games lasting more than a few turns. The `calculate_score` function accurately computes the score for each player by following the rules of the game, and the `func_1` function correctly determines the winner based on the scores. The `func_2` function properly reads the input and processes multiple test cases, ensuring that the program works for all potential inputs as specified in the problem description. No edge cases or missing logic have been identified that would cause the program to fail.
