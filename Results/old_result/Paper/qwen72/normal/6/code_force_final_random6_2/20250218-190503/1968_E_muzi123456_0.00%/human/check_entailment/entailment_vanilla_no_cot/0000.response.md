Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. The program always prints points along the first row of the grid, which results in a limited set of Manhattan distances. Specifically, it only generates distances that are the differences in the column indices, which are not sufficient to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the points should be chosen in such a way that they cover a wide range of possible Manhattan distances. A better approach would be to place points in a more strategic manner, such as placing them at the corners and along the diagonals of the grid, to ensure that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) contains the maximum number of distinct distances.

For example, for \(n = 3\), a correct output could be:
```
1 1
3 1
1 3
```
This would result in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 2, 4\}\), which has 3 distinct distances.

For \(n = 4\), a correct output could be:
```
1 1
1 4
4 1
4 4
```
This would result in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 3, 6\}\), which has 4 distinct distances.

The given program does not achieve this, so it is incorrect.
