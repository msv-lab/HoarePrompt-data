The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function will process multiple test cases, each with the following inputs:
- `t`: an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of distinct types of cards.
  - `k`: an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, representing the number of coins.
  - `a`: a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, representing the number of cards of type i.

The function will return a result for each test case based on the inputs provided. The exact return value is not specified, but it is expected to be a result derived from the number of cards and coins for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of distinct types of cards (`n`), the number of coins (`k`), and a list of the number of cards of each type (`a`). It returns a result for each test case based on the provided inputs.**
