Postcondition: **`t` is the input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 4, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in the input string `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `k` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `n - 4`, `y[i]` is `k`. If `t[i]` is 'R', `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m` and `q2` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is decremented by 1.**
