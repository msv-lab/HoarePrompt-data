Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are lists, `s` is 0. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity; otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of list `a`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity; otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of list `b`. If `x > y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]`, `lit[1]` is appended to `b` and `y` is set to `lit[1]`. If `x > y` and `lit[1]` is greater than `x`, `lit[1]` is appended to `b` and `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `x > y` and `lit[1]` is not greater than `x` but is greater than `y`, `lit[1]` is appended to `a` and `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If `x > y` and neither condition is met, the lists `a` and `b`, and the variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged. If `x ≤ y`, and `x` is equal to `y`, `lit[1]` is appended to `a` and `x` is set to `lit[1]`. If `x ≤ y` and `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]`, `lit[1]` is appended to `a` and `x` is set to `lit[1]`. If `x ≤ y` and `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is less than `lit[1]` and `lit[1]` is greater than `y`, `lit[1]` is appended to `a` and `x` is set to `lit[1]`. If `x ≤ y` and `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is less than `lit[1]` and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]` and `lit[1]` is greater than `x`, `lit[1]` is appended to `b` and `y` is set to `lit[1]`. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity.**
