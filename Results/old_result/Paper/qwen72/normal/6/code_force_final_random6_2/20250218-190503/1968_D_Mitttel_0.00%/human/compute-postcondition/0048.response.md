Based on the initial state provided, we know that `results` is a list that must contain at least three elements. The variable `result` is defined as the third element in the `results` list.

When the `print(result)` statement is executed, it will print the value of the third element in the `results` list.

Since the exact values of the elements in `results` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the third element of the list.

Output: **result (where result is the third element in the `results` list)**
