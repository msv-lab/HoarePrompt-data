Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 1 (this variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for now).
   - `i` is 1 (this variable is also not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it).
   - `n` and `k` are input integers.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` is the lowercase English alphabet.
   - The slice `[:k]` takes the first `k` characters from this string.
   - The `* n` operation repeats the resulting string `n` times.
   - The `print` statement outputs the final repeated string.

4. **Output**:
   - The output will be the first `k` characters of the alphabet repeated `n` times.
   - Since `k` and `n` are input integers, we can't determine their exact values, but we can describe the output in terms of `k` and `n`.

Output: **'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n (where k is the number of characters to take from the alphabet string and n is the number of times to repeat the resulting string)**
