Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the game outcome can be determined solely by the number of unique pile sizes and the difference between consecutive pile sizes. However, the game's outcome depends on the parity of the number of piles with the smallest size, not just the unique pile sizes.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
1 2 2
```
The expected output is "Alice" because Alice can choose \( k = 1 \) on her first turn, removing 1 stone from each pile, leaving the piles as \( 0, 1, 1 \). Bob will then be forced to choose \( k = 1 \) again, leaving the piles as \( 0, 0, 0 \), and Alice wins.

However, the program will output "Bob" because it incorrectly processes the input and does not correctly determine the game outcome based on the rules provided. The program should instead focus on the parity of the number of piles with the smallest size to determine the winner.
