Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18) and `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 0, `r` is 0, `j` is 3, `l` is 3, `sm` is `sum(lst[4:]) + 16`.**

The code snippet `r, l = [i, j]` assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `r` and `l` respectively. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 3, `r` is now 0 and `l` is now 3. The other variables `lst`, `i`, `j`, and `sm` remain unchanged.
