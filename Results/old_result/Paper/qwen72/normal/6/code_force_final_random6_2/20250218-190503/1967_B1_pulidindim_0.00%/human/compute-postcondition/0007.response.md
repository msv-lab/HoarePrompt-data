The value of `g` is assigned the result of `n` divided by `count`. Given that `count` is 2, `g` will be `n / 2`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / 2`.**
