You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Example

Input

    6
    
    3
    
    3 2 7
    
    2
    
    3 3
    
    5
    
    5 5 5 5 5
    
    6
    
    7 9 3 17 9 13
    
    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and k is a list of n integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20.

    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k` is a list of n integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list `k`, `numbers` is a list with at least n elements, `num` is the last element in the list `numbers`.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list `k`, where `k` is a list of `n` integers, and each integer `k_i` in the list satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list. The input list `numbers` is expected to contain at least one integer, and each integer in the list satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20. After the function concludes, the list `numbers` remains unchanged, and the returned value is the GCD of all elements in the list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the multipliers are all the same. For example, consider the following input:

```
2
3
3 3 3
```

For this input, the program will calculate `m` as `3 * 3 * 3 = 27`. The list `c` will be `[9, 9, 9]` after the division by `k[i]`. The HCF (highest common factor) of `c` will be `9`. The sum of `c` is `9 + 9 + 9 = 27`, and `m / hcf` is also `27 / 9 = 3`. The program will then check if `sum(c) >= m / hcf`, which evaluates to `27 >= 3`, and it will print `-1`.

However, a valid solution exists for this case. For example, you can bet `1` coin on each outcome, and the total bet is `3` coins. If any outcome wins, you will receive back `3 * 1 = 3` coins, which is exactly equal to the total bet. Since the problem requires the total amount of coins received back to be strictly greater than the total bet, this is not a valid solution, but the program incorrectly concludes that no solution exists.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
