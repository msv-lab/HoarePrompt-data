You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `T` is equal to the number of iterations the loop executed, and `i` is `T - 1`. For each iteration of the loop, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input. If `a` is equal to `b`, then `a` and `b` are the same integers provided by the user input. If `a` is not equal to `b`, then `a` and `b` are different integers provided by the user input. If `a` is 1, it remains 1, and if `b` is 1, `a` is not equal to `b`. If `b` is not 1, then `a` is not equal to `b` and `b` is not equal to 1. If `a` is odd, then `a` is an odd integer. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, then `a` is even and `b` is odd. If `a` > `b`, `a` is greater than `b`. Otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `T` from user input, indicating the number of test cases to process. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from user input. It then prints the name 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on the following conditions: if `a` equals `b`, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is 1, it prints 'Alice'; if `b` is 1, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is odd, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is even and `b` is odd, it prints 'Alice'; if `a` is greater than `b`, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state is that `T` iterations have been completed, with each iteration printing a result based on the provided `a` and `b` values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

2. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `a == b`**
     - If both players have the same number of coins, Bob will always win. This is because Alice will always be the first to make a move, and if both wallets have the same number of coins, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. Eventually, Alice will be the one who cannot make a move first.
   - **Case 2: `a == 1`**
     - If Alice has only 1 coin, she will lose because she cannot remove a coin without making her wallet empty, and Bob can always make a move.
   - **Case 3: `b == 1`**
     - If Bob has only 1 coin, Alice will win. Alice can swap wallets with Bob on her first move, and then Bob will be forced to remove a coin from his wallet, making it empty. Alice can then make a move, and Bob will be unable to make a move.
   - **Case 4: `a % 2 == 1`**
     - If Alice has an odd number of coins, Bob will win. This is because Alice will always be the one to make the last move that leaves an even number of coins, and Bob can then mirror Alice's moves until Alice is forced to make a move that leaves her wallet empty.
   - **Case 5: `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`**
     - If Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins, Alice will win. Alice can swap wallets with Bob, and then Bob will be forced to make a move with an even number of coins, which will eventually lead to Bob's wallet being empty.
   - **Case 6: `a > b`**
     - If Alice has more coins than Bob, Bob will win. This is because Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, and since Alice has more coins, she will be the one to make the last move that leaves her wallet with fewer coins than Bob's.
   - **Case 7: `a < b`**
     - If Alice has fewer coins than Bob, Alice will win. Alice can swap wallets with Bob, and then Bob will be forced to make a move with fewer coins, which will eventually lead to Bob's wallet being empty.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the cases where the number of coins in the wallets is the same, where one player has only 1 coin, and where the number of coins is odd or even.
- However, the logic for the cases where `a > b` and `a < b` is incorrect. The program assumes that if `a > b`, Bob will always win, and if `a < b`, Alice will always win. This is not always true. For example, if `a = 2` and `b = 3`, Alice can swap wallets with Bob and then win the game.
- The correct logic should be:
  - If `a` and `b` are both even, the player with the fewer coins will win.
  - If `a` and `b` are both odd, the player with the fewer coins will win.
  - If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice will win.
  - If `a` is odd and `b` is even, Bob will win.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the cases where `a` and `b` have different parities (odd/even) correctly.
