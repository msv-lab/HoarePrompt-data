You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        print(*res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer representing the length of the array a, and k is an integer representing the number of sorted cyclic shifts the array a must have, such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        
        print(*res)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `k` is the last input integer, `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k` equals `n`, `res` is a list containing numbers from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, otherwise `res` is a list containing `-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` is the length of an array and `k` is a parameter related to sorting cyclic shifts. The function then prints a list `res` based on the values of `n` and `k`: if `k` equals `n`, it prints a list of `n` ones; if `k` equals 1, it prints a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`; otherwise, it prints a list containing `-1`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, and `n`, `k`, and `res` holding the values of the last test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where \(1 < k < n\). According to the problem description, the program should output an array that has exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts. However, the current implementation only handles the cases where \(k = n\) (all cyclic shifts are sorted) or \(k = 1\) (only one cyclic shift is sorted). For any other value of \(k\), the program incorrectly outputs \(-1\), which is not always the correct answer.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 2
```
The expected output should be an array of length 4 with exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts. However, the program outputs \(-1\), which is incorrect. A correct output for this case could be:
```
1 2 3 1
```
This array has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: \([1, 2, 3, 1]\) and \([1, 1, 2, 3]\).
