Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, `n` is the length of `arr` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the frequency of the integer `i` in `arr`, `i` is 2. If `cou` is 2 or `freq[i]` is 0, `cou` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `freq[i]` is 1, `cou` is increased by 1.***
