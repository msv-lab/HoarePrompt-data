Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple and must have at least 1 tuple, `pos` is the first element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `bullets_used` is 0, `can_survive` is True, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is equal to `health`.**

The code snippet calculates the total number of bullets needed by adding the current `bullets_used` (which is 0) to the `health` of the first monster in the `monsters` list. Since `bullets_used` is 0, `total_bullets_needed` is simply equal to the `health` of the first monster. All other variables remain unchanged.
