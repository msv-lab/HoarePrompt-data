The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋.
- `a` is a list of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.

The function returns two lists, `l` and `r`, each of length 2k, where:
- `l` is a subset of the first half of `a`.
- `r` is a subset of the second half of `a`.
- The bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `r`.
