Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n` - 1 or `n` - 2, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. The current value of `k` is 0, and `sunks` is 1. The first element of `a` (at index `l`) is greater than the last element of `a` (at index `r`). `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`. Additionally, the current value of `k` is `a[r] * 2 - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
