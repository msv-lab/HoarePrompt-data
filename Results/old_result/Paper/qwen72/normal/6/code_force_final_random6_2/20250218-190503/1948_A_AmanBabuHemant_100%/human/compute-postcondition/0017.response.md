Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 49, inclusive, and is greater than 0; if `n` is odd, `n` remains an input integer and `s` is not defined; if `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is `n // 2 * 3` which is less than 200 if `n // 2 * 3` is less than 200, otherwise the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200.**
