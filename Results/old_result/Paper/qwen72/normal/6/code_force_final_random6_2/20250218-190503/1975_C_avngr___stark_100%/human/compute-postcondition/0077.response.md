Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **`t`**: An integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). This is the number of test cases.
2. **`n`**: An input integer where \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\). This is the length of the list `a`.
3. **`a`**: A list of integers derived from the input. The list has `n` elements.
4. **`i`**: Set to `n-3`. This means `i` is the index of the third-to-last element in the list `a`.
5. **`_`**: An integer that is less than `t` and incremented by 1. This variable is typically used in a loop to iterate over the test cases.
6. **`max`**: The maximum value of the middle element in any sorted sub-list of 3 consecutive elements in `a`.

The `print(max)` statement will print the maximum value of the middle element in any sorted sub-list of 3 consecutive elements in the list `a`.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **List `a`**: This list contains `n` integers. The exact values of these integers are not provided, but we know the list has at least 3 elements and at most \(10^5\) elements.
2. **Sub-lists of 3 consecutive elements**: We need to consider all sub-lists of 3 consecutive elements in `a`. For example, if `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the sub-lists are `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 4]`, and `[3, 4, 5]`.
3. **Sorting the sub-lists**: Each sub-list of 3 elements is sorted, and we are interested in the middle element of the sorted sub-list.
4. **Finding the maximum middle element**: We need to find the maximum value among all the middle elements of the sorted sub-lists.

### Example Calculation:

- Suppose `a = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]`.
  - Sub-lists: `[1, 3, 2]`, `[3, 2, 4]`, `[2, 4, 5]`.
  - Sorted sub-lists: `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 4]`, `[2, 4, 5]`.
  - Middle elements: 2, 3, 4.
  - Maximum middle element: 4.

### General Case:

Since the exact values of `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `max`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the `print(max)` statement will output the maximum value of the middle element in any sorted sub-list of 3 consecutive elements in `a`.

### Final Output:

Output: **max (where max is the maximum value of the middle element in any sorted sub-list of 3 consecutive elements in the list `a`)**
