Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the output for each test case. The `if ac > bc:` and `else:` blocks that print 'A' or 'B' are not indented within the for loop that iterates over the test cases. This means that the program will only print the result for the last test case, and not for each individual test case as required by the problem description. To fix this, the print statements should be indented to be inside the loop that processes each test case.
