Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `v` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - The first element of `v` is 0.
   - The remaining elements of `v` are integers provided by the user.
   - The element `v[v[i]]` is equal to `i`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `2`.
   - The values of `n`, `i`, and `v` do not affect the `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
