Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the length of the `array`.
   - `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), and all elements in `array` are distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - `find` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{find} \leq n\).
   - `l` is the smallest index in `array` such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`, or `l` is `n` if `find` is greater than all elements in `array`.
   - `r` is the largest index in `array` such that `array[r]` is less than `find`, or `r` is `-1` if `find` is less than or equal to all elements in `array`.
   - Additionally, `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(0)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print(0)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.
   - The value `0` is a constant and will be printed as is.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print(0)` statement will print the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
