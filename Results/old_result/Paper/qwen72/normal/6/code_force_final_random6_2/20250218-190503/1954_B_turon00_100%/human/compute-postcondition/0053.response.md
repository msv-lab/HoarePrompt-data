Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new list `a`, and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 3 if `a[i-1]` is also equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 1, and `ans` is `n` if `a[i-1]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and 1. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and 0.***
