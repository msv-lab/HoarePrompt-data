The function does not take any parameters, but it reads input values for n, m, k, and d, where n is the number of rows in the river grid, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges to build, and d is the maximum distance between supports. It also reads n rows of m integers each, representing the depths of the river cells. The values are such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m, with the first and last columns having a depth of 0.
