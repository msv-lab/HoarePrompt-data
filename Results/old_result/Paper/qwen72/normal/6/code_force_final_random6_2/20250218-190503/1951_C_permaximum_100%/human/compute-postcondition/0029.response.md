Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. It returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, where the cost of each ticket is determined by the initial prices of `n` items, and the price of each item increases by the number of tickets bought so far. After the function concludes, `total_cost` will be the sum of the costs of all `k` tickets bought, and the heap `pq` will be empty or contain only items with prices higher than those of the tickets already bought. **
