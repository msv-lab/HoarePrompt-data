Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` can be any integer from 1 to 10,000.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0. This means `n` is a positive integer.
- The function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `a` is a list of characters read from input.
- `b` is a list of characters read from input.
- `_` is incremented by 1 if the second-to-last character of `b` is not '<', otherwise `_` is unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print('Yes')` statement is a simple print statement that prints the string 'Yes'.
- The initial state and the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `_` do not affect the output of this print statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables or their values.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will always print the string 'Yes' regardless of the values of the variables in the initial state.

Output: **Yes**
