Output State: **`total` is 45, `i` is 11, `n` must be greater than or equal to 11, `values` is a list of integers with the specified values, `sum_values` is a list of integers with the specified values, `word` is '11', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 1, `values[10]` is `values[0] + values[1]`, `values[11]` is `values[1] + values[1]`, `sum_values[10]` is `values[10] + sum_values[9]`, `sum_values[11]` is `values[11] + sum_values[10]`, `sum_total` is `values[11] + sum_values[10]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `sum_values[i] = sum_total` updates the value at index `i` in the list `sum_values` to be equal to `sum_total`.
- Given `i` is 11, `sum_values[11]` is now set to `sum_total`.
- The value of `sum_total` is `values[11] + sum_values[10]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
