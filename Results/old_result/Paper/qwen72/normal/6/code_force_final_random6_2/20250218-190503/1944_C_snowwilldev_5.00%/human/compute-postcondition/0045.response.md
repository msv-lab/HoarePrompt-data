The objects in the loop head are `i` and `N`. The loop will execute if `N` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` is set to `N-1`, but for the loop to execute, `i` needs to start from 0, as `range(N)` generates a sequence from 0 to `N-1`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `i` should be 0 and `N` must be greater than 0.

State: **`N` remains the same, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`, `t` is 0**
