Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed and must have at least one element, `res` is 1, `_` is less than `t`, `n` is an input integer, and the current value of `a[i]` is 0.**

The value of `res` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
