Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1. If `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1) > 0`, then `x` is set to `a`. Otherwise, `x` remains 0.***
