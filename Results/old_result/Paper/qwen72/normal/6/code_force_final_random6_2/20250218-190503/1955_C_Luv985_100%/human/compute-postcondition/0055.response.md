Output State: **`T` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 10^4) decreased by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 1), `k` is `k - (2 * mi)`, `a` is a list of integers representing the input split by spaces, `l` is 1 (or 2 if `a[l]` was 0), `r` is `n - 1` (or `n - 2` if `a[r]` is 0), `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `ans` is `ans + 1`.**
