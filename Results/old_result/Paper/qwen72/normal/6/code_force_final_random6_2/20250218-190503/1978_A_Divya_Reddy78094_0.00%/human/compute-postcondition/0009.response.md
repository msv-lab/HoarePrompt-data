Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**

The code `nums.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `nums` in descending order. Since the list `nums` was already provided as sorted in descending order, the list remains unchanged. The other variables (`t`, `_`, and `n`) are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
