Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) and converts it to 12-hour format, appending 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour. The function prints the converted time and the corresponding 'AM' or 'PM' for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves `n` as 0, and `day` as 'AM' or 'PM' based on the last processed time, with `h` and `m` holding the last processed hour and minute values, respectively. The function does not return any value. **
