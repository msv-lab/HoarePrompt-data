The only objects in the loop head are the list `numbers` and the variable `num`. The loop iterates over the elements of `numbers` starting from the second element. At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was the third element in the list `numbers`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `numbers[1:]` must be the fourth element in the list `numbers`. Therefore, `num` should now be the fourth element in the list `numbers`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k` is a list of n integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the first element in the list `k`, the second element in the list `numbers`, and the third element in the list `numbers`, `numbers` is a list with at least 4 elements, `num` is the fourth element in the list `numbers`.**
