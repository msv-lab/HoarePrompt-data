Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `x` is less than `y`, `x` is not equal to `y`, `x` is less than `lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list with `lit[i]` appended to it. Otherwise, the state of `b` remains unchanged.***
