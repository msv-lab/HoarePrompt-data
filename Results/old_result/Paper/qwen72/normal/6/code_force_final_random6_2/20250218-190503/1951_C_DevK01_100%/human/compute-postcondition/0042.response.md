Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `L` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is `L[0]`, `m` is `L[1]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, and if `n * m == k`, then `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to `L[0]`, `L[1]`, and `L[2]` respectively.
- The initial state of `t`, `_`, `L`, and `M` remains unchanged.
- The value of `q` is still the ceiling of `k / m`.
- The conditions for the list `N` and the calculation of `cost` remain the same based on the updated values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
