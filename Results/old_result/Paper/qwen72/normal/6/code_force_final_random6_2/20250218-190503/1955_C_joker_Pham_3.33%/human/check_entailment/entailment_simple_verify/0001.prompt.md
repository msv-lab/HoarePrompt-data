You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the first and last ship, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of ships sunk.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `k` becomes zero, the loop breaks, as no more attacks can be made.

4. **Single Ship Case**:
   - If `l` equals `r`, it means there is only one ship left.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of this ship, the ship is sunk, and the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, the loop breaks without sinking the ship.

5. **Multiple Ships Case**:
   - If the durability of the first ship `a[l]` is less than or equal to the durability of the last ship `a[r]`:
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to twice the durability of the first ship, the first ship is sunk, and the durability of the last ship is reduced by the first ship's durability.
     - If the last ship's durability becomes zero, it is also sunk, and the pointer `r` is moved left.
     - The pointer `l` is moved right, and the number of sunk ships is incremented.
     - If `k` is exactly one less than twice the durability of the first ship, the first ship is sunk, and the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, the loop breaks without sinking any more ships.
   - If the durability of the last ship `a[r]` is less than the durability of the first ship `a[l]`:
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to twice the durability of the last ship, the last ship is sunk, and the durability of the first ship is reduced by the last ship's durability.
     - If the first ship's durability becomes zero, it is also sunk, and the pointer `l` is moved right.
     - The pointer `r` is moved left, and the number of sunk ships is incremented.
     - If `k` is exactly one less than twice the durability of the last ship, the last ship is sunk, and the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, the loop breaks without sinking any more ships.

6. **Output**:
   - The function returns the number of ships sunk, which is printed for each test case.

### Issues:
- The logic for handling the attacks is complex and can be simplified.
- The conditions for breaking the loop are not always clear, which can lead to incorrect results in certain edge cases.

### Simplified Approach:
- The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ship.
- We can simulate the attacks by decrementing the durability of the ships and keeping track of the number of sunk ships.
- If a ship's durability reaches zero, it is removed from the list, and the pointers are adjusted accordingly.

### Correctness:
- The given program does not correctly handle all edge cases and can produce incorrect results.
- For example, the logic for decrementing `k` and adjusting the pointers is not consistent and can lead to incorrect calculations.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program needs to be revised to ensure it correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and handles all edge cases.
