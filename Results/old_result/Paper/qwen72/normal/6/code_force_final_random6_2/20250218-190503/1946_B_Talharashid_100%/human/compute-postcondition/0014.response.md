Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers from the input split by a space that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, `c` and `maxi` remain 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.
- If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, `c` and `maxi` remain 0, so `maxi` does not change.
- Otherwise, `c` is set to `ele`, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` (which is now `ele`) and 0.
- The values of `int(input())`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `ele` remain unchanged.
- The value of `maxi` is updated based on the conditions described.
