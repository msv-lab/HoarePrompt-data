To determine the adjusted state for the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
```

This loop iterates over `d` starting from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `d` is `n - 1`.
- `path` is a list that may contain the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0.
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive) except `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0.
- `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`.
- If `v` is 0, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `d`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `d` is greater than or equal to 0.
3. **Current State**:
   - `d` is `n - 1`.
   - The loop will execute again if `d` is decremented by 1 and still greater than or equal to 0.

### Adjusted State for the Next Iteration:
- `d` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `d` is `n - 2`.
- The loop will execute again if `n - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 2`, `path` is a list that may contain the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive) except `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.**
