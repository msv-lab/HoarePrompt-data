Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 1, `sunks` remains 0, `k` is now `k` - `a[l] * 2`, and `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]`. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is updated to `n` - 2 and `sunks` is set to 1.**
