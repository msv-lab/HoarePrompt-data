You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 5000`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads another integer `n` (where `1 <= n <= 50`) and a list of `2n` integers (each between `1` and `10^7`). The function then processes each list by repeatedly removing the two smallest elements and adding the smaller of the two to a running sum until the list has 2 or fewer elements remaining. The final sum for each test case is appended to a list `ans_f`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function prints each element of `ans_f`. The final state of the program is that `ans_f` is a list of `t` integers, and the input has been fully consumed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of 2n integers.

2. **List Splitting and Conversion**: The program reads the list of integers as a single string and splits it into a list of strings. It then iterates over the list to convert these strings to integers and perform the operations.

3. **Score Calculation**: The program aims to calculate the maximum score by repeatedly selecting the minimum of two integers and adding it to the score. However, the way it selects and removes elements from the list is flawed.

4. **Element Removal**: The program uses `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` to remove elements. This is incorrect because:
   - `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` are always 0 and 2, respectively, regardless of the iteration.
   - This means the program will always remove the first and third elements, which is not the intended behavior.

5. **Correct Approach**: To maximize the score, the optimal strategy is to sort the list of integers and then pair the smallest elements together. This ensures that the minimum value in each pair is as large as possible.

6. **Sorting and Pairing**: The program should sort the list and then iterate over the sorted list, adding the minimum of each pair to the score. Since the list is sorted, the minimum of each pair will always be the first element in the pair.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
        lst.sort()
        ans = sum(lst[i] for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2))
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for ans in ans_f:
        print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Sorting**: The list `lst` is sorted in ascending order.
- **Pairing**: The program iterates over the sorted list, taking every second element (which is the minimum of each pair in the sorted list) and adds it to the score.
- **Output**: The final score for each test case is appended to `ans_f` and printed at the end.

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning above, the original program is incorrect due to the flawed element removal logic. The corrected program, however, is correct and will produce the desired output.

Correctness: **False**
