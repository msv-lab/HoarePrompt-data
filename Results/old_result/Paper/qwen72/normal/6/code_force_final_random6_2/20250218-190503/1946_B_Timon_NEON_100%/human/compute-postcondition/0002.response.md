Functionality: ** The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `number` and `quantity`, where `number` is an integer and `quantity` is a non-negative integer. It returns a single integer value, which is always 0, regardless of the input parameters. The function does not modify the input parameters and has no side effects. **
