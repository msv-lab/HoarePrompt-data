To determine what will be printed by the `print(t)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` and `y` are integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `a` is the integer value of the first part of the input string.
   - `b` is the integer value of the second part of the input string.
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If `t1` >= `a`, `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `t1` < `a`, `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
   - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`.
   - Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.

2. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - **Calculate `t1`:**
     \[
     t1 = t \times 15 - b \times 4
     \]
   - **Check the condition for `t1`:**
     - If `t1` >= `a`, `t` remains unchanged.
     - If `t1` < `a`, proceed to calculate `t2`.
   - **Calculate `t2` if `t1` < `a`:**
     \[
     t2 = a - t1
     \]
   - **Update `t` based on `t2`:**
     - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then:
       \[
       t = t + \left\lfloor \frac{a - t1}{15} \right\rfloor
       \]
     - Otherwise:
       \[
       t = t + \left\lfloor \frac{a - t1}{15} \right\rfloor + 1
       \]

3. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `t` will be printed. The exact value of `t` depends on the initial value of `t` and the values of `a` and `b` from the input string.

Since the exact values of `t`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the final value of `t` based on the given conditions.

Output: **t (where t is the updated value based on the conditions described in the initial state)**
