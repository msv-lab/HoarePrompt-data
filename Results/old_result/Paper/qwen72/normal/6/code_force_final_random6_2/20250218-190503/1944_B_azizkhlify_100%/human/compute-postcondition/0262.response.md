Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in the range `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in the range `n` to `2 * n - 1`) is incremented by 1, `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` (from the first `n` elements) that were equal to 2 in `l` and were reset to 0, `ur` and `re` remain 0, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`, `k` is not zero, and the element at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is 1.**
