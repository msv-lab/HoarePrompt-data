Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `A` is an integer, `B` is an integer, `C` is an integer, and `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`. If `A` is even, no additional changes are made. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.***
