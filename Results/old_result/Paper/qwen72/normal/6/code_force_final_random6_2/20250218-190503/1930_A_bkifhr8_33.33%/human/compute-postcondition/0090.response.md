Output State: **`i` is `n * 2 - 1`, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `t` is greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list that includes the final value of `ans`. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of the first two elements of `lst` (converted to integers) for each iteration, and elements at positions 0, 2, 4, ..., `n * 2 - 2` have been removed from `lst`. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` and `lst` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n * 2` times.
- After each iteration, `ans` is incremented by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` (converted to integers).
- The first and third elements of `lst` are removed in each iteration, which means elements at positions 0, 2, 4, ..., `n * 2 - 2` are removed.
- The loop stops if `lst` has exactly 2 elements, and `ans` is incremented by the minimum of these two elements.
- The final value of `i` is `n * 2 - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n * 2 - 1` (inclusive).
- `n` and `t` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `ans_f` is a list that includes the final value of `ans` after the loop completes.
