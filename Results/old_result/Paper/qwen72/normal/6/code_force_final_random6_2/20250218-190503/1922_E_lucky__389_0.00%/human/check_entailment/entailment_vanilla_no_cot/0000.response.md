Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all given test cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Count Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to construct an array by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible power of 2 from `x` and appending the corresponding index to `subseq_lens`. However, this approach does not correctly account for the number of increasing subsequences.
   - For example, for `x = 5`, the program should output an array that has exactly 5 increasing subsequences. However, the program outputs `2 2 3 4 2`, which does not have exactly 5 increasing subsequences.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where `x` is a power of 2 correctly. For example, for `x = 2`, the program outputs `1 0`, which is not a valid array since it does not have exactly 2 increasing subsequences.

3. **Subsequence Construction**:
   - The program constructs the array by appending the indices from `subseq_lens` to `ansv`, but this does not ensure that the array has the required number of increasing subsequences. The elements in `ansv` should be chosen in a way that guarantees the correct number of increasing subsequences.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to construct an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. One way to do this is to use a combination of repeated elements and unique elements to control the number of increasing subsequences.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(x):
    if x == 1:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    # Start with a base array that has 1 increasing subsequence
    arr = [1]
    
    # We need to add elements to the array to get exactly X increasing subsequences
    while x > 1:
        # Find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to x
        i = int(math.log2(x))
        # Add a new element that will create 2^i new increasing subsequences
        arr.append(2 + i)
        # Subtract the number of new subsequences from x
        x -= 2 ** i
    
    print(len(arr))
    print(*arr)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        func_1(x)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Base Case**: If `x` is 1, it is impossible to construct an array with exactly 1 increasing subsequence (since the empty subsequence is always counted), so we print `-1`.
- **Array Construction**: We start with a base array `[1]` which has 1 increasing subsequence. We then repeatedly add elements to the array to create the required number of increasing subsequences.
- **Power of 2 Calculation**: For each `x > 1`, we find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x` and add a new element to the array that will create exactly `2^i` new increasing subsequences. We then subtract `2^i` from `x` and continue until `x` is 1.
- **Output**: The program prints the length of the constructed array and the array itself.

This approach ensures that the array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences for any valid input `X`.
