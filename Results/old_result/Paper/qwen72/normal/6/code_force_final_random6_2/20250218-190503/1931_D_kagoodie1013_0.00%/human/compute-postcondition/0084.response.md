Output State: **`test_cases` list must have at least 3 tuples, the `(n, x, y, arr)` tuple is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `results` list now contains two elements, where the first element is the final value of `count` before the execution of the code, and the second element is the same final value of `count`, `count` is now the sum of the final value of `count` before the execution of the code, 2, and 2, `mod_x_map` is no longer an empty dictionary and contains the key `mod_x_key` with the value 2, `mod_y_map` is no longer an empty dictionary and contains the key `mod_y_key` with the value 2, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y`.**

In natural language: The `test_cases` list still has at least 3 tuples, and the third tuple is `(n, x, y, arr)`. The `arr` list still has at least 3 elements, and `num` is the third element of `arr`. The `results` list still contains two elements, both of which are the final value of `count` before the code was executed. The `count` variable is now updated to be the sum of its previous value, 2 from `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)`, and 2 from `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`. The `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` dictionaries are unchanged and still contain the keys `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` with values 2. The `mod_x` and `mod_y` variables are still equal to `-num % x` and `num % y` respectively, and `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` are still equal to `num % x` and `num % y` respectively.
