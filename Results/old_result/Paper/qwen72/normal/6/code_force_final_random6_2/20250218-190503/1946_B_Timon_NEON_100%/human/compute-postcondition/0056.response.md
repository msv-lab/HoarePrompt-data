Output State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list if the last element of `arr` is negative, otherwise it is `[sum of all non-negative elements from the last segment, index of the last non-negative element]`. `max_segment` is `[sum of the maximum segment of non-negative elements, starting index of the maximum segment]`. `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a segment of non-negative elements, the starting index of the segment, and the ending index of the segment, with the last element being `max_segment` followed by `len(arr) - 1`. The `new_segment` list is appended to `segments_variants` with the ending index `len(arr) - 1`. `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `total_max_segment = [-1]` initializes the variable `total_max_segment` to a list containing a single element, which is `-1`.
- All other variables (`i`, `max_sum`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
- The initial state is preserved, and the only new information is the value of `total_max_segment`.
