Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `_` is a placeholder variable (its value is not relevant to the problem).
   - `n` is the first integer read from the input line.
   - `k` is the second integer read from the input line.
   - `n` is equal to `k`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer value `1`.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this specific print statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The print statement will always output the integer `1` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Output: **1**
