Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not always calculate the minimum possible penalty correctly. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
5 4 3 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Actual Output:**
```
4
```

In this case, the optimal way to split the array is to put all elements into one subsequence (either `s` or `t`). Since the array is already in descending order, there are no indices `i` where `b_i < b_{i + 1}`, so the penalty should be 0. However, the program incorrectly distributes the elements between `s` and `t`, leading to a penalty of 4.

The logic in the program for deciding which subsequence to append the current element to is flawed. It does not always ensure that the penalty is minimized. Specifically, the conditions for appending to `a` or `b` do not consider the optimal way to minimize the penalty.
