### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing elements from an array `a`.
   - Alice appends the chosen element to an array `c` and then removes it from `a`.
   - Bob removes the chosen element from `a` but does not append it to `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The score of the game is the MEX of the array `c`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the score, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX.
   - If both players play optimally, the MEX of `c` will be determined by the smallest element that appears fewer than twice in `a`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It iterates through the elements from 0 to `N-1` and checks the count of each element.
   - If an element appears exactly once, it increments a counter `t`.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or an element does not appear at all, it prints the current index `i` and breaks the loop.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It correctly identifies the smallest element that either appears fewer than twice or does not appear at all.
   - The logic of breaking the loop when `t` reaches 2 or when an element does not appear at all is correct because it ensures that the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `c` after both players have played optimally.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all elements are the same (e.g., `[1, 1, 1, 1]`), correctly outputting 0.
   - It also handles the case where the array `a` is empty, which is not possible given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob and will output the correct MEX for the array `c` after the game ends.

Correctness: **True**
