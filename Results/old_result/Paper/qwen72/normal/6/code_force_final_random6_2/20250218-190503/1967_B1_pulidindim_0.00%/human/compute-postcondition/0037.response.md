Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n`, `countmins` is 1, and `g` is equal to `n / m - (m - 1)`.**

Explanation: The value of `countmins` is updated to `count - 1`. Since `count` is 2, `countmins` becomes 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
