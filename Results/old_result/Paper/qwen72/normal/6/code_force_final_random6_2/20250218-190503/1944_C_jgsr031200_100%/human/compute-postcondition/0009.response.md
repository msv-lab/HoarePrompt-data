To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized by the `range(n + 1)` function, which means it will start at 0 and increment by 1 until it reaches `n` (not inclusive of `n + 1`).
2. **Variable `n`**: This variable must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once. Given that `n` is the length of `arr` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, `n` is already a positive integer, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `i` starts at 0, which is the default behavior of `range(n + 1)`.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, `n` is the length of `arr` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the frequency of the integer `i` in `arr`, `cou` is 0, `i` is 0**
