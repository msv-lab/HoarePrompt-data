Output State: **`t` remains the input string, `ii` is 0, `n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the input, `a` is the input list of integers, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `k` is the final value after all iterations, `q1` is the final value after all iterations, `q2` is the final value after all iterations, and `y` is a list of `n` elements where each element from index 0 to `n-2` is the updated value of `k` at each iteration, and the last element is the final value of `k`.**

Explanation:
- The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n` and `m` based on the input provided.
- The input is split into two parts, and each part is converted to an integer using `map(int, ...)`.
- The values of `n` and `m` are now positive integers provided by the input.
- The other variables (`t`, `ii`, `a`, `l`, `k`, `q1`, `q2`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
