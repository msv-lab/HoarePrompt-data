Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `dp` is a list with three elements: [3, 7, 17], `i` is 4**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `dp`. The new element is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`. Given the initial state, `dp[-1]` is 7, `dp[-2]` is 3, and `i` is 4. The calculation is:

- `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)` 
- `= (7 + 2 * (4 - 1) * 3) % 1000000007`
- `= (7 + 2 * 3 * 3) % 1000000007`
- `= (7 + 18) % 1000000007`
- `= 25 % 1000000007`
- `= 25`

So, the new element appended to `dp` is 25, and the updated `dp` list is [3, 7, 17]. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the constraint on `n` still holds.
