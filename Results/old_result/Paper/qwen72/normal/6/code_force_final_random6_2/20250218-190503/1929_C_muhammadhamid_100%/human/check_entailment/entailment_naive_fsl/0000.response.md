Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum number of coins required to guarantee winning any number of coins is flawed.

The program calculates `s` as follows:
```python
s = 1
for i in range(x):
    s += s // (k - 1) + 1
```

This logic is intended to simulate the minimum number of coins required to ensure that Sasha can recover from `x` consecutive losses. However, it does not correctly account for the fact that after `x` consecutive losses, Sasha must still have enough coins to place a bet and potentially win back his losses.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
3 2 1
```
- `k = 3` (win multiplier)
- `x = 2` (maximum consecutive losses)
- `a = 1` (initial coins)

According to the program:
- `s = 1`
- After the first iteration: `s += 1 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`
- After the second iteration: `s += 2 // (3 - 1) + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4`

The program will output `No` because `a = 1` is less than `s = 4`.

However, the correct answer should be `Yes` because:
- If Sasha bets 1 coin and wins, he will have 3 coins.
- If Sasha loses the first bet, he will have 0 coins, but he can't lose again because he has no coins left.
- If Sasha wins the first bet, he will have 3 coins, and he can continue betting to increase his coins.

The program fails to correctly simulate the scenario where Sasha can still guarantee winning any number of coins even if he starts with a small number of coins. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
