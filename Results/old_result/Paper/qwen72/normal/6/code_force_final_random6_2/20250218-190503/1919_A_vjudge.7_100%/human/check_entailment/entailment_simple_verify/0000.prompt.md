You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

    1000000000 1000000000

Output

    Bob
    Alice

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two integers a and b as input, where 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `test` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and `t` is `test - 1`. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the condition holds. If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the condition also holds.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program contains a logical error in the condition used to determine the winner. Specifically, the condition `if a + b & 1 == 0:` is incorrect. The bitwise AND operator `&` has higher precedence than the equality operator `==`, so the expression `a + b & 1 == 0` is evaluated as `(a + (b & 1)) == 0`, which is not the intended logic.

The correct condition should be `if (a + b) % 2 == 0:` to check if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins. This is because the game essentially reduces to a parity problem where the player who starts with an odd number of total coins will always win if both players play optimally.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:
```python
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

Case where the program fails:
For the input:
```
1
1 1
```
The program will incorrectly output `Alice` instead of `Bob` because `1 + 1 & 1 == 0` evaluates to `True`, which is incorrect. The correct condition should be `(1 + 1) % 2 == 0`, which evaluates to `True`, and thus the correct output should be `Bob`.
