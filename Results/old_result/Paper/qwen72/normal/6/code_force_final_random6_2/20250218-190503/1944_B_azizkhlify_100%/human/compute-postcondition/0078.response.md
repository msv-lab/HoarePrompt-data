Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is a list that must contain at least three elements.
- `i` is the third element in `res`.

The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the third element of the list `res` and will not move to a new line after printing (due to `end=' '`).

Since the exact values of the elements in `res` are not provided, the output will be the third element of `res` followed by a space.

Output: **[i] (where [i] is the third element of the list `res`)**
