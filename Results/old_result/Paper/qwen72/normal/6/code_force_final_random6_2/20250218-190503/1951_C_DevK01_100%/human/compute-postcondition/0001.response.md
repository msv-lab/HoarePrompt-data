The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted; it will be assigned values from 0 to `t-1` by the `range(t)` function.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0 (the first value in the range)**

This adjustment ensures that the loop will execute at least once, given the constraints that `t` is at least 1.
