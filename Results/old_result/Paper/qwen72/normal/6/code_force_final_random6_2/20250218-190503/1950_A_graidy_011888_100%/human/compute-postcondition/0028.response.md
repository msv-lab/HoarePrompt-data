Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user input. It then checks the relationship between these integers and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b` and `b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value but affects the program state by reading input and printing output based on the conditions. **
