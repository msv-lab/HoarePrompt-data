Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `steps` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `c` and `d` are new integers provided by the user input, `e` and `f` are new integers provided by the user input, `g` and `h` are integers provided by the user input, `n` is equal to (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f), and `x` is equal to (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h). If `x` > `n`, the current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `e` and `f` are updated to new integers provided by the user input.
- The values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `g`, and `h` remain unchanged.
- The expressions for `n` and `x` are still valid, but they now use the new values of `e` and `f` for `n`.
- The condition comparing `x` and `n` remains the same, but it will be evaluated with the new values of `e` and `f`.
