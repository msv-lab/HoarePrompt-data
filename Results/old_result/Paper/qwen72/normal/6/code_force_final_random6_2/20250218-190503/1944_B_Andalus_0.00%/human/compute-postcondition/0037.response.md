The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 3).

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `rdb` contains the element `rgt[2]`. Otherwise, `rdb` remains an empty list.**
