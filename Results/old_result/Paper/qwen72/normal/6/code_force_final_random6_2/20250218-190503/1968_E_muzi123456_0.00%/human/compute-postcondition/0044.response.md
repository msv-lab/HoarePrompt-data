The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters in its definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function will handle a number of test cases `t` where `1 <= t <= 50`, and for each test case, an integer `n` where `2 <= n <= 10^3`. The function is expected to return results for each of these test cases, but the specific output for each case is not provided in the constraints.

Functionality: **The function handles a number of test cases `t` (1 to 50) and for each test case, an integer `n` (2 to 1000), and returns results for each test case.**
