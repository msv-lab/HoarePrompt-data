Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

**Initial State:**
- `res` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements.
- `i` is the third element of `res`.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**
1. **List `res`:** The list `res` is described as having at least 3 elements. This means `res` could be something like `[a, b, c, ...]` where `a`, `b`, and `c` are the first, second, and third elements, respectively.
2. **Variable `i`:** According to the initial state, `i` is the third element of `res`. Therefore, `i` is `res[2]`.
3. **Print Statement:** The `print` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Since `i` is the third element of `res`, the output will be the value of the third element of `res` followed by a space.

**Final Output:**
Output: **[res[2]] (where [res[2]] is the third element of the list `res`)**
