The provided Python code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides some conditions about the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`:
  - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t < 1000\).
  - `n` is the first integer read from the input line.
  - `k` is the second integer read from the input line.
  - The relationship between `n` and `k` is such that if `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`, and the relationship between `n + 2` and `k * 2` is such that either `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2` or `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

- The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It will always print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
