Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `s` is the first 3 characters of `a` if `i` was 1, otherwise `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2`. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1. `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `s = a[i:i + 3]` updates the value of `s` to be the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2`.
- If `i` was 1, then `s` becomes the first 3 characters of `a`.
- If `i` was 3, then `s` becomes the substring of `a` starting from index 3 and ending at index 5.
- The conditions for `ans` and `i` remain the same as in the initial state.
- The condition that `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2` remains valid.
