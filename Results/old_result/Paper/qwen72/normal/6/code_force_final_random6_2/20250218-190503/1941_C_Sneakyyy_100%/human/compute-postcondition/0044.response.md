The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was either 1 or 3, depending on whether `s` was 'map' or 'pie'. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be either 2 or 4. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `a` is the new input string and `len(a)` must be greater than 5, `s` is the substring of `a` starting at index `i-1` and ending at index `i + 2`. If `s` was 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2.**
