Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. The logic in the program only counts the combinations of sticks with the same lengths, which is insufficient for solving the problem.

For a non-degenerate triangle, the triangle inequality theorem must be satisfied: the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. However, the lengths of the sticks are powers of 2, which means that for three sticks with lengths \(2^{a_i}\), \(2^{a_j}\), and \(2^{a_k}\) (where \(a_i \le a_j \le a_k\)), the only way they can form a non-degenerate triangle is if \(a_i = a_j = a_k\). This is because \(2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}\) only holds true when \(a_i = a_j = a_k\).

The program should count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks with the same length, but it also incorrectly adds combinations where two sticks have the same length and one stick has a different length, which is not valid for forming a non-degenerate triangle.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        v = [0] * (n + 1)
        for _ in range(n):
            x = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            v[x] += 1
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if v[i] >= 3:
                ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
        results.append(str(ans))
    print('\n'.join(results))
```

This corrected version only counts the combinations where all three sticks have the same length, which is the only valid way to form a non-degenerate triangle with sticks of lengths that are powers of 2.
