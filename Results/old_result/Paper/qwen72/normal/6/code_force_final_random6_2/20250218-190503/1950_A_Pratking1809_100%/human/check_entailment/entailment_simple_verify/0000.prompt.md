You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input, `q` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and `i` is `q - 1`. For each iteration, if `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b` which is less than `c`. If `a < b < c` is not true, then the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` does not satisfy `a < b < c`. If `a < b > c` is true, then `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`. If `a < b > c` is false, then the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` does not satisfy `a < b > c`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles all potential cases according to the problem description. It checks for the conditions of a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`), and outputs "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" accordingly. The program also correctly processes the input format, reading the number of test cases and then processing each test case individually. No edge cases or missing logic have been identified that would cause the program to fail.
