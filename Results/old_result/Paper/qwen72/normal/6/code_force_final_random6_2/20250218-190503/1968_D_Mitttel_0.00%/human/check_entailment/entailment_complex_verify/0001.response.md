### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (func_2):**
   - The function `func_2` reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through the test cases, extracting the necessary values for each test case and calling `func_1` to determine the winner.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases and ensures that the input is processed correctly.
   - **Annotation Validation:** The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call, including the correct extraction and processing of input data.

2. **Score Calculation (calculate_score):**
   - The function `calculate_score` calculates the score for a player starting from a given position.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to keep track of the positions visited and the step at which they were visited. This helps in detecting cycles.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by:
     - Determining the cycle length and the score for one full cycle.
     - Adding the score for the full cycles and the remaining steps after the cycles.
   - If no cycle is detected, it simply continues to add the score for each step until `k` steps are reached.
   - **Annotation Validation:** The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points within the function, including the detection of cycles and the calculation of scores for both cyclic and non-cyclic scenarios.

3. **Game Logic (func_1):**
   - The function `func_1` calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha to get their final scores.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate result: "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".
   - **Annotation Validation:** The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call, including the comparison of scores and the return of the correct result.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Cycle Detection:**
  - The `calculate_score` function correctly detects cycles using the `visited` dictionary. When a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps efficiently by leveraging the cycle length and score.
  - This is crucial because the game can last up to \(10^9\) turns, and without cycle detection, the function would be too slow.
  - **Annotation Validation:** The annotations correctly describe the cycle detection process and the state of the program after detecting a cycle.

- **Score Calculation:**
  - The score is calculated correctly by adding the value of `a` at the current position for each step.
  - The function handles both the case where the player stays at the same position and the case where the player moves to the next position in the permutation.
  - **Annotation Validation:** The annotations correctly describe the score calculation process, including the handling of cycles and the final score computation.

- **Input and Output:**
  - The input handling in `func_2` is efficient and correctly processes the input for multiple test cases.
  - The output is generated correctly for each test case.
  - **Annotation Validation:** The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after processing each test case, ensuring that the input and output are handled as expected.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct and handles the problem as described. It efficiently detects cycles and calculates the scores for both players, ensuring that the game logic is followed accurately.

### Correctness:
