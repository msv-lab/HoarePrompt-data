### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `num` itself.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The function checks if all elements in the array are already the same by iterating through the array and comparing each element with the next one. If they are all the same, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because no operation is needed if all elements are already equal.

3. **Consecutive Identical Elements**:
   - The function then calculates the maximum number of consecutive identical elements from the start of the array (`cn`) and from the end of the array (`ck`).
   - It does this by iterating through the array from the start and the end, counting the number of consecutive identical elements until it encounters a different element.

4. **Combining Counts**:
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same, it adds the counts `ck` to `cn`. This is because if the first and last elements are the same, we can potentially extend the count of identical elements by combining the counts from both ends.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints `n - max(cn, ck)` for each test case. This is the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal, as it represents the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array uniform.

### Analysis of the Execution Summary:
- The function processes the input correctly and handles the edge case where all elements are already the same.
- The logic for calculating the maximum number of consecutive identical elements from the start and end of the array is sound.
- The final output `n - max(cn, ck)` is the correct approach to determine the minimum cost.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and computes the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
