Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.** 

The initial state specified that `n`, `m`, and `x` were integers within certain ranges, but after executing the code snippet, `n`, `m`, and `x` are now the values returned by the function `func_3()`. The specific values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are determined by the function `func_3()`, and they may or may not still fall within the original ranges.
