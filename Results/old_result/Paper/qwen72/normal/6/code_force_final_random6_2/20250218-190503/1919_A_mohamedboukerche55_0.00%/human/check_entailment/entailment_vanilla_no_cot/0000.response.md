Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks if the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd. However, the game's outcome depends on the specific values of `a` and `b` and the sequence of moves, not just their sum.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:

1. If both players have the same number of coins, the game will end in a tie, but since the problem states that the player who cannot make a valid move loses, the player who starts (Alice) will lose if the number of coins is the same.
2. If the number of coins is different, the player with more coins can always force the game to end in their favor by making strategic moves.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a, b = map(int, s.split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a > b:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This program correctly determines the winner based on the rules of the game. If Alice and Bob have the same number of coins, Bob wins because Alice will be the first to run out of moves. If Alice has more coins, she can always win by making strategic moves. If Bob has more coins, he can always win by making strategic moves.
