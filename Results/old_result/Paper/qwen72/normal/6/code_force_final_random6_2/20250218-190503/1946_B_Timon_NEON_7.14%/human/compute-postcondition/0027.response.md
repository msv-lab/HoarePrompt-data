Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and `arr` must have at least two elements. `i` is 1. `segments_variants` is a list that now includes the list `new_segment + [0]`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the list `new_segment` plus the value `[i - 1]` (which is `[0]` since `i` is 1) to the list `segments_variants`. The values of `arr` and `i` remain unchanged.
