Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n` - 1 or `n` - 2, and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. If `k` == 0, `sunks` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `l` == `r`. Otherwise, if `k` >= `2 * a[l]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[l]`. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is updated to `n` - 2 or `n` - 3. If `a[r]` is not 0, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l]`. If `k` < `2 * a[l]` or `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `l` == `r`.***
