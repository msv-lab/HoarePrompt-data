Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string and must have at least one element, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list with values [1, 0], `ans` is 0, `c` is the first element of `s` and is currently 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` checks if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0.
- `cnt[1]` is currently 0, so the condition `cnt[1] > 0` is false.
- Therefore, `ans` is not incremented and remains 0.
- The values of `n`, `s`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `c` remain unchanged.
