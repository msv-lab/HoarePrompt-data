The given `print` statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer between 0 and 49, inclusive, and is greater than 0.
   - If `n` is odd, `n` remains an input integer and `s` is not defined.
   - If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
   - The length of `s` is `n // 2 * 3` which is less than 200 if `n // 2 * 3` is less than 200, otherwise the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string 'YES'.
   - The values of `t` and `n` and the definition of `s` do not affect the output of this `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print 'YES' regardless of the values of `t` and `n` or the definition of `s`.

Output: **YES**
