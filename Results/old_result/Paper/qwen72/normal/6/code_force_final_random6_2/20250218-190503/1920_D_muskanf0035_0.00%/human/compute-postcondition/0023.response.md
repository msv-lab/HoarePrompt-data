Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a list of tuples with all tuples processed, `array` is a list that has been modified according to the operations in `operations`, `result` is a list containing the elements at indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`, `queries` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop executed.**

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `n` remains a positive integer.
- The `operations` list has been fully processed, and its state is unchanged.
- The `array` list has been modified according to the operations specified in `operations`.
- The `result` list now contains the elements from `array` at the indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in the `queries` list.
- The `queries` list must have at least as many elements as the number of times the loop executed. Each element `k` in `queries` was used to determine the index in `array` from which an element was appended to `result`.
