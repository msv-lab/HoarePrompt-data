Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; `a` is the integer value of the first part of the input string; `b` is the integer value of the second part of the input string; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `t2` is `a - t1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `t2 = a - t1` assigns the value of `a - t1` to `t2`. The value of `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, and `a` is the integer value of the first part of the input string. Therefore, `t2` is calculated as `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
