Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0. If `x` is greater than `y`, and `y` is infinity, `b` remains an empty list. If `y` is not infinity and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[0]`, `b` is a non-empty list containing the first element of `lit`, and `y` is the last element of `b` (which is `lit[0]`). If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` is a non-empty list with `lit[i]` appended to it, and `y` is the last element of `b` before the new append. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, if `a` was an empty list, `a` is now a list containing `lit[i]`, and `x` is `lit[i]`. If `a` was a non-empty list, `a` is a list with `lit[i]` appended to it, and `x` is `lit[i]`. `x` is always greater than `y` after the execution, unless the condition `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y` is not met, in which case the variables and lists remain unchanged. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, and `x` is equal to `y`, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, and `x` is the first element of `lit`, while `b` remains unchanged. If `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` is a non-empty list with the last element being `lit[i]`, and `x` is the last element of `a`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `b` is an empty list, `y` is infinity, and `a` is a non-empty list with the last element being `lit[i]`, and `x` is the last element of `a`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x`, `b` now contains the element `lit[i]`, and the new value of `y` is equal to `lit[i]`. In all cases, `x` is less than `y` unless the condition `x < y` is not met, in which case the original values of `x` and `y` are retained.***
