Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer provided by the user, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

The value of `n` is now updated to the integer provided by the user, while the other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
