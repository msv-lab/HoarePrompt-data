The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `array` and `find`. `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and all elements in `array` are distinct integers from 1 to `n`. `find` is an integer such that `1 <= find <= n`.

The function returns a list containing two strings:
- The first string is the smallest index `l` (plus 1) in `array` where `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`.
- The second string is the index of `find` in `array` (plus 1).

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `array` of distinct integers from 1 to n and an integer `find` within the same range. It returns a list of two strings: the first string is the smallest index (plus 1) where the element in `array` is greater than or equal to `find`, and the second string is the index (plus 1) of `find` in `array`.**
