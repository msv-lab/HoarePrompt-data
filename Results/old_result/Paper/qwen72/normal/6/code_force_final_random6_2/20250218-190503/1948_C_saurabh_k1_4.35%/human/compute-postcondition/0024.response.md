The function `func` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`. The integer `n` is an even number such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. Each string consists of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of a grid, respectively.

The function returns the number of columns in each test case where the arrows in the first and second rows are pointing in opposite directions.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, each containing an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. It returns the number of columns where the arrows in the first and second rows are pointing in opposite directions for each test case.**
