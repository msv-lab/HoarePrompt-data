Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `index` is increased by `n + 4`, `p` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` creates a new list `a` containing `n` integers starting from the position `index` in the `data` list up to `index + n - 1`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, and `index` remain unchanged from the initial state.
- The list `p` is still a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`.
- The new list `a` is created and contains `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`.
