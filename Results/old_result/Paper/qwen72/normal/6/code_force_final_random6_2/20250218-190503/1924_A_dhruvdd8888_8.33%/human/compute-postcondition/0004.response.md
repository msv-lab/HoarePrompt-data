Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `m` are assigned the values provided by the user input, and these values are integers. The constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26 are still valid. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, and `s` is now updated to the user input string. `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. `win` is an empty set. `ans` is an empty list.**
