### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `numCasos`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes `x` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total cost of bribes.
   - It iterates over the positions in the queue from the last person to the first person (`range(n - 1, -1, -1)`).
   - For each position `i`:
     - If `i` is less than `m`, it updates `pergunta` to be the minimum of its current value and the cost of moving to position `i` (`x + a[i]`).
     - It adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`. This step ensures that the cost of moving to position `i` is calculated correctly, considering the cost to bribe the person at position `i` and the cost to bribe each person between positions `j` and `i-1`.

3. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the function prints `pergunta`, which is the minimum cost required to move Kirill to a position less than `m`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output formats as specified.
- The logic for calculating the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position less than `m` is sound. The function iterates from the end of the queue to the beginning, ensuring that it considers the cost of moving to each position and the cumulative cost of bribes.
- The use of `min(pergunta, x + a[i])` ensures that the minimum cost is updated only when a valid move to a position less than `m` is found.
- The accumulation of `x` using `min(a[i], b[i])` is appropriate because it ensures that the cost of moving to position `i` is the minimum of the two possible costs.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The logic and the implementation are consistent with the requirements and constraints.
