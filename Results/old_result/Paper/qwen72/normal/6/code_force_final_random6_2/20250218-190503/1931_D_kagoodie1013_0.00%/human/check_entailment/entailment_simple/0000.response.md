Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes this list to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case, storing them in a list `test_cases`. This approach is efficient and correctly handles the input format.

2. **Test Case Structure**: Each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list `arr`. This structure is appropriate for the problem and matches the input description.

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The program initializes a `count` variable to zero for each test case.
   - It uses two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of `arr` are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
   - For each number `num` in `arr`, it calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y` as `-num % x` and `num % y`, respectively. It then increments `count` by the number of times the corresponding remainders have been seen in the arrays.
   - It updates the dictionaries with the actual remainders `num % x` and `num % y`.

4. **Output**: The program appends the final `count` for each test case to the `results` list and prints the results.

5. **Algorithmic Logic**:
   - The condition for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful is that \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by `x` and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by `y`.
   - The program uses the properties of modular arithmetic to check these conditions:
     - \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) implies \(-a_j \equiv a_i \pmod{x}\), which is why it uses `-num % x`.
     - \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) implies \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\), which is why it uses `num % y`.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program:
- The program incorrectly increments `count` by the number of times the remainders have been seen in the arrays before updating the dictionaries. This means it counts pairs where `i == j`, which is not allowed according to the problem statement (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n).

To fix this, the program should update the dictionaries before incrementing `count`:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        
        mod_x_map = {}
        mod_y_map = {}
        
        for num in arr:
            mod_x_key = num % x
            mod_y_key = num % y
            mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
            mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
            
            mod_x = -num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) - 1  # Subtract 1 to avoid counting the pair (i, i)
        
        results.append(count // 2)  # Each pair is counted twice, so divide by 2
        
    return results
```

With this correction, the program will correctly count the number of beautiful pairs without including pairs where `i == j`.

Correctness: **False** (due to the logical flaw in counting pairs where `i == j`).
