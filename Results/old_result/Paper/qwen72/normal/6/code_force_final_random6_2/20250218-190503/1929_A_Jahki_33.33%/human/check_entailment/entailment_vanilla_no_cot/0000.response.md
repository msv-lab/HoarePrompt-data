Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns `True`, and the program prints `0`. However, this is not the correct approach. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty after rearranging the elements, not just checking if the array is already sorted.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Beauty**:
   - The program calculates the beauty of the sorted array, which is not necessarily the maximum beauty. The maximum beauty is achieved by sorting the array in non-increasing order (i.e., in descending order) and then calculating the sum of the differences.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the beauty of the array, you should sort the array in descending order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    b = sorted(a, reverse=True)
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x - 1] - b[x]
    print(beauty)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and the array for each test case.
- **Sorting in Descending Order**: The array is sorted in descending order using `sorted(a, reverse=True)`.
- **Calculating Beauty**: The beauty is calculated by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
- **Output**: The maximum beauty is printed for each test case.

This approach ensures that the beauty is maximized, as the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted descending array will be the largest possible.
