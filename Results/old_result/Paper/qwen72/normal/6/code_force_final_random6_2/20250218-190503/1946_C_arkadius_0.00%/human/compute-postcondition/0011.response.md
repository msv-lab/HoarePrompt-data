Output State: **`n` is the same as in the initial state, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer read from the input, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` as its argument, and `n - 1` edges have been added to the `tree` instance, each connecting nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` where `u` and `v` are integers read from the input during each iteration.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` remains unchanged from its initial value. The variable `i` has reached the value `n - 1`, which is the last value it takes before the loop ends. The variable `k` is still the integer read from the input, and the `tree` instance, which was initialized with `n` nodes, now has `n - 1` edges added to it. Each edge was added based on the input values `u` and `v` provided during each iteration of the loop, connecting nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1`.
