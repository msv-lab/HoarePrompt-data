Postcondition: ***`s` is a string with at least three characters, `i` is the third character of `s`, and `func_1(s, n)` is defined with parameters `s` and `n` where `1 <= n <= 5000`. If `i` is '-', `neg` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `neg` remains 0 or 1 depending on whether the first character of `s` was '-' or not.***
