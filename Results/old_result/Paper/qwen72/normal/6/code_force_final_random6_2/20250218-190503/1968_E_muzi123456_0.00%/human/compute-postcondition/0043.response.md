Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the value of `t` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 for each iteration. The variable `n` will be the last input integer provided by the user for the final test case, and it must still be greater than or equal to 2. The variable `i` will be equal to the last value of `n` because the inner loop runs from 1 to `n` and `i` is incremented to `n` in the last iteration of the inner loop. All other variables that were not affected by the loop head or body will remain unchanged.
