Output State: **`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` where `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `T` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers, each element being the integer conversion of the corresponding user-provided input, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.
- The values of `l`, `r`, `k`, `T`, `a`, `mi`, and `ans` remain as they were in the initial state.
- The specific value of `a[r]` after the operation is `a[r] - mi`.
