Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\) and \(x \neq y\).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`, which is the absolute difference between the integers `n` and `m`.

Since `n` and `m` are input integers and their exact values are not provided, the value of `k` cannot be determined precisely. However, it is known that `k` is the result of the expression `abs(n - m)`.

Output: **k (where k is the absolute difference between the integers n and m)**
