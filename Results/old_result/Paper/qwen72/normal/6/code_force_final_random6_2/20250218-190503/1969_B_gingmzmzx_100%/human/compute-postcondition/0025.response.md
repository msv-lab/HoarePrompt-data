The only object in the loop head is the variable `n`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0. Since the loop variable `_` is not used, it does not affect the state.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the count of zeros in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the count of ones in `s`, `ans` is the sum of the number of zeros that appear after any one in the list `s`**
