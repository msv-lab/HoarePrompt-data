Output State: **`total` is 45, `i` is `n`, `n` is the last input integer, `values` is a list of integers where each value at index `i` is the sum of the values at the indices corresponding to the last digit and the remainder of `i` when split into digits, `sum_values` is a list of integers where each value at index `i` is the cumulative sum of the values in `values` up to index `i`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `total` remains unchanged at 45.
- The value of `i` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The `values` list has been updated such that for each index `i` from 10 to `n`, the value at `values[i]` is the sum of the values at the indices corresponding to the last digit and the remainder of `i` when split into digits.
- The `sum_values` list has been updated to contain the cumulative sum of the `values` list up to each index `i` from 10 to `n`.
