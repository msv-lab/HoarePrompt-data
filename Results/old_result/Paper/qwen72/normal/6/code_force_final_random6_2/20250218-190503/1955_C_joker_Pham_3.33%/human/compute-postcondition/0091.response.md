Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n` - 1 or `n` - 2, and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. If `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k` and `k` > 0 and `l` != `r`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `sunks` remains unchanged. If `l` == `r`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
