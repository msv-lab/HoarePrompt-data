Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object representing a tree with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer indicating the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` < `n`, `beg` is the largest integer such that `func_3(tree, n, k, beg)` returns `True`, and `end` is equal to `beg`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `beg` and `end` will both be equal to the largest integer for which the function `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns `True`. This means that the loop has effectively found the maximum value of `mid` for which `func_3` returns `True`. The other variables, `tree`, `n`, and `k`, remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
