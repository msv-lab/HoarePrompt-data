Output State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0] = 1`, `row[-1] = 0`, and for each index `i` in the range `1` to `d-1`, `row[i]` is `row[i] + 2 * (d-1)`, `d` is a positive integer such that `1 <= d < len(row)`, `i` is `d + 3`, `min_heap` is a heapified list of tuples containing the elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`.**

The `pass` statement does not change any of the variables or the state of the program. Therefore, all the initial conditions and variable values remain the same.
