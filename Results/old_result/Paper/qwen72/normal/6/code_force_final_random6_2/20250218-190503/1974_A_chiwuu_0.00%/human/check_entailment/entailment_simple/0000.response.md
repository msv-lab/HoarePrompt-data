### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, where `a` is the number of 1x1 icons and `b` is the number of 2x2 icons.

2. **Calculating the Number of Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The variable `t` is calculated as `b * 2` (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the grid is 5x3, each screen can hold 2 such icons).
   - If `t` is divisible by 5, it is divided by 5 to get the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons. Otherwise, it is divided by 5 and incremented by 1 to account for the remaining icons.

3. **Calculating the Remaining Space**:
   - The variable `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which represents the total number of cells available on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, it means there is enough space on the screens to place all the 1x1 icons, and the number of screens remains `t`.

4. **Handling Insufficient Space**:
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, it means there is not enough space to place all the 1x1 icons on the current screens.
   - The variable `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`, which represents the number of additional 1x1 icons that need to be placed.
   - The number of additional screens needed is calculated by dividing `t2` by 15 (since each screen has 15 cells) and adding 1 if there is a remainder.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified.
- The logic for calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is correct.
- The logic for calculating the remaining space and handling insufficient space is also correct.
- The program correctly accounts for the total number of screens needed to place all icons.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
