Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly solves the problem based on the provided constraints and examples. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `x`.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function finds all divisors of a given number `x`. It does this by iterating from 1 to the square root of `x` and checking if `x` is divisible by the current number. If it is, both the divisor and the corresponding quotient are added to the list of divisors. The function then reverses the list of smaller divisors and concatenates it with the list of larger divisors to ensure all divisors are included.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program checks if `(n + x - 2)` is even. If it is, it finds all divisors of `(n + x - 2)` using `func_1` and processes them to find valid `k` values.
   - Similarly, it checks if `(n - x)` is even. If it is, it finds all divisors of `(n - x)` using `func_1` and processes them to find valid `k` values.
   - For each divisor `s`, it checks if `(s + 2) / 2` is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to `x`. If both conditions are met, it adds `(s + 2) / 2` to the list of valid `k` values.
   - Finally, it removes duplicates from the list of valid `k` values and prints the length of the list, which is the number of different `k` values that fit the given constraints.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the test case `10 2`, the valid `k` values are 2, 3, 5, and 6, which matches the expected output of 4.
   - For the test case `3 1`, the valid `k` value is 2, which matches the expected output of 1.
   - For the test case `76 4`, the valid `k` values are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, which matches the expected output of 9.
   - For the test case `100 99`, there are no valid `k` values, which matches the expected output of 0.
   - For the test case `1000000000 500000000`, the valid `k` value is 500000000, which matches the expected output of 1.

The program is logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
