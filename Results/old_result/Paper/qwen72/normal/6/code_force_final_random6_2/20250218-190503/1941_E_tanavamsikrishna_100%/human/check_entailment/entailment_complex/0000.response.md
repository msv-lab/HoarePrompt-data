Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row of the river grid.
   - It starts by setting the first element of the row to 1 and incrementing each element in the range from 1 to `d-1` by 2. This ensures that the cost of the first support is 1 and the cost of the next `d-1` supports is increased by 2.
   - It then uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports within the last `d+1` cells. This is necessary to ensure that the distance between any two adjacent supports does not exceed `d`.
   - For each cell from index `d` to the end of the row, it updates the cost of the support by adding the minimum cost from the heap and 1 (the cost of installing a support).
   - Finally, it returns the last element of the modified row, which represents the total cost of installing supports for that row.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and the grid of river depths.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row in the grid to calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for that row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of every contiguous subsequence of length `k` in the `costs` list.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost from these sums.

3. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports does not exceed `d` by using a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost within the last `d+1` cells.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly calculates the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of every contiguous subsequence of length `k` and selecting the minimum.
   - The input and output handling in `func_2` is consistent with the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
