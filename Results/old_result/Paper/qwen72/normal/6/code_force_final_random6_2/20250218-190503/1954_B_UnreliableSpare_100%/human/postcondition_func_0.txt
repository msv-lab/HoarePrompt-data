The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the input. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of `arr` before encountering a different element and prints this minimum count. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
