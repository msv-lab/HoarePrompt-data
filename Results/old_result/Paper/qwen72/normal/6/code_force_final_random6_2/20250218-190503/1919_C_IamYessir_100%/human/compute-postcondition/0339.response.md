Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 3, `a` and `b` are lists where each element in `a` is greater than or equal to the element before it, and each element in `b` is greater than or equal to the element before it. `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity. `a` must have at least 4 elements. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 3. Otherwise, `s` is 1.** 

Explanation: The value of `s` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` (which is `a[3]`) is greater than `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[2]`), then `s` was initially 2 and is now 3. Otherwise, `s` was initially 0 and is now 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
