It seems there is a misunderstanding in the provided function definition. The function described in the problem statement is `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)`, but the function definition provided is `def func():`. To correctly address the problem, I will assume the function definition should be `def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end):`.

Given this, the precondition for the function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` is:

Precondition: **start and end are integers, where start <= end, and the current directory contains subfolders that can be represented as integers within the range [start, end].**
