Output State: **`lst` remains a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `n + 1`, `sm` is the sum of the first `n - 2` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from the second-to-last element to the end of `lst` plus `(n + 1 - (n - 2) + 1)`, `r` is `n - 2`, `l` is `n + 1`, `over_sum` is `sm`.**

Explanation:
- `over_sum` is assigned the value of `sm`.
- The values of `lst`, `i`, `j`, `sm`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- `over_sum` now holds the same value as `sm`, which is the sum of the first `n - 2` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from the second-to-last element to the end of `lst` plus `(n + 1 - (n - 2) + 1)`.
