Postcondition: ***`res` is a non-empty list, `ul` and `ur` are not equal, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is `n + 2`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken, and the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, and the element at index `a[i] - 1` in `r` was 2, then this element is now 0, and `ur` is `ur + 2`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
