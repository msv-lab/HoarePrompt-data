### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.

2. **Operation Simulation:**
   - The program iterates through the array to check if any element is out of order (i.e., `list1[p - 1] > list1[p]`).
   - If an out-of-order element is found and it is greater than 10, the program splits it into its digits and inserts them back into the array at the appropriate position.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - After potentially performing the operations, the program checks if the array is sorted using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function correctly checks if the list `lst` is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the array is already sorted.
   - The program handles the case where the array contains elements less than 10, which cannot be split.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program only performs the operation once for each out-of-order element. This means it may not correctly handle cases where multiple operations are needed to sort the array.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. The program will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and insert them, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`. However, it does not check if further operations are needed to sort the array completely.

### Conclusion:
The program is **incorrect** because it does not ensure that the array is fully sorted after performing the operations. It only performs a single operation for each out-of-order element, which is insufficient for some test cases.

### Correctness:
**False**
