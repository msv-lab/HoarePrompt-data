Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, the current directory contains subfolders that can be represented as integers within the range [start, end], `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n == 2:
        if s == '00':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        count_1 = s.count('1')
        if count_1 % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif s.count('11') == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, the current directory contains subfolders that can be represented as integers within the range [start, end], `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string. If `n` is 2, the program executes the if part, and if `s` is '00', the program executes the if part. If `n` is not 2, `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in the string `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the condition `count_1 % 2 != 0` is retained. If `count_1` is even, the condition `count_1 % 2 == 0` is retained, and if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', this condition is also retained. Otherwise, the number of occurrences of the substring '11' in `s` is not equal to 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, the current directory contains subfolders that can be represented as integers within the range [start, end], `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 2, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is a new input string. If `n` == 2, the program behaves as described in the if part. If `n` is not 2, `count_1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`. If `count_1` is odd or if `count_1` is even and `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11', the program behaves as described in the if part. If `count_1` is even and `s` does not contain exactly one occurrence of '11', the program behaves as described in the else part.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, the current directory contains subfolders that can be represented as integers within the range [start, end], `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 3, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the new input string. If `n` == 2, the postcondition remains as described. If `n` != 2, `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. If `count_1 % 2 != 0`, no changes are made to the variables. If `s.count('11') == 1`, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
