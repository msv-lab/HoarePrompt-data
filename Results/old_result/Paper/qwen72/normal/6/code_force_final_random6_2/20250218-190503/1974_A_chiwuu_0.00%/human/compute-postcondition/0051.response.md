Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; `a` is the integer value of the first part of the input string; `b` is the integer value of the second part of the input string; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `t2` is `a - t1`; `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.
- `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
- The other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
