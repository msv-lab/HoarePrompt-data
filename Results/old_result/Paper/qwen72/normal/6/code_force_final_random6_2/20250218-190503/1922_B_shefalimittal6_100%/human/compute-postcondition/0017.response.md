Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `v[x]` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `n` is now `n - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `v[x]` is incremented by 1, so it changes from 1 to 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
