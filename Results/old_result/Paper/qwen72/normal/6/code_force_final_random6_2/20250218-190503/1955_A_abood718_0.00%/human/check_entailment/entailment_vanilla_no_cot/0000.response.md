Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Output for Odd `n`**: When `n` is odd, the program calculates the cost for `n // 2` pairs of yogurts and then adds the cost of one additional yogurt. However, it prints the value of `X` (which is `n // 2`) before the final result, which is not required and incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Promotional Price**: The condition `if B * 2 < C` is correct for determining whether to use the promotional price or not. However, the program should always consider the promotional price if it is cheaper, even if `n` is odd.

3. **Final Calculation for Odd `n`**: The final calculation for odd `n` should be `X * C + B` where `X` is `n // 2`, but the program should not print `X` separately.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            X = A // 2
            if A % 2 == 0:
                print(X * C)
            else:
                print(X * C + B)
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- If the promotional price for two yogurts is cheaper than buying them individually, it uses the promotional price.
- If `n` is even, it calculates the total cost using the promotional price.
- If `n` is odd, it calculates the cost for `n // 2` pairs of yogurts using the promotional price and adds the cost of one additional yogurt.
