Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 4, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (g / count + 1) + (g / count + 1)`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is equal to `n / 4 - 3`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1` to its current value.
- The current value of `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (g / count + 1)`.
- After the addition, the new value of `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (g / count + 1) + (g / count + 1)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `countmins`, and `g`) remain unchanged.
