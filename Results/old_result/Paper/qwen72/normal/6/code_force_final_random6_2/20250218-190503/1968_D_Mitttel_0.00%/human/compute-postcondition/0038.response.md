Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `index` is now `3 * n + 8 + n + 4 + n`, `p` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`, `a` is now a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `results` now includes the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**

Explanation:
- The code updates the list `a` to contain `n` integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `index`, `p`, `results`, `result`) retain their previous values or conditions.
