Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 3, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`, `countmins` is 2, and `g` is equal to `n / 3`. `m` must be greater than or equal to 3. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
