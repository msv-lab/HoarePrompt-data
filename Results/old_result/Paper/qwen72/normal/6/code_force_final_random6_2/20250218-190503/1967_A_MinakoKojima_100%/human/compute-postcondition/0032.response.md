Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `dif` is the difference between the third and the second element of the list `a`. If `dif` is 0, `ans` remains equal to the first element of the list `a` and `res` remains equal to `n - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to the first element of the list `a` plus `dif` if `k >= dif * (i + 1)` or remains equal to the first element of the list `a` otherwise, and `res` is equal to `n - 3` if `k >= dif * 2` or `n - 2` otherwise.***
