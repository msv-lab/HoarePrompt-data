The code snippet `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and the last element of `a` is removed, but `a` must still contain at least one element that is 0, the last element of `a` is removed, and `a` still contains at least one 0.

The other variables (`i`, `res`, `_`, `n`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed, the last element of `a` is removed, but `a` still contains at least one element that is 0; `i` is `i - 1`; `res` is 0; `_` is less than `t`; `n` is an input integer.**
