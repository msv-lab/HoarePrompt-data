### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to pick elements from an array `a` and append them to a new array `c` (only Alice appends to `c`).
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` after all elements from `a` have been picked.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many small integers as possible in `c`.
   - To minimize the MEX, Bob should try to exclude the smallest integers from `c` by picking them when it's his turn.
   - The key is to determine which integers are picked by Alice and which are picked by Bob.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the range `[0, n-1]` to find the first integer `i` that is either not present in `arr` or appears exactly once and is the first such integer encountered.
   - If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it means `i` is not present in `arr`, and the MEX is `i`.
   - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i] == 1`, and `first` is `True`, it means `i` is the first integer that appears exactly once, and the MEX is `i`.
   - The variable `first` is used to track whether an integer that appears exactly once has been encountered.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the first integer `i` that is either not present in `arr` or appears exactly once.
   - The use of `first` ensures that if there are multiple integers that appear exactly once, the program will print the smallest one.
   - The logic aligns with the optimal strategy for both players:
     - Alice will try to include the smallest integers that appear exactly once.
     - Bob will try to exclude the smallest integers that appear exactly once.
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases and the constraints provided in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
