### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` where `A` is the number of yogurts, `B` is the price of one yogurt, and `C` is the price of two yogurts on promotion.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation:**
   - **Case 1: `B * 2 < C`**
     - If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is less than the promotion price (`C`), then it is cheaper to buy each yogurt individually.
     - The function prints `A * B`, which is the total cost of buying `A` yogurts at the regular price.
   - **Case 2: `A % 2 == 0`**
     - If the number of yogurts `A` is even, then Maxim can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.
     - The function prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the total cost of buying `A` yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.
   - **Case 3: `A % 2 != 0`**
     - If the number of yogurts `A` is odd, then Maxim can buy `A // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price.
     - The function prints `X` (which is `A // 2`) and then `X * C + B`, which is the total cost of buying `A // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the minimum cost for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Output for Odd `A`:**
  - The function prints two values when `A` is odd: `X` and `X * C + B`.
  - However, the problem statement requires only one value to be printed for each test case, which is the minimum cost.
  - The line `print(X)` should be removed to ensure only one value is printed.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected by removing the extra `print(X)` line.
- **False** if the program is not corrected, as it prints an extra value which is not required by the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it prints an extra value when `A` is odd, which is not part of the required output.
