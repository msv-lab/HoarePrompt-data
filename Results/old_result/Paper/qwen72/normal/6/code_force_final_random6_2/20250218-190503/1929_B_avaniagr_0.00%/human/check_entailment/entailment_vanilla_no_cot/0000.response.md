Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads from standard input, where the first line is the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains the values `n` and `k` for each test case. This is consistent with the problem's input format.

2. **Logic**:
   - The program calculates the minimum number of cells to color using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \left(\frac{k}{2} + k \% 2\right) \times (k < 4n - 3) + 2n \times (k \geq 4n - 3) + (k == 4n - 2)
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the following observations:
     - For \( k < 4n - 3 \), the minimum number of cells to color is \( \left\lceil \frac{k}{2} \right\rceil \). This is because each colored cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal).
     - For \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), you need to color at least \( 2n \) cells to cover all but one diagonal.
     - If \( k == 4n - 2 \), you need to color all \( 2n \) cells to cover all diagonals.

3. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which matches the problem's output format.

Given these points, the program correctly handles the input, applies the correct logic, and produces the expected output for the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
