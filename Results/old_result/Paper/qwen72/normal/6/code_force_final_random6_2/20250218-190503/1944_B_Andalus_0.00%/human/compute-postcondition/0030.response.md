To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the given state:

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
```
- The loop variable `i` will start from 1 and go up to `n-1` (inclusive).
- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1.

### Given State
- `T` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` and `k` are input integers.
- `lst` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
- `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element.
- `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`.
- `rdb` remains an empty list.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Loop Variable `i`**:
   - The loop variable `i` should start from 1 and go up to `n-1`.
   - The given state says `i` is `n-1`. This is incorrect because the loop variable `i` should start from 1.

2. **Input Integer `n`**:
   - The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1.
   - The given state says `n` is greater than or equal to 1. This needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.

### Adjusted State
- `i` should be 1.
- `n` should be greater than 1.

### Final State
State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ldb` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`, `rdb` remains an empty list.**
