Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `c` and `d` are integers provided by the user input, `e` and `f` are integers provided by the user input, `g` and `h` are integers provided by the user input, `n` is equal to (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f).**

The value of `n` is calculated as the sum of the squares of the differences between `a` and `e`, and `b` and `f`. The other variables remain unchanged.
