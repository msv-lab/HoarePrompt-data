Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not always generate a sequence that maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is intended to find the highest bit position that is set in the binary representation of `k`. However, it returns the position of the highest bit set minus one. For example, if `k = 5` (binary `101`), `func_1(5)` returns `2` (since the highest bit is at position 3, but the function returns 2).

2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The program constructs the sequence by adding `2 ** counter - 1` to the array, where `counter` is the highest bit position set in `k`. This value is the largest number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position.
   - It then adds `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` to the array, and appends `0` for the remaining elements.
   - This approach does not always maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the test case `n = 2, k = 5`, the program outputs `3 2`. The bitwise OR of `3` and `2` is `3` (binary `11`), which has 2 ones. However, a better solution would be `5 0`, where the bitwise OR is `5` (binary `101`), which has 3 ones.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR, you should try to distribute the bits of `k` across the `n` numbers in such a way that as many bits as possible are set to 1 in the final OR result.
   - One effective way is to set the highest bit of `k` in one number and distribute the remaining bits across the other numbers.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        # Find the highest bit position set in k
        highest_bit = 1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)
        arr.append(highest_bit)
        remaining = k - highest_bit
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if remaining > 0:
                arr.append(remaining & -remaining)  # Add the lowest set bit of remaining
                remaining -= arr[-1]
            else:
                arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)
```

Explanation:
- `highest_bit` is the highest bit set in `k`.
- The first element of the array is set to `highest_bit`.
- The remaining sum is distributed by adding the lowest set bit of the remaining sum to the array until the remaining sum is zero.
- This ensures that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR is maximized.
