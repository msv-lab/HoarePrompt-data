### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and processes them to determine the number of available positions for further moves.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - For each move `(a, b)`, the program checks if `a != b`:
     - If `a != b`, it means the computer will place a rook at `(b, a)`, which is a different position. Therefore, both positions `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are occupied, reducing the number of available positions by 2.
     - If `a == b`, it means the computer skips its turn, and only one position `(a, a)` is occupied, reducing the number of available positions by 1.
   - This logic is correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Dynamic Programming for Counting Configurations:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` is used to compute the number of different final configurations.
   - The dynamic programming (DP) approach is used to count the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining positions.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`, which are the base cases for 0 and 1 available positions.
   - For each `i` from 2 to `n`, the program updates the DP array using the formula:
     - `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]`
     - This formula accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the current configuration, considering the previous configurations.
   - The result is taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers.
   - The DP formula is correct for counting the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on a chessboard, as it considers both placing a rook in a new row and column, and placing rooks in the remaining positions.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of different final configurations modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - This output is correctly formatted and matches the problem requirements.

### Challenging the Original Assessment:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 or 2 correctly.
  - For `n = 1`, the only configuration is placing a single rook, which is correctly counted.
  - For `n = 2`, the configurations are correctly counted based on the moves made.

- **Complexity:**
  - The time complexity of the program is \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.
  - The space complexity is \(O(1)\) due to the use of a fixed-size DP array, which is also efficient.

- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The modulo operation is correctly applied to ensure the result is within the required range.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly processes the input, updates the number of available positions, and uses a dynamic programming approach to count the number of different final configurations. The modulo operation ensures that the result is within the required range.

Final: **True**
