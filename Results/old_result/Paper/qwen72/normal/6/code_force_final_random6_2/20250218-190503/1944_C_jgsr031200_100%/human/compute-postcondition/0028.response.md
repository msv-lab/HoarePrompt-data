The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The condition for `n` remains the same, as it is the length of the list `arr` and does not change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, `n` is the length of `arr` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the frequency of the integer `i` in `arr`, `i` is 2.**
