Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `int(input())` is greater than 0. This means the first input is a positive integer.
   - `i` is 0. This is the initial value of the index variable.
   - `n` and `k` are integers from the input split by a space. This means the second input line contains two integers separated by a space, which are assigned to `n` and `k` respectively.
   - `l` is a list of integers from the input split by a space. This means the third input line contains a list of integers separated by spaces, which are assigned to `l`.
   - `c` is the cumulative sum of the positive elements in `l` up to the last element processed. This means `c` is the sum of all positive elements in `l` that have been processed so far.
   - `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`. This means `maxi` is the highest cumulative sum of positive elements encountered during the processing of `l`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is: `print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)`

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - **`2 ** k`**: This is 2 raised to the power of `k`.
   - **`2 ** k * maxi`**: This is the result of multiplying `2 ** k` by `maxi`.
   - **`2 ** k * maxi - maxi`**: This is the result of subtracting `maxi` from `2 ** k * maxi`.
   - **`sum(l)`**: This is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.
   - **`2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)`**: This is the result of adding `sum(l)` to `2 ** k * maxi - maxi`.
   - **`result % 1000000007`**: This is the result of the above expression modulo 1000000007.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The final output is the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

Given the initial state, we can describe the output as follows:

- `k` is an integer from the input.
- `maxi` is the maximum cumulative sum of the positive elements in `l`.
- `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

Output: **(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 (where k is the second integer from the input, maxi is the maximum cumulative sum of the positive elements in the list l, and sum(l) is the sum of all elements in the list l)**
