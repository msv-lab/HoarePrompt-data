Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is `t`, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the new input `a` and converting each element to an integer, `o` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input, `n` is equal to the first integer in the list `b`, `f` is equal to the second integer in the list `b`, `k` is equal to the third integer in the list `b`, `fav` is the string at index `f - 1` in the list `o` (which is now sorted in descending order), `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a string from `o` and each value is the count of that string in `o`, `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order, `a` is the new input string. If the index of `fav` in `o` is greater than `k - 1`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statements in the current iteration.***
