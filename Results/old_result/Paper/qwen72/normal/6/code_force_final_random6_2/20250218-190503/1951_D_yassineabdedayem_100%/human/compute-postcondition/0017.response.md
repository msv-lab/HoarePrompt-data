The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is the first integer read from the input line, and `k` is the second integer read from the input line. The relationship between `n` and `k` remains unchanged by the loop head, and the placeholder variable `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration.

Since `_` is a placeholder variable, it is not relevant to the loop's continuation condition. The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0. After one iteration, `t` is decremented by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t < 1000, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is the first integer read from the input line, and `k` is the second integer read from the input line. If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`, and the relationship between `n + 2` and `k * 2` is such that either `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2` or `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.**
