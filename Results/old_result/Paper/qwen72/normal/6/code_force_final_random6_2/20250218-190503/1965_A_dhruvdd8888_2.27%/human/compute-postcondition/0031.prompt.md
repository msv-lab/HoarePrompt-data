You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The length of test_cases is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    nums = set(input().split())
    nums = sorted(map(int, nums))
    if (len(nums) == 1) :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program prints 'Alice' and returns None.
    #State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The length of `test_cases` is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `N` is an input integer. `nums` is now a sorted list of integers, and the length of `nums` is greater than 1.
    if (len(nums) == 2) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program prints 'Bob' and returns None.
    #State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The length of `test_cases` is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `N` is an input integer. `nums` is now a sorted list of integers, and the length of `nums` is greater than 2.
    nums.insert(0, 0)
    cd = 0
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        if nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1:
            cd += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `i` is the index of the last element in `nums` that was checked before the loop terminated. If all consecutive elements from `nums[1]` to `nums[len(nums) - 2]` have a difference of 1, then `cd` is `len(nums) - 3`. Otherwise, `cd` is the number of consecutive elements starting from `nums[1]` that have a difference of 1 before the first non-consecutive pair is found.
    if (cd & 1) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program prints 'Bob' and returns None.
    else :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program prints 'Alice' and returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. It evaluates each test case and prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the conditions of the game, and returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program prints 'Alice' and returns None.

Case_2: The program prints 'Bob' and returns None.

Case_3: The program prints 'Bob' and returns None.

Case_4: The program prints 'Alice' and returns None.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
