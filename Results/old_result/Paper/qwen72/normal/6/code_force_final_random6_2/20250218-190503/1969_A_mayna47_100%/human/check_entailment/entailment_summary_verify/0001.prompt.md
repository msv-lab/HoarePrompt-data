You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
    print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `n` from the user, representing the number of friends, and a list `p` of length `n` from the user, where each element `p_i` indicates the best friend of the i-th friend. The function then checks if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns. If no such pair is found, it prints `3` and returns. The final state of the program is that it has printed either `2` or `3` to the console, depending on whether a mutual best friend pair was found.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `v`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` with zeros.
   - It then updates `v` to include the input values, starting from index 1. This is necessary because the friends are indexed from 1 to `n`.

3. **Checking for Pairs**:
   - The program iterates over each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - It checks if `v[v[i]] == i`, which means that the best friend of `i`'s best friend is `i` itself. This indicates that `i` and `v[i]` form a pair of mutual best friends.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns immediately, as sending invitations to both friends in the pair will ensure that both come to the party.

4. **Default Case**:
   - If no such pair is found, the program prints `3`.
   - The reasoning here is that if there are no mutual best friend pairs, the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3. This is because inviting 3 friends will always ensure that at least 2 of them have their best friends also invited.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 2` correctly. In this case, the only possible input is `[2, 1]`, and the program will print `2` because the two friends are mutual best friends.
   - For larger `n`, the program correctly identifies mutual best friend pairs and prints `2` if such a pair exists. If no such pair exists, it prints `3`.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - It handles all given constraints and edge cases correctly.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
