Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. This is done using `t = int(input())` and a loop `for _ in range(t)`.

2. **Case Handling**:
   - **Case 1: `k == n`**:
     - If `k` is equal to `n`, it means all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. The only way this can happen is if all elements in the array are the same. The program correctly handles this by creating an array of `n` elements, all set to `1` using `res = [1] * n`.
   - **Case 2: `k == 1`**:
     - If `k` is equal to `1`, it means exactly one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. One way to achieve this is to have an array where the elements are in strictly increasing order, and the first element is the smallest. The program correctly handles this by creating an array of `n` elements using `res = range(n)`, which generates a sequence from `0` to `n-1`.
   - **Case 3: `k != 1` and `k != n`**:
     - If `k` is neither `1` nor `n`, the program outputs `-1` using `res = [-1]`. This is because for `k` to be valid, the array must either have all elements the same (for `k == n`) or exactly one sorted cyclic shift (for `k == 1`). Any other value of `k` would not satisfy the conditions of the problem.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of each test case using `print(*res)`. This correctly unpacks the list `res` and prints its elements separated by spaces, which is the required format for the output.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `k` is `1` or `n` correctly.
   - For any other value of `k`, the program correctly outputs `-1`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle all the specified cases and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
