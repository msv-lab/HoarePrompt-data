Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `t` is the length of `test_cases` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ls` is now equal to `nums[1] - nums[0] + nums[2] - (nums[1] - nums[0])`, `i` is 2, `nums[0]` is unchanged, `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - nums[0]`, `nums[2]` is now `nums[2] - (nums[1] - nums[0])`.**
