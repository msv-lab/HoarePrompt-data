The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if the result of `int(input())` is greater than 0, and `_` is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs.

At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `_` is a placeholder that is incremented by 1 for each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, the user must provide a new input integer greater than 0, and `_` will be reset to 0 for the new loop.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `a` is the new input string, `ans` is the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, and `i` is the length of `a` minus 2.**

However, to be precise, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect the state of the loop head variables only. Since `_` is a placeholder and does not retain its value between iterations, and `int(input())` is evaluated at the start of each iteration, the state should be:

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
