### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given `n` types of cards, each type `i` having `a_i` cards.
   - We can buy up to `k` additional cards of any type.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - To form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`, each number from 1 to `n` must appear exactly once in the subarray.
   - The score is the number of such subarrays we can form.
   - The minimum number of cards of any type `i` is the limiting factor for forming permutations.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list `a` of card counts.
   - It sorts the list `a` to handle the smallest counts first.
   - It initializes `ans` to the smallest count in `a` (i.e., `a[0]`), which is the initial limiting factor.
   - It iterates through the sorted list to try to equalize the counts of the cards by using the available coins `k`.
   - If the difference `dif` between the current count and the next count can be covered by the remaining coins, it updates `ans` and reduces `k` accordingly.
   - If the difference cannot be fully covered, it updates `ans` by the maximum possible amount and breaks the loop.
   - After the loop, if there are still coins left, it uses them to further increase the count of cards.
   - Finally, it calculates the score by adding the number of permutations that can be formed and appends the result to `ans_list`.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `ans` is set to the smallest count in `a` because this is the initial limiting factor.
     - `res` is set to `n - 1` to keep track of the number of cards that need to be equalized.
   - **Equalizing Counts:**
     - The program iterates through the sorted list `a` and tries to equalize the counts.
     - For each pair of consecutive counts, it calculates the difference `dif`.
     - If `dif` can be covered by the remaining coins, it updates `ans` and reduces `k`.
     - If `dif` cannot be covered, it updates `ans` by the maximum possible amount and breaks the loop.
   - **Using Remaining Coins:**
     - If there are still coins left after the loop, it uses them to further increase the count of cards.
   - **Calculating the Score:**
     - The score is calculated by adding the number of permutations that can be formed and any remaining cards that can be used to form additional permutations.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is zero or less than the difference between the smallest and next smallest counts.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is large enough to equalize all counts and still have some coins left.

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly identifies the limiting factor and tries to equalize the counts using the available coins.
   - It correctly calculates the score by considering the number of permutations that can be formed and any remaining cards.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program follows the correct logic to maximize the score by equalizing the counts of cards and using the remaining coins effectively. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the given problem description.
