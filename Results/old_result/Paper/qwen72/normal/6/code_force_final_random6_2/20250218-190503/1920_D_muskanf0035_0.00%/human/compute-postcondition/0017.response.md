Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers provided by the user input, `t` must be greater than 2, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains two integers `b` and `x` as provided by the user input, `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers, `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is 2.**

The function `func_1(n, operations, queries)` has been called with the provided inputs, and the result of this function call is stored in the variable `result`. The other variables (`n`, `q`, `t`, `operations`, `queries`, and `_`) remain unchanged. The specific value of `result` depends on the implementation of `func_1` and the inputs provided.
