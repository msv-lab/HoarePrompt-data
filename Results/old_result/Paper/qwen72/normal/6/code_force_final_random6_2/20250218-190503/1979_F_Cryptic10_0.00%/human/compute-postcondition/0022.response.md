Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 3`, `path` is a list that may contain the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `v` and `u` are the new values returned by `func_1(d)`, and `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.**
