To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 50\).
   - `vals` is a list of `N` integers where each integer \(2 \leq \text{vals}[i] \leq 20\) for all \(0 \leq i < N\).
   - `den` is the result of applying `func_1` to all elements of `vals` sequentially, starting with `vals[0]` as the initial value.
   - `vprod` is a list of `N` integers where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals` (using integer division).
   - `den` is now `den` minus the sum of `vprod`.
   - `den` is greater than 0.

2. **Understanding `func_1`:**
   - Since the exact definition of `func_1` is not provided, we can assume it is a function that combines the elements of `vals` in some way. For the sake of this task, let's assume `func_1` is a function that calculates the product of all elements in `vals`.

3. **Calculating `den`:**
   - `den` is the product of all elements in `vals`.
   - For example, if `vals = [2, 3, 4]`, then `den = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24`.

4. **Calculating `vprod`:**
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals` (using integer division).
   - Continuing the example:
     - `vprod[0] = den // vals[0] = 24 // 2 = 12`
     - `vprod[1] = den // vals[1] = 24 // 3 = 8`
     - `vprod[2] = den // vals[2] = 24 // 4 = 6`
   - So, `vprod = [12, 8, 6]`.

5. **Updating `den`:**
   - `den` is now `den` minus the sum of `vprod`.
   - Continuing the example:
     - `sum(vprod) = 12 + 8 + 6 = 26`
     - `den = 24 - 26 = -2`
   - However, the precondition states that `den` is greater than 0, so this example is not valid. We need to ensure that `den` remains positive after the subtraction.

6. **Ensuring `den` is positive:**
   - For `den` to remain positive, the sum of `vprod` must be less than `den`.
   - This implies that the elements of `vals` must be chosen such that the sum of `vprod` is less than `den`.

7. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces.
   - The elements of `vprod` are the integer divisions of `den` by each element in `vals`.

Given the precondition and the steps above, the output will be the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces. Since the exact values of `vals` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of the elements of `vprod`.

Output: **[vprod[0]] [vprod[1]] ... [vprod[N-1]] (where each vprod[i] is den // vals[i] and den is the product of all elements in vals minus the sum of vprod)**

This description ensures that the output is precise and understandable based on the given initial state.
