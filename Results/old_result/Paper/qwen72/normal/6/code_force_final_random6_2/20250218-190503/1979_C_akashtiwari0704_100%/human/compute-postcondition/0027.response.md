Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `bets` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to the length of `a`, `g` is the product of all elements in `l` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD) with the current value of `g` at each step, `l` must have at least `len(l)` elements, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`) is `prod // a[j]`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a`, `sumo` is the integer value of the sum of all elements in `a` after the transformation, and the current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.**
