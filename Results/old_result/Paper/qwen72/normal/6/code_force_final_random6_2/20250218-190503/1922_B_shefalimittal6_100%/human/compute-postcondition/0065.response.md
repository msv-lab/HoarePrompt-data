Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by `n`, `v[x]` is incremented by `n`, `cnt` is 0, `i` remains `n`, `ans` is 0.**

The code snippet initializes the variable `ans` to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
