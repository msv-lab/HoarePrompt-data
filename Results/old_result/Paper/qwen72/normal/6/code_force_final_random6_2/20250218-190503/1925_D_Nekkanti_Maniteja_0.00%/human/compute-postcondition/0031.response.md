The code snippet `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into three parts, and converts each part into an integer, assigning these values to `u`, `v`, and `f` respectively. 

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `i` is 0
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user
- `M` is 1000000007
- `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`
- `s` is 0
- `a` is 0
- `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated with the final values provided by the user in the last iteration
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 3
- `k` must be greater than or equal to 3
- The input value must be greater than `k - 1`

After executing the code snippet:
- `u`, `v`, and `f` are now assigned the values from the user input, which are integers.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is 0, `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated with the final values provided by the user in the last iteration, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, and the input value must be greater than `k - 1`.**
