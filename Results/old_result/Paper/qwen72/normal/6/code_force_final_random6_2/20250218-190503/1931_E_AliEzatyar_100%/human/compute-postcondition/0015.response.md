Output State: **The loop iterates from the last element to the first element of `num` in reverse order. The `counter` increments by 1 for each '0' encountered until a non-zero element is found or the loop reaches the beginning of the list. After all iterations, `counter` will be the number of trailing zeros in the list `num`, and `i` will be the index of the first non-zero element encountered from the end, or -1 if all elements are zero. The length of `num` remains unchanged, and each integer in `num` still satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `counter` will contain the count of consecutive zeros at the end of the list `num`. The variable `i` will be the index of the first non-zero element from the end, or -1 if the entire list consists of zeros. The list `num` and its length remain the same as they were in the initial state.
