Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans_list` is a list that contains the value of `ans` as its last element, `i` is 2, `dif` is the difference between the third and second elements of the list `a`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is updated to the first element of `a` plus `k // (i + 1)` plus `dif`, `res` is set to `n - 3` if `dif` is not 0, otherwise `res` is set to `n - 5`, and `k` is updated to `k - dif * (i + 1)`. If `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` is set to 0, `res` is not modified, and `ans` is updated to `ans + k // 3`. In all cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
