Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) indicating the number of test cases, and then reads `t` distinct strings of length 5, each composed of the characters 'A' and 'B'. For the last test case, it counts the number of 'A' and 'B' characters in the string. If the number of 'A' characters is greater than the number of 'B' characters, it prints 'A'. Otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value. **
