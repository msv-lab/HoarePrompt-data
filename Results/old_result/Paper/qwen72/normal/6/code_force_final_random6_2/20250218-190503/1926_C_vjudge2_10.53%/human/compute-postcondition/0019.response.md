The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range value `10`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `10`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The range value `10` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `n` is the last input integer, `values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `values` is an empty list, `sum_values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `sum_values` is an empty list, `total` is 0, `i` is 1, `values[0]` is 0, `sum_values[0]` is 0.**
