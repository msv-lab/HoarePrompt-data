The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated based on user input, where each value is converted to an integer. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nabors` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `in_aa` is the last element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the last element of `aa[:n - m]`, `_` is a placeholder, `aa` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `bb` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the minimum frequency of common elements between the current window of `m` elements in `aa` and all elements in `bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in the current window of `m` elements in `aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in `bb` that are not in `D`, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is the total number of times `tot` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop iterations.**
