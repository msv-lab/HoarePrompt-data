Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if new_segment:
        if arr[i] < 0:
            if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
            else:
                segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                max_segment = new_segment
            new_segment = []
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            new_segment[0] += arr[i]
    else:
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            new_segment = [arr[i], i]
        max_segment[0] += arr[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and `arr` must have at least one element. `i` is 0. If `new_segment` is true, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[0]`. If `new_segment` is false and `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is a list containing the first element of `arr` and the integer 0, and `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[0]`. If `new_segment` is false and `arr[0]` is less than 0, `new_segment` remains false, and `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and `arr` must have at least two elements. `i` is 1. `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[1]`. If `new_segment` is True and `arr[1]` is zero or positive, `new_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[1]`. If `new_segment` is False and `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is a list containing the second element of `arr` and the integer 1. Otherwise, `new_segment` remains an empty list or is not modified. `segments_variants` is not affected by this code snippet.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and `arr` must have at least three elements. `i` is 2. `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[2]`. If `new_segment` is not empty, and `arr[2] < 0`, `max_segment[0]` is further updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[1]`. If `new_segment` is not empty and `arr[2] >= 0`, `new_segment[0]` is updated to `new_segment[0] + arr[2]`. If `new_segment` is empty and `arr[2] >= 0`, `new_segment` is set to a list containing `arr[2]` and 2. Otherwise, `new_segment` remains an empty list or is not modified. `segments_variants` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
