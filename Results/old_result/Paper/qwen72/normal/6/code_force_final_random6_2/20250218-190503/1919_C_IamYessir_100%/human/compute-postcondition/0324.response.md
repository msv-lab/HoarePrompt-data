Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a` before the execution. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` now contains the element `lit[i]` at the end of the list. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x`, `b` is no longer an empty list, and `y` is set to the last element of `b`, which is `lit[i]`.***
