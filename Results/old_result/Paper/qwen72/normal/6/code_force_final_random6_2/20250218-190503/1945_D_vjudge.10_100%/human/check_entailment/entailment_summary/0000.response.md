Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: Kirill starts at the end of the queue and wants to move to a position not exceeding `m`. He can bribe people to move forward, and the cost of moving to position `j` from position `i` (where `j < i`) is `a_j` plus the sum of `b_k` for all `k` such that `j < k < i`.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
   - It initializes `pergunta` to infinity, which will store the minimum cost.
   - It iterates from the end of the queue (position `n-1`) to the beginning (position `0`).
   - For each position `i`, it checks if `i` is less than `m`. If so, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`, where `x` is the cumulative cost of bribes from position `i+1` to `n-1`.
   - It then adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x` to account for the cost of moving to position `i`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The function correctly calculates the cumulative cost of bribes as Kirill moves forward.
   - The condition `if i < m` ensures that Kirill only considers positions up to `m` for the final answer.
   - The use of `min(a[i], b[i])` in the cumulative cost calculation ensures that Kirill pays the minimum possible cost to move to position `i`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `m` is equal to `n` (Kirill doesn't need to move).
   - The function also handles the case where `m` is 1 (Kirill needs to move to the front of the queue).

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is the correct behavior according to the problem description.

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with `pergunta` as an argument, but `pergunta` is not used within the function in a way that affects the result. This is unnecessary and can be removed.
   - The function should be called without passing `pergunta` as an argument, and `pergunta` should be initialized inside `func_1`.

7. **Corrected Code**:
   ```python
   numCasos = int(input())
   for i in range(numCasos):
       (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
       a = list(map(int, input().split()))
       b = list(map(int, input().split()))
       func_1(a, b, n, m)

   def func_1(a, b, n, m):
       pergunta = float('inf')
       x = 0
       for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
           if i < m:
               pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
           x += min(a[i], b[i])
       print(pergunta)
   ```

Given the reasoning and the corrected code, the original program is incorrect due to the unnecessary argument `pergunta` being passed to `func_1`.

Correctness: **False**
