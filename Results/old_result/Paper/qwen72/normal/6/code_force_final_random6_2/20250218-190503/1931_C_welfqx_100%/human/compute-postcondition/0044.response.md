Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is the index where `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]` if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index where `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]` and the loop breaks, `cn` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `num` that are equal.**

In natural language, this means:
- The initial input `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- The variable `r` remains 0.
- The variable `n` is the length of the list `num`.
- The variable `f` remains 1.
- The list `num` is unchanged.
- The variable `j` is the index where the loop breaks if `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`. If the loop completes without breaking, `j` is `n - 2`.
- The variable `onum` is still a reversed copy of `num`.
- The variables `symb1` and `symb2` remain the first and last elements of `num`, respectively.
- The variable `i` is the index at which the loop breaks or `n - 2` if the loop completes.
- The variable `cn` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of `num` that are equal. If all elements are equal, `cn` will be `n`. If the loop breaks, `cn` will be the number of elements that were equal before the break.
