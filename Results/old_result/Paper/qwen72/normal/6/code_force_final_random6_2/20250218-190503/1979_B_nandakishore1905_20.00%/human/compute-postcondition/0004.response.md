To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\) and \(x \neq y\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, i.e., \(k = |n - m|\).
   - `k` is a power of 2.

2. **Conditions:**
   - \(k = |n - m|\) and \(k\) is a power of 2.

Given these conditions, `k` must be one of the following values: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216, 33554432, 67108864, 134217728, 268435456, 536870912, 1073741824.

Since `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and is a power of 2, the value of `k` will be one of the powers of 2 listed above.

Therefore, the `print(k)` statement will output one of these values, but we cannot determine the exact value without knowing the specific values of `n` and `m`.

Output: **k (where k is a power of 2 and k = |n - m|, with n and m being input integers greater than 0)**
