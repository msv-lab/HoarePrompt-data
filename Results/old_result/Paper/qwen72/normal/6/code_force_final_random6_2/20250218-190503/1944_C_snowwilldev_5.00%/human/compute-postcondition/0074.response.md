The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `N` must be greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `N` must still be greater than `i`, which means `N` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cnt` is a defaultdict initialized with int, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[a[1]]` is incremented by 1, `tc` is incremented by 1, `tc` must be less than the value returned by `int(input())`, `a` is a list of integers.**
