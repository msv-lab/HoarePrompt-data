Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 1, and the current value of `l` is equal to the current value of `r`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is set to 1, otherwise `sunks` remains 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
