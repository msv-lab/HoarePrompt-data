Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0, 1, or 2, `r` is `n` - 2, `n` - 3, or `n` - 4, `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`, `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, `sunks` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is decremented by 1.
- The initial value of `r` was `n` - 1, `n` - 2, or `n` - 3.
- After the decrement, `r` is now `n` - 2, `n` - 3, or `n` - 4.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
