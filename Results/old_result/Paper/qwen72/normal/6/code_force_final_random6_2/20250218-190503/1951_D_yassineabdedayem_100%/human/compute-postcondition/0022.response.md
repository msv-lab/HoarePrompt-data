The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- **`t`**: An input integer where 1 â‰¤ t < 1000. This variable is not used in the code snippet.
- **`n`**: The first integer read from the input line.
- **`k`**: The second integer read from the input line.
- **Relationship between `n` and `k`**:
  - If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k`.
  - If `n` is not equal to `k`, then the relationship between `n + 2` and `k * 2` is such that either `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2` or `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

### Explanation:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'YES'`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables. The conditions provided in the initial state are not used in the code snippet and thus do not influence the output.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
