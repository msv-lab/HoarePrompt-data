The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, and it will be set to 0 at the start of the loop. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input is a positive integer, which will allow the loop to execute.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
