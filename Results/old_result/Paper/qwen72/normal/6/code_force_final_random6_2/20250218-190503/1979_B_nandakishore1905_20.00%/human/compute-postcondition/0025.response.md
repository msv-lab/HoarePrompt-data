The value of `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The variable `l` is assigned the binary representation of `k` with the '0b' prefix removed.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x â‰  y, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**
