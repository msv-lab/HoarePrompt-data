Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are lists, `s` is 0, and `x` is less than or equal to `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, `a` contains the first element of `lit`, `x` is set to the first element of `lit`, and `y` remains positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element, and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` now includes `lit[0]` as its last element, and `x` is updated to `lit[0]`. If `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element, and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If none of these conditions are met, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
