Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by splitting the input array `a` into two halves, `lft` and `rgt`, and then finding pairs of duplicate elements and single elements to form the arrays `l` and `r`. However, there are a few issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Handling Duplicates and Singles**: The program sorts both halves of the array and then tries to find pairs of duplicates and single elements. However, the logic for identifying duplicates and singles is flawed. Specifically:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n):` skips the first element of the sorted list, which might be a duplicate.
   - The condition `elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:` is not necessary and can be simplified. This condition is intended to add single elements to the `sng` list, but it's not correctly handling the last element of the list.
   - The program does not correctly ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` and `r` are equal. It simply prints the first `k` elements it finds, without verifying the XOR condition.

2. **Output Format**: The program prints the elements of `l` and `r` directly, but it does not ensure that the output format matches the problem requirements. Specifically, it should print exactly `2k` elements for both `l` and `r`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when `k` is exactly `n/2` or when the array has a specific structure that makes finding pairs more challenging.

Given these issues, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
