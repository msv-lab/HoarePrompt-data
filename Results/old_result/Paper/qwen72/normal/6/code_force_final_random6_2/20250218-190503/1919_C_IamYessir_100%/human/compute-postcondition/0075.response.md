Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is positive infinity if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code `y = b[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `b` to the variable `y`.
- If `b` is not an empty list, `y` is now the last element of `b`.
- If `b` is an empty list, the initial state of `y` being positive infinity remains unchanged.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, and `x` remain the same as in the initial state.
