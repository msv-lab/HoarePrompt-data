Output State: **`x` is an input integer minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 2^i - 1, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a single positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is a list, `mx` is the maximum of 0 and `i`, and `i` is 0. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is updated to `x` minus 2^i, and `subseq_lens` contains the integer `i`.**
