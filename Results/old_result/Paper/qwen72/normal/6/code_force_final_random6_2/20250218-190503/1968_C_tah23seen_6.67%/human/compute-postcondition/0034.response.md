Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that \(1 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 500\) for all \(1 \leq i < n\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\), `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each \(1 \leq i < n-1\), `ans[i]` is the smallest multiple of `ans[i-1]` that is greater than `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]` if `ans[i]` is less than `arr[i]`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` remains as `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`. The final element `ans[n-1]` is updated to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state defines the list `arr` and the integer `n`.
- The list `ans` is constructed based on specific rules for each element.
- The code snippet `ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]` updates the last element of `ans` to be the sum of the second-to-last element of `ans` and the last element of `arr`.
- All other elements of `ans` and the values of `arr` and `n` remain unchanged.
