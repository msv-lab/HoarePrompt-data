### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function correctly returns the modulo of a given number with \(10^9 + 7\). It is a basic and correct implementation.
     - **Summary**: `func_1(number)` returns `number % 1000000007`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function attempts to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
     - It initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` to keep track of the current segment and the maximum segment found so far.
     - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed:
       - The condition `if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` does not correctly handle the case where `new_segment` is empty or where the current element is negative.
       - The function appends `new_segment` and `max_segment` to `segments_variants` multiple times, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.
       - The function also does not handle the case where the entire array is negative correctly.
     - **Summary**: `func_2(arr)` is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray but contains logical errors and does not produce the correct result.

   - **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
     - This function is incomplete and does not perform any operations. It is supposed to compute the final answer based on the maximum segment sum found by `func_2` and the number of operations `k`, but it is currently just a placeholder.
     - **Summary**: `func_3(number, quantity)` is intended to return a list of `quantity` elements, each equal to `number`, but it is not implemented and does not contribute to solving the problem.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program is incomplete and contains logical errors in `func_2`.
   - The function `func_3` is not implemented and does not contribute to solving the problem.
   - The program does not correctly handle the problem's requirements, especially the part about performing `k` operations to maximize the sum.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect due to the logical errors in `func_2` and the incomplete implementation of `func_3`. The provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
