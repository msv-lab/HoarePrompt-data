Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 5, `p[1]` is set to `ind`, `p[3]` is set to `ind + 2`, `ind` is increased by 2, `p[5]` is set to `ind`**

Explanation:
- `p[i]` is set to `ind`. Since `i` is 5, `p[5]` is set to `ind`.
- `ind` was previously increased by 2, so it is now `ind + 2`.
- The other conditions remain unchanged: `n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 5, `p[1]` is set to `ind`, and `p[3]` is set to `ind + 2`.
