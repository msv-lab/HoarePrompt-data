Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is reduced by `mi`, and the current value of `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `a[l] -= mi` reduces the value of `a[0]` by `mi`, where `l` is 0. The values of `l`, `r`, `k`, and `mi` remain unchanged. The condition that `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k` still holds true.
