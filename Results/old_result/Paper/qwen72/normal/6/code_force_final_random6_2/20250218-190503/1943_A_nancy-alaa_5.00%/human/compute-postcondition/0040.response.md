Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `_` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, and `first` is False. If `n-1` is not in `mpp` or `mpp[n-1]` is 1 and `first` is False, the loop will break. Otherwise, the loop completes all iterations.**
