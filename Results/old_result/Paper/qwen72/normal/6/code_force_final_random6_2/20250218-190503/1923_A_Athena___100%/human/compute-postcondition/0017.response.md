The code snippet `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` is 0 (as per the initial state), this element is removed. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, and `res`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list where all leading zeros have been removed and the last element of `a` has been removed, `res` is 0**
