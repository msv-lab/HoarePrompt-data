Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This means the user is prompted to input an integer, and it must be greater than 0. However, this input is not stored in a variable, so it doesn't affect the subsequent code.
   - `_` is a placeholder. This variable is not used in the code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output.
   - `n` is the new input integer greater than 0. This is another user input, but it is not used in the code snippet.
   - `a` is the new input string. This is the string input provided by the user.
   - `ans` is the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`.
   - `i` is the length of `a` minus 2. This variable is not used in the code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(ans)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `ans` is calculated as the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.
   - The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`.

Since the exact value of `a` is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the initial state, we know that `ans` will be the count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string a)**
