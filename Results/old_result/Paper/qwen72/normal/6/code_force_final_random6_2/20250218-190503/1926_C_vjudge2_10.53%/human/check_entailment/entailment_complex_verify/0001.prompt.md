You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of integers to be processed. It then reads `t` integers from user input and stores them in a list `numbers`. The function initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, with a length of `max(numbers) + 1` (if `numbers` is not empty) to store specific integer values and their cumulative sums, respectively. The first 10 elements of `values` and `sum_values` are set to the integers 0 through 9 and their cumulative sums, respectively. For each integer `i` from 10 to the maximum value in `numbers`, the function calculates the value at index `i` in `values` as the sum of the values at the indices corresponding to the last digit and the remainder of `i` when split into digits. The cumulative sum up to `i` is stored in `sum_values`. Finally, the function prints the cumulative sum for each integer in `numbers`. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the values of `n` for each test case. It stores these values in the list `numbers`.

2. **Initialization**: Two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, are initialized to store the sum of digits for each number and the cumulative sum of these values, respectively. The size of these lists is `max(numbers) + 1` to ensure they can hold values for the largest `n` in the test cases.

3. **Sum of Digits for Numbers 1 to 9**: The function correctly initializes the first 10 values in the `values` list, which are the numbers themselves since they are single-digit numbers. It also calculates the cumulative sum for these values and stores them in `sum_values`.

4. **Sum of Digits for Numbers 10 and Above**: The function iterates from 10 to `max(numbers) + 1` and calculates the sum of digits for each number. It does this by converting the number to a string, extracting the last digit and the remainder of the number (all digits except the last one), and using the precomputed values to find the sum of digits. This approach is efficient and avoids recalculating the sum of digits for each number from scratch.

5. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**: For each number `i` from 10 to `max(numbers) + 1`, the function updates the cumulative sum in `sum_values` by adding the current sum of digits to the previous cumulative sum.

6. **Output**: Finally, the function prints the cumulative sum for each `n` in the `numbers` list, which is the sum of the numbers on the board after the replacement process.

7. **Efficiency**: The function precomputes the sum of digits and cumulative sums up to the largest `n` in the test cases, which ensures that the output for each test case can be generated in constant time. This is crucial given the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case, especially when `t` can be as large as \(10^4\) and `n` can be as large as \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

8. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is 1, 2, 3, etc., where the sum of digits is simply the number itself.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and efficient for the given problem constraints.
