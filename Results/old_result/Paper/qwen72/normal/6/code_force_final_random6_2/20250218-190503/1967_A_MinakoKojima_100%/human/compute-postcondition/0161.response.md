Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first input integer greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `ans` is updated based on the condition: if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is set to the first element of `a` plus `dif`, and `res` is updated to `n - 2`; otherwise, `ans` is set to the first element of `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, `k` is set to 0, and `res` remains equal to `n - 1`. `ans_list` is a list that contains the updated value of `ans` as its last element, `i` is 0, and `dif` is the difference between the second and first elements of `a`, which is not 0. The current value of `k` is 0.**
