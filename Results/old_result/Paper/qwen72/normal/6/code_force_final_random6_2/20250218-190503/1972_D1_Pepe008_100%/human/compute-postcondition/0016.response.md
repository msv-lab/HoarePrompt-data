Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `suma` is the result of the expression `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2 + 1`, `i` is 2, `x` is the result of the expression `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `suma` is incremented by 1.
- The initial value of `suma` was `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2`, so after the increment, `suma` becomes `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2 + 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged.
