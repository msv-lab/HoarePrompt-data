The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `j` should be initialized to 0, and `n` should be greater than 1 to ensure the loop executes at least once.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is 0**
