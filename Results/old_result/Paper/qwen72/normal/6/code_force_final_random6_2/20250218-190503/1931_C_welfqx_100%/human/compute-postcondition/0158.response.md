Output State: **`onum` is reversed, `onum` is a copy of `num` but in reverse order, `ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is 1, `cn` is 2, `r` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where the first inequality was found, `symb1` is the first character of `num`, `symb2` is the first character of `onum`, `i` is 0, and the first character of `num` is equal to the second character of `num`.**
