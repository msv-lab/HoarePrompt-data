Output State: **`r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - len(ans)`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is now equal to `temp`, `temp` is a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '?', or containing all possible values of `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '1', or remains an empty set if `c` is '0' or neither '0', '1', nor '?'.**
