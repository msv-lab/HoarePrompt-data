Reasoning:  
The program attempts to solve the problem by considering two specific cases and a default case:

1. **Case when \( k = n \)**: The program generates an array of \( n \) ones. This is correct because all cyclic shifts of an array where all elements are the same will be sorted. For example, if \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \), the array \([1, 1]\) will have two sorted cyclic shifts: \([1, 1]\) and \([1, 1]\).

2. **Case when \( k = 1 \)**: The program generates an array with elements from 0 to \( n-1 \). This is correct because only the original array \([0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1]\) will be sorted, and all other cyclic shifts will not be sorted. For example, if \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 1 \), the array \([0, 1, 2]\) will have only one sorted cyclic shift: \([0, 1, 2]\).

3. **Default case (when \( k \neq 1 \) and \( k \neq n \))**: The program outputs \([-1]\). This is incorrect because the problem does not state that no solution exists for other values of \( k \). In fact, there are valid solutions for other values of \( k \). For example, if \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 2 \), a valid solution could be \([1, 2, 3, 1]\), which has two sorted cyclic shifts: \([1, 2, 3, 1]\) and \([1, 1, 2, 3]\).

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to handle the general case where \( k \) is neither 1 nor \( n \).

Correctness: **False**
