Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `[arr[0], 0, 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `segments_variants` remains a list containing a single element `[0, 0, -1]`.**
