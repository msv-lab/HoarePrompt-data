Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **_ is 2**: This variable is not used in the code snippet.
2. **t is greater than 0**: This variable is not used in the code snippet.
3. **l1 is a list of strings obtained from the input**: This means `l1` is a list of strings, and the input is not specified, so we need to infer the values based on the subsequent conditions.
4. **n is the integer value of the first element in l1**: `n` is the integer value of the first string in `l1`.
5. **k is 0**: `k` is initialized to 0.
6. **k0 is the integer value of the second element in l1 and must have at least one 1 in its binary representation**: `k0` is the integer value of the second string in `l1`, and its binary representation must contain at least one 1.
7. **i is the number of bits in the binary representation of k0**: `i` is the number of bits required to represent `k0` in binary.
8. **c is equal to n**: `c` is initialized to the value of `n`.
9. **ans is a list containing the values 1 << i for each i in arr**: `ans` is a list that contains the values of `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr`. However, `arr` is not defined in the initial state, so we need to assume it is an empty list or infer its values from the context.
10. **if c is equal to n - 1, ans also contains the value k0 - sum(ans)**: If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, then `ans` is extended to include the value `k0 - sum(ans)`.
11. **ans has been extended with (n - len(ans)) zeros**: `ans` is extended with zeros to ensure its length is equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `n` and `k0`**:
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`.
   - `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, and it must have at least one 1 in its binary representation.

2. **Calculate `i`**:
   - `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`.

3. **Initialize `ans`**:
   - `ans` is initially an empty list.

4. **Extend `ans` with values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr`**:
   - Since `arr` is not defined, we assume it is an empty list. Therefore, `ans` remains an empty list at this step.

5. **Check if `c` is equal to `n - 1`**:
   - `c` is equal to `n`.
   - If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, then `ans` is extended to include the value `k0 - sum(ans)`.
   - Since `c` is equal to `n`, this condition is not met, and `ans` remains an empty list.

6. **Extend `ans` with zeros**:
   - `ans` is extended with `(n - len(ans))` zeros.
   - Since `ans` is currently empty, it will be extended with `n` zeros.

### Final Output:
- `ans` will be a list of `n` zeros.

### Example:
- Suppose `l1 = ["3", "5"]`.
  - `n = 3`
  - `k0 = 5`
  - `i = 3` (since the binary representation of 5 is `101`, which has 3 bits)
  - `ans` is initially an empty list.
  - `c = 3`
  - The condition `c == n - 1` is not met.
  - `ans` is extended with `3` zeros.

### Output:
Output: **0 0 0** (where `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, and `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`)
