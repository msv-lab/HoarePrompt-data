Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` where `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must remain greater than 0, `T` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers, each element being the integer conversion of the corresponding user-provided input, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `t` is `k % 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
