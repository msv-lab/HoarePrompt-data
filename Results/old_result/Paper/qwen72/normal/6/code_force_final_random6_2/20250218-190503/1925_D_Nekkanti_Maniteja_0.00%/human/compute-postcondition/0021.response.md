Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 2, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is updated to `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the user over `m` iterations, `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated with the final values provided by the user in the last iteration, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `k` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are not affected by this code snippet.
- The conditions for `m` and `k` remain valid.
- The updated value of `s` is calculated using the current values of `c`, `i`, `m`, and `a`.
