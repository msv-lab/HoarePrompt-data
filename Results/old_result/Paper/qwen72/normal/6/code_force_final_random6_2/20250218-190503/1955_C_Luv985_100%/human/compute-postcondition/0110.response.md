Output State: **`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` or `a[n - 2]` depending on the value of `r`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `ans` is `ans + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is decremented by 1, so if `r` was `n - 1`, it is now `n - 2`. If `r` was `n - 2`, it is now `n - 3`. The values of `l`, `k`, `mi`, `a[0]`, `a[r]`, and `ans` remain unchanged except for the value of `r` being updated.
