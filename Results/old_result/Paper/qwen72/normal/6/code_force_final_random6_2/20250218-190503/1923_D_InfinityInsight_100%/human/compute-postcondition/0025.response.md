To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because `range(1, n)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\),
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 1,
- `left` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from 0,
- `last` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the same value before the current index, or -1 if the value has not been seen before,
- `ans` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is -1,
- `i` is the last element in `a`.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The variable `i` in the loop head is a loop index, not the last element of `a`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 and that `i` is initialized to 1 before the loop starts.

State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 1, `left` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from 0, `last` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the same value before the current index, or -1 if the value has not been seen before, `ans` is a list of length \(n\) where each element is -1, `i` is 1**
