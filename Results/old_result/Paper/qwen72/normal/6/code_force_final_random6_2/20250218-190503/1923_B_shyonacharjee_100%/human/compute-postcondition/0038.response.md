Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, where each tuple consists of an element from `x` and the corresponding element from `a`. `bullets_used` is 0. `can_survive` is True.**
