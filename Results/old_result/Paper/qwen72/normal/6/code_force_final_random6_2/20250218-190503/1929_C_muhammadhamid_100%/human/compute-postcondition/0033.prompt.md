Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, k, x, and a are integers for each test case where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    s = 1
    for i in range(x):
        s += s // (k - 1) + 1
    print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _ is 0, `k` and `a` are integers, `x` is an integer, `s` is the value after `x` iterations of the loop, `i` is `x - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is 1, `k` and `a` are integers, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s` is the result of the expression `1 + sum((s // (k - 1) + 1) for _ in range(x))` after `x` iterations, `i` is `x - 1`, the user input must be greater than `x`, `k` is the first integer from user input, `x` is the second integer from user input, `a` is the third integer from user input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 1, `k` is the first integer from user input, `x` is the second integer from user input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the third integer from user input, `s` is the result of the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` executed `x` times starting from `s = 2`, `i` is `x - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
