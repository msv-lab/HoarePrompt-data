Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers provided by the user input, `t` must be greater than 2, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains two integers `b` and `x` with `b` in {1, 2} and 1 <= `x` <= `n` for `b`=1 and 1 <= `x` <= 10^9 for `b`=2, `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user input, where each integer `k_i` is such that 1 <= `k_i` <= min(10^18, `c`) and `c` is the size of the array after all operations, `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `n, q = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `n` and `q`.
- The initial state already specifies that `n` and `q` are positive integers provided by the user input, so this remains valid.
- The other variables (`t`, `operations`, `queries`, `result`, `_`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their initial states remain unchanged.
