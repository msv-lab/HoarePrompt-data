Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the length of the list `N`.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `L`, `M`, `m`, `k`, `q`, and `N`) remain unchanged.
- `n` is now the number of elements in `N`, which is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`.
