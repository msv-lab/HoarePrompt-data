Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `T` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `lst` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
   - `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end.
   - `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k` and less than or equal to the number of elements in `ldb` times 2.
   - The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `ldb` must be a non-empty list.
   - `sng` must have at least one element.
   - `elem` is the first element in `sng`.
   - `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their previous element.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is printing the value of `elem`.
   - `elem` is defined as the first element in the list `sng`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`, and `sng` must have at least one element, the output will be the value of this first element followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the first element in the list sng)**
