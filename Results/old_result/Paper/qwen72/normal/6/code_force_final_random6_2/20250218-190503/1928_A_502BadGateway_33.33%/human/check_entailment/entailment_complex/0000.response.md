Reasoning:
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is an even number, which is not a sufficient condition to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the original one. According to the problem, Bob can form a different rectangle if and only if at least one of the dimensions `a` or `b` is even and greater than 1. This is because:

1. If both `a` and `b` are 1, no cut can be made.
2. If one of the dimensions is 1, the only possible cuts will result in rectangles that are the same as the original when rotated.
3. If one of the dimensions is even and greater than 1, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a different rectangle.

The provided function only checks if `b` is even, which is incorrect because it does not consider the case where `a` might be even and greater than 1, and it also does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are 1.

Correctness: **False**
