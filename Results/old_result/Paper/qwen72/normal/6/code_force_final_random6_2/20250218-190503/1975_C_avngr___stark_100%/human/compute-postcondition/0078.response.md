Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `n-3`, `_` is equal to `t`, `max` is the maximum value of the middle element in any sorted sub-list of 3 consecutive elements in `a` for each test case.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `t` remains the same as it was initially, within the range 1 to 500. For each iteration, `n` and `a` are redefined based on the input provided for that test case. The variable `i` is always `n-3` at the end of each inner loop, and the loop control variable `_` is equal to `t`, indicating that all iterations have completed. The variable `max` holds the maximum value among the second largest elements of all possible sorted sublists of length 3 in `a` for each test case. If `n` is 2, the loop prints the minimum value of `a` and `max` remains 0 for that iteration.
