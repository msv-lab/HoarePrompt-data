Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
   - `_` is 0.
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - `first` is False.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `i` is not a key in `mpp`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 0.
   - The condition that `i` is not a key in `mpp` does not affect the value of `i` itself, as `i` is already defined and does not change based on this condition.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 0.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **0**
