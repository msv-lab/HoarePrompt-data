Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- If `a < b < c`, the condition `a < b < c` is true.
- If `a < b` and `b > c`, the condition `a < b and b > c` is true.
- Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b and b > c` is true.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NONE')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NONE'`.
- The initial state provides conditions for the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement in the code snippet.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always output the string `'NONE'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output: **NONE**
