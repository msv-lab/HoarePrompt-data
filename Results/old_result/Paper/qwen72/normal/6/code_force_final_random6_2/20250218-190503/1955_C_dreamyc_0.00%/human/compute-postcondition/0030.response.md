Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `n` must be at least 2, `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15) and `k` must be non-zero, `nums` is a deque of `n-1` positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9) and `len(nums)` must be at least 2, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `a` is the second element of the original `nums` deque, `b` is the second-to-last element of the original `nums` deque, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 * `x`, `a` and `b` are each reduced by `x`, and `k` is updated to `k - 2 * x`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `nums.appendleft(a)` adds the value of `a` to the left side of the deque `nums`. This increases the length of `nums` by 1, making it `n-1` elements long. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
