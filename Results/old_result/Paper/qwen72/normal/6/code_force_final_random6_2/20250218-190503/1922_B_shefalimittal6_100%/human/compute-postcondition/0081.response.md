Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by `n`, `v[x]` is incremented by `n`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is `v[i] + v[i]`, `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `x` remains the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`.
- `idx` is still incremented by `n`.
- `v[x]` is still incremented by `n`.
- `i` remains 2.
- `cnt` is still `v[i] + v[i]`, which simplifies to `2 * v[i]`.
- `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `ans + 2 * v[i] * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, further simplifying to `ans + v[i] * v[i] * (v[i] - 1)`.
