Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len(arr)} \leq 2 \times 10^5\), and each element \(a_i\) in `arr` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq \text{len(arr)}\). If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is \(\text{len(arr)} - 2\), and the first element of `arr` (`arr[i-1]`) is equal to the last element of `arr` (`arr[j+1]`). Otherwise, `i` remains 0, `j` remains \(\text{len(arr)} - 1\), and `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`.***
