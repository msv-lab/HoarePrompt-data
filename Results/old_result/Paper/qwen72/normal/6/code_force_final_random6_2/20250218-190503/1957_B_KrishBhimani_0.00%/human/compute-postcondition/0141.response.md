Output State: **_ is t - 1, t is 0, l1 is a list of strings obtained from the input, n is the integer value of the first element in l1, k is 0, k0 is the integer value of the second element in l1, i is the number of bits in the binary representation of k0, arr contains all the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of k0, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing the values 1 << i for each i in arr, and if c is equal to n - 1, ans also contains the value k0 - sum(ans), and ans has been extended with (n - len(ans)) zeros.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has executed `t` times, so `_` is `t - 1`.
- The variable `t` is now 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input for the last test case.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1` for the last test case.
- `k` is 0, as the loop that processes the binary representation of `k0` has completed.
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` for the last test case.
- `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0` for the last test case.
- `arr` contains all the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` for the last test case.
- `c` is equal to `n`, indicating that the required number of elements have been added to `ans`.
- `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr`, and if `c` is equal to `n - 1`, the last element of `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)`. The list `ans` is then padded with zeros to make its length equal to `n` for the last test case.
