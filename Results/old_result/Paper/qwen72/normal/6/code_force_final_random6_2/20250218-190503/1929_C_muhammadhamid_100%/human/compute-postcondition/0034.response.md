The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts four parameters: `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers for each test case where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.

Since the function signature does not specify these parameters, we can infer that they might be passed in a different way, such as through a list or tuple of test cases. However, without more context on how these parameters are used within the function, we can only describe the parameters and the expected output based on the given constraints.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the example. Therefore, we will describe the parameters and the general idea that the function returns some value based on these parameters.
