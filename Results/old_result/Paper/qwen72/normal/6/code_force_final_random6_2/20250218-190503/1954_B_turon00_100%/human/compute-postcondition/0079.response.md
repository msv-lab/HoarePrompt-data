The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` equals `tmp`, `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is set to 0.**
