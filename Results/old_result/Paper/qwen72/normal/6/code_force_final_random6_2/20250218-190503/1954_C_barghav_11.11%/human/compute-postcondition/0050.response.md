The provided `print()` statement does not contain any arguments. When a `print()` statement is called without any arguments, it simply prints a newline character, which moves the cursor to the next line in the output.

Based on the initial state:
- The loop has printed all characters in `b` from index 0 to the last index.
- `i` has been redefined by the loop to be the last index of `b`.
- The state of `x`, `y`, `a`, and `t` remains unchanged.

However, none of these variables or objects are used in the `print()` statement. Therefore, the `print()` statement will only print a newline character.

Output: **(a blank line)**
