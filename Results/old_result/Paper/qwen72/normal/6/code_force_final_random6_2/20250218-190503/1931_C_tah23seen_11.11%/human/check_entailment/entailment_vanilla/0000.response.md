### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.
   - The function uses two pointers, `i` and `j`, starting from the beginning and the end of the array, respectively.
   - It checks if the elements at the two pointers are equal. If they are, it moves the pointers inward (`i += 1` and `j -= 1`).
   - If the pointers meet or cross each other (`i > j`), it means the array is already a palindrome, and no operation is needed, so it returns 0.
   - If the elements at the pointers are not equal, it breaks out of the loop.
   - After the loop, it checks if the element at `i` is equal to the next element (`arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`). If so, it increments `i` to skip over repeated elements.
   - Finally, it returns the length of the subarray that needs to be modified, which is `j - i + 1` if `j` is not the last index, otherwise `j - i`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Array**: If the array has only one element, the function correctly returns 0 because no operation is needed.
   - **All Elements Equal**: If all elements in the array are already equal, the function correctly returns 0.
   - **Palindrome Array**: If the array is a palindrome, the function correctly returns 0.
   - **Non-Palindrome Array**: The function correctly identifies the subarray that needs to be modified and returns the length of this subarray.

4. **Complexity**:
   - The function `func_1` runs in O(n) time complexity, which is efficient given the constraints.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle all the given test cases correctly and efficiently. It correctly identifies the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.

### Correctness:
**True**
