To determine what will be printed by the `print(s % M)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations involved step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\).
   - `i` is `k - 1`.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user.
   - `M` is \(1000000007\).
   - `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \times (n - 1) // 1\) modulo `M`.
   - `s` is updated to `s + c * (k - 1) * c * m + c * a`.
   - `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the user over `m` iterations.
   - `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated with the final values provided by the user in the last iteration.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - The input value must be greater than `k - 1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are user-provided integers.
   - `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \times (n - 1)\) modulo \(1000000007\). This means \(c\) is the integer such that \((n \times (n - 1) \times c) \equiv 1 \pmod{1000000007}\).
   - `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the user over `m` iterations.
   - `s` is updated using the formula `s + c * (k - 1) * c * m + c * a`.

3. **Calculating the Final Value of `s % M`:**
   - The value of `s` is updated to `s + c * (k - 1) * c * m + c * a`.
   - This can be simplified to `s + c^2 * (k - 1) * m + c * a`.
   - The final value printed will be the result of `s % M`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the `f` values are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `s % M`. However, we can describe the value of `s % M` based on the given operations and conditions.

Output: **s % M (where s is updated to s + c^2 * (k - 1) * m + c * a, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo 1000000007, and a is the sum of all f values provided by the user over m iterations)**
