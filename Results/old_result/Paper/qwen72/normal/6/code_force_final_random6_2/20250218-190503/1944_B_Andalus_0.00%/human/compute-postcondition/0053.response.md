To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `T` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` and `k` are input integers.
   - `lst` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
   - `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `ldb` must contain at least one element.
   - `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and not equal to their succeeding element, provided `i` is less than `n-1`.
   - `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` from index 1 to `n-1` that are equal to their preceding element.
   - `sz` is 2 if `k - sz >= 2`, otherwise `sz` remains 0.
   - If `sz` is 2, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - If `sz` is 0, the program continues executing the next statement after the if block.
   - `elem` is the next element in `ldb`.

2. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `ldb` must contain at least one element.
   - `elem` is the next element in `ldb`.
   - The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `elem` is the next element in `ldb`, and `ldb` contains at least one element, `elem` will be a specific integer value from `ldb`.
   - The exact value of `elem` is not provided, but it is known to be an integer from the list `ldb`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be the value of `elem` printed twice, followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the next element in the list `ldb`)**
