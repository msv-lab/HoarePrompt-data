Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to `a` and 2, `i` is 2, `x` is \((a - 2 \times 1) // 4 + 1\). If \((a - i \times (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \((i \times (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\), then `suma` is \((a - 2 \times 1) // 4 + 2\). Otherwise, `suma` remains \((a - 2 \times 1) // 4 + 1\).***
