The only variable in the loop head is `tickets_bought`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tickets_bought`. If `tickets_bought` is less than `k`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `tickets_bought` is 0, and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9). Since `tickets_bought` is 0, it is already less than `k`, so no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, and 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where 1 <= prices[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. `pq` is now a heap of tuples where each tuple contains a price from `prices` and its corresponding index, arranged such that the smallest price is at the root. `total_cost` is 0. `tickets_bought` is 0. `price_increase` is 0.**
