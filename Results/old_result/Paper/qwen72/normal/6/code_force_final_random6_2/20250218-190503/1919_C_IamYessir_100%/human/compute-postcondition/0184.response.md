Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are lists, `s` is 0. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `a` contains `lit[1]` as its last element, and `x` is set to `lit[1]`. If `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` contains `lit[1]` as its last element, and `x` is set to `lit[1]`. If `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` contains `lit[1]` as its last element, and `y` is set to `lit[1]`. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity.***
