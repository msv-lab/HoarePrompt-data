Output State: **`t` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000 and `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, `n` and `q` are positive integers provided by the user input, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains two integers `b` and `x` with `b` in {1, 2} and 1 <= `x` <= `n` for `b`=1 and 1 <= `x` <= 10^9 for `b`=2, `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user input, where each integer `k_i` is such that 1 <= `k_i` <= min(10^18, `c`) and `c` is the size of the array after all operations, `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)` for each iteration, `_` is the number of iterations minus 1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` must have been a positive integer between 1 and 5000, and the loop must have executed `t` times.
- For each iteration, the variables `n` and `q` were provided by the user input, and they represent positive integers.
- The variable `operations` was a list of `n` lists, where each sublist contains two integers `b` and `x` with `b` being either 1 or 2, and `x` being within the specified ranges depending on the value of `b`.
- The variable `queries` was a list of `q` positive integers, each of which was within the range 1 to the minimum of 10^18 and `c`, where `c` is the size of the array after all operations.
- The variable `result` contains the value returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)` for each iteration.
- The variable `_` is the number of iterations minus 1, which means it will be `t - 1` after the loop has completed.
