Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Frequency Counting**: The program starts by counting the frequency of each element in the array `arr` using a list `freq`. This is done with the loop:
   ```python
   freq = [0] * (n + 1)
   for i in arr:
       freq[i] += 1
   ```

2. **Optimal Strategy**: The game's score is determined by the MEX of the array `c` after all elements have been chosen. The optimal strategy involves Alice and Bob making choices that either maximize or minimize the MEX, respectively. The key insight is that the MEX of the final array `c` will be the smallest integer that appears fewer than twice in the original array `arr`.

3. **Finding the MEX**: The program then iterates through the frequency list to find the smallest integer `i` that either:
   - Does not appear at all (`freq[i] == 0`), or
   - Appears exactly once (`freq[i] == 1`), and there is another integer that also appears exactly once (`cou == 2`).

   This is done with the loop:
   ```python
   cou = 0
   for i in range(n + 1):
       if freq[i] >= 2:
           continue
       if freq[i] == 1:
           cou += 1
       if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
           print(i)
           break
   ```

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case independently, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.

The program correctly identifies the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally, and it handles the constraints and input format as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
