The only objects in the loop head are variables `t` and `test`. The loop can execute again if `t` is less than `test`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1 and `test` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `test` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `test` must be greater than 2, and `t` is 2. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the condition holds. If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the condition also holds.**
