Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. Additionally, it should take a list `a` of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function should return two lists `l` and `r`, each of length 2k, where `l` is a subset of the first half of `a` and `r` is a subset of the second half of `a`, and the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `r`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    l = [0] * n
    r = [0] * n
    re = ul = ur = 0
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        l[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n, 2 * n):
        r[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
            print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
            l[a[i] - 1] = 0
            ul += 2
        if ul == k * 2:
            break
    k = 2 * k - ul
    if k:
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                print(a[i], end=' ')
                re += 1
                res.append(a[i])
            if re == k:
                break
    print()
    for i in res:
        print(i, end=' ')
    if ul != ur:
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                r[a[i] - 1] = 0
                ur += 2
            if ul == ur:
                break
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`res` must contain all its elements, and the loop has printed all elements in `res` with no elements left to print. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `i` is `2 * n - 1`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is either 0 or remains unchanged, and `ur` is increased by 2 for each element in `a` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` where `r[a[i] - 1]` was initially 2. If `ul` becomes equal to `ur` at any point, the loop breaks and `i` is the index at which this condition was met. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`res` is a non-empty list, and the loop has printed all elements of `res` separated by spaces. If `ul` and `ur` are not equal, and `n` is greater than 0, then `i` is set to `2 * n - 1`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2 for any `i` in the range `n` to `2 * n - 1`, then `ur` is updated to `ur + 2` for each such `i`, and the corresponding elements in `r` are set to 0. If `ul` is equal to `ur` at any point, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list containing elements from `a` based on certain conditions, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is the last index where the loop executed or broke, `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` (from the first `n` elements) that were equal to 2 in `l` and were reset to 0, `ur` is the total number of elements in `a` (from the `n` to `2 * n` elements) that were equal to 2 in `r` and were reset to 0, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, the loop completes all iterations. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
