Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `p` is a list where `p[0]` is `n`, `p[2]` is `n-2`, `p[4]` is `n-4`, and so on, with all even indices filled with decreasing values starting from `n` and decreasing by 2, `p[1]` is 1 if `n` is odd, and `p[1]` is 2 if `n` is even, `p[3]` is 3 if `n` is odd, and `p[3]` is 4 if `n` is even, `ind` is 5 if `n` is odd, and 6 if `n` is even.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ind` is incremented by 2.
- If `n` is odd, `ind` was initially 3, so it becomes 5.
- If `n` is even, `ind` was initially 4, so it becomes 6.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
