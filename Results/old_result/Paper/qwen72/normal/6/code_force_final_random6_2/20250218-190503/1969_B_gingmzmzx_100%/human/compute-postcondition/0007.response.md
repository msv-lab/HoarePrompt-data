Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string and must have at least one element, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list with values [0, 0] where `cnt[c]` is now `cnt[c] + 1`, `ans` is 0, `c` is the first element of `s`**

Explanation:
- `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1. Since `c` is the first element of `s`, the value of `cnt[c]` is now `cnt[c] + 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
