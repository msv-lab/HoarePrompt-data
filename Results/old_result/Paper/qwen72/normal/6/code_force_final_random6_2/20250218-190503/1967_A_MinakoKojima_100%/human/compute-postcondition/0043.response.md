Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dif` is the difference between the third and the second element of the list `a`. If `k == 0`, `ans` and `res` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `dif` is 0, `ans` remains equal to the first element of the list `a` and `res` remains equal to `n - 1`. If `k >= dif * (i + 1)` and `k >= dif * 2`, `ans` is equal to the first element of the list `a` plus `2 * dif` and `res` is equal to `n - 4`. If `k >= dif * (i + 1)` and `k < dif * 2`, `ans` is equal to the first element of the list `a` plus `dif` and `res` is equal to `n - 3`. If `k < dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is updated to `ans + k // 2` and `res` is either `n - 3 + k % 2` if `k >= dif * 2` or `n - 2 + k % 2` otherwise.***
