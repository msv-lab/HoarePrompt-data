### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Inside `func_1`, it reads the integer `n` for the current test case using `int(input())`.
   - It creates a list `a` containing the integers from 1 to `n` using `list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))`.

3. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based) of the list `a` using `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]`.
   - This means that the elements at indices 0, 2, 4, etc., are reversed in their order.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the modified list `a`.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The problem requires a permutation of length `n` such that there do not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - By reversing the elements at even indices, the program ensures that the elements at even indices are no longer in their original order, which helps in breaking the divisibility pattern.
   - For example, if `n = 4`, the original list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. After reversing the even indices, the list becomes `[4, 2, 3, 1]`. This permutation does not have any two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - Similarly, for `n = 3`, the original list is `[1, 2, 3]`. After reversing the even indices, the list becomes `[3, 2, 1]`. This permutation also does not have any two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, including the range of `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, which is within the constraints.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State of the program right before the function call**: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- **Inside `func_1`**:
  - `a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))` creates a list of integers from 1 to `n`.
  - `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at even indices.
  - **State after reversing even indices**: The elements at even indices are reversed, and the list contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
  - **Example for `n = 5`**: The original list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. After reversing the even indices, the list becomes `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.

### Validation:
- **Example for `n = 4`**:
  - Original list: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
  - After reversing even indices: `[4, 2, 3, 1]`
  - Check divisibility:
    - `p_1 = 4` does not divide `p_3 = 3`
    - `p_2 = 2` does not divide `p_4 = 1`
    - `p_1 = 4` does not divide `p_2 = 2`
    - `p_3 = 3` does not divide `p_4 = 1`
  - No two distinct indices `i` and `j` satisfy the divisibility condition.

- **Example for `n = 3`**:
  - Original list: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - After reversing even indices: `[3, 2, 1]`
  - Check divisibility:
    - `p_1 = 3` does not divide `p_2 = 2`
    - `p_2 = 2` does not divide `p_3 = 1`
  - No two distinct indices `i` and `j` satisfy the divisibility condition.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a permutation that satisfies the given conditions. The approach of reversing the elements at even indices effectively breaks the divisibility pattern required by the problem.

Final: **True**
