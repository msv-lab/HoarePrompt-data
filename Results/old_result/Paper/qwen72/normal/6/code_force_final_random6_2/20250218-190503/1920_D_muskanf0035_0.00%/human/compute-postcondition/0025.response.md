The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the initial size of an array.
- `operations` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `(op_type, value)`. `op_type` is either 1 or 2, and `value` is a positive integer. If `op_type` is 1, then `1 <= value <= n`. If `op_type` is 2, then `1 <= value <= 10^9`.
- `queries` is a list of positive integers, where each integer `k` satisfies `1 <= k <= min(10^18, c)`, and `c` is the size of the array after all operations have been applied.

The function returns a list `result` containing the elements at indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`, where `array` has been modified according to the operations specified in the list `operations`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list of operations where each operation is a tuple `(op_type, value)`, and a list of queries. It returns a list `result` where each element is the value at the index `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each query `k`, after the array has been modified according to the operations.**
