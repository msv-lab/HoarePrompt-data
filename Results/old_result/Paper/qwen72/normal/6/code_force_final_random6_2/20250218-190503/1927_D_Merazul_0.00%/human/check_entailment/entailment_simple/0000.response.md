Reasoning:

The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem requires finding pairs of indices (i, j) within a range [l, r] such that the elements at these indices are different. However, the program seems to be attempting to solve a different problem, possibly related to checking if elements from one set are present in another set and performing some bitwise operations. The function `func()` does not address the core requirements of the problem, such as handling the array and the queries correctly.

Here are the specific issues:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input using a lambda function `R` but does not correctly parse the input for the array and queries. It reads the array and queries into sets `a` and `b`, which is not appropriate for the problem.
2. **Logic**: The logic inside the loop is not aligned with the problem's requirements. It uses bitwise operations and set membership checks that do not correspond to finding pairs of different elements within a specified range.
3. **Output**: The output format does not match the expected output for the problem. The program prints 'YNEOS' based on some conditions, which is not the correct format for the problem that requires indices or -1 -1.

Given these discrepancies, the program is incorrect for the specified problem.

Correctness: **False**
