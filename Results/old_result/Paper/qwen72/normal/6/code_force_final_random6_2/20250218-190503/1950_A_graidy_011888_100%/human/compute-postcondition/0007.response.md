The provided `print` statement simply prints the string `'PEAK'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i`) and their conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string literal `'PEAK'`.

Output: **PEAK**
