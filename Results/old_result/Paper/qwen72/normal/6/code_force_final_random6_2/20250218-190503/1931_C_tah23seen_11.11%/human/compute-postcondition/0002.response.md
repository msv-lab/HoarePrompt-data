To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given program state and the `while` loop condition.

### Program State:
- `arr` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len(arr)} \leq 2 \times 10^5\), and each element \(a_i\) in `arr` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq \text{len(arr)}\).
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is \(\text{len(arr)} - 1\).

### Loop Condition:
```
while i <= j:
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `i` is less than or equal to `j`.
- Right before the loop, `i` is 0 and `j` is \(\text{len(arr)} - 1\).
- Since `len(arr)` is at least 1, `j` will be at least 0.
- Therefore, `i` (which is 0) will always be less than or equal to `j` (which is at least 0).

### Conclusion:
- The loop condition `i <= j` is already satisfied with the given initial values of `i` and `j`.
- No adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len(arr)} \leq 2 \times 10^5\), and each element \(a_i\) in `arr` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq \text{len(arr)}\); `i` is 0; `j` is \(\text{len(arr)} - 1\)**.
