Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and `arr` must have at least one element. `i` is 0. `new_segment` is true. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`. Otherwise, `max_segment[0]` is also updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[0]`.***
