### Reasoning:

1. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not calculate the MEX of the selected subarray. The function `func_1` attempts to maximize the sum by replacing subarrays with the square of their length, which is not the correct approach for the MEX operation. The MEX operation requires finding the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, and then replacing the subarray with this value.

2. **Operation Limit**:
   - The original assessment also correctly identifies that the program does not ensure that the operations are performed no more than 5 * 10^5 times. The recursive calls in `func_2` and `func_3` can lead to an excessive number of operations. This is a significant issue because the problem constraints specify that the number of operations should not exceed 5 * 10^5.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The original assessment correctly notes that the program does not output the maximum sum and the number of operations as required. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` only return the modified list and the operations list, but they do not print the required output format. The program should output the maximum sum and the number of operations in the first line, followed by the operations in subsequent lines.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the array is already optimal (like in the second example where the initial sum is 13), the program should output 0 operations, but it does not do that. The program's approach of replacing subarrays with the square of their length will not work in such cases.

### Specific Case Analysis:
- **Input**:
  ```
  3
  1 3 9
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  13 0
  ```
- **Actual Output**:
  - The program will not produce the correct output because it does not correctly calculate the MEX and does not handle the case where no operations are needed. The expected output is 13 with 0 operations, but the program will likely produce a different result due to its incorrect approach.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the MEX operation, does not ensure the operation limit, does not handle the output format correctly, and does not handle edge cases properly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
