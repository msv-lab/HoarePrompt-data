The code snippet `lft.sort()` sorts the list `lft` in ascending order. Since `lft` is already a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, sorting it again will not change its contents. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` (unchanged), `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until `sz` reaches `k`, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to the negative of the number of elements in `sng` that were processed, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop breaks out.**
