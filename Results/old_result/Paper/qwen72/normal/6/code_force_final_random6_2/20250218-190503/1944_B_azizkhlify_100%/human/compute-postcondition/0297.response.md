Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `res` is a list containing elements from `a` based on certain conditions.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `r` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` (from the first `n` elements) that were equal to 2 in `l` and were reset to 0.
   - `ur` remains 0.
   - `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
   - The element at index `a[i] - 1` in `r` is equal to 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is set to `n`.
   - The print statement is printing the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space.

4. **Determine the Value of `a[i]`:**
   - Since `i` is `n`, we need to determine the value of `a[n]`.
   - The initial state mentions that `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is `n`.
   - The element at index `a[i] - 1` in `r` is equal to 2. This means `r[a[n] - 1] == 2`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that `r[a[n] - 1] == 2`, `a[n]` must be an index in `r` that points to the value 2.
   - Therefore, `a[n]` must be an integer such that `r[a[n] - 1] == 2`.

Since `a[n]` is an integer and `r[a[n] - 1] == 2`, the value of `a[n]` is the index in `r` that points to the value 2. Let's denote this value as `x`.

Output: **x x (where x is the value of a[n] such that r[a[n] - 1] == 2)**
