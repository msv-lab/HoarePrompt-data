Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0. If the length of `a` is 0, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is set to infinity. If the length of `b` is greater than 0, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. `x` is less than or equal to `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, `a` has one more element, which is `lit[0]`. If `x` is less than `y` and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of `a` and `y` remains the last element of `b` if the length of `b` is greater than 0, otherwise `y` is infinity. If `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` has `lit[i]` appended to it. If `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` but greater than `x`, `b` has `lit[i]` appended to it. Otherwise, the state of `b` remains unchanged.***
