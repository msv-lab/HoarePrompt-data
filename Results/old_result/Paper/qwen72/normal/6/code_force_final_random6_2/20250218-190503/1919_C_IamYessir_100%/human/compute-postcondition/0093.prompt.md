Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0. If `x` is greater than `y`, and `y` is infinity, `b` remains an empty list. If `y` is not infinity and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[0]`, `b` is a non-empty list containing the first element of `lit`, and `y` is the last element of `b` (which is `lit[0]`). If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` is a non-empty list with `lit[i]` appended to it, and `y` is the last element of `b` before the new append. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, if `a` was an empty list, `a` is now a list containing `lit[i]`, and `x` is `lit[i]`. If `a` was a non-empty list, `a` is a list with `lit[i]` appended to it, and `x` is `lit[i]`. `x` is always greater than `y` after the execution, unless the condition `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y` is not met, in which case the variables and lists remain unchanged. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, and `x` is equal to `y`, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, and `x` is the first element of `lit`, while `b` remains unchanged. If `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` is a non-empty list with the last element being `lit[i]`, and `x` is the last element of `a`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `b` is an empty list, `y` is infinity, and `a` is a non-empty list with the last element being `lit[i]`, and `x` is the last element of `a`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x`, `b` now contains the element `lit[i]`, and the new value of `y` is equal to `lit[i]`. In all cases, `x` is less than `y` unless the condition `x < y` is not met, in which case the original values of `x` and `y` are retained.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. If `lit` is an empty list, `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is positive infinity. If `b` is not an empty list, `y` is not modified. If `x > y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to the second element of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit`. Otherwise, if the second element of `lit` is greater than `x` and `y`, `a` is a list that now includes the second element of `lit`. If `x` is not greater than `y`, and `x` is equal to `y`, `a` is a list that now includes the second element of `lit`. If `x` is less than `y` and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]`, `a` is a list containing the second element of `lit`. If `lit[1]` is greater than `y` and `lit[1]` is greater than `x`, `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a` or `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, and `cp` is 0. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x > y`, then: if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]`, `b` is updated to include `lit[2]` as its last element, and `y` is set to this new last element of `b`. If `lit[2]` is greater than `x`, `b` is updated to include `lit[2]` as its last element, and `y` is set to this new last element of `b`. If `lit[2]` is less than or equal to `x` and greater than `y`, `a` is updated to include `lit[2]` as its last element, and `x` is set to this new last element of `a`. If `x ≤ y`, then: if `x == y`, `a` now contains the element `lit[2]` appended to it, and `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[2]`), while `y` remains positive infinity if `b` is an empty list or retains its last element if `b` is not empty. If `x < y`, then: if `x` ≥ `lit[2]`, `a` now includes the third element of `lit` as its last element, and `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[2]`). If `x` < `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` > `y`, `a` now includes the third element of `lit` as its last element, and `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[2]`). If `x` < `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` ≤ `y` and `lit[2]` > `x`, `b` now contains the element `lit[2]` appended to it, and `y` is the last element of `b` (which is `lit[2]` if `b` was initially empty). If `x` < `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` ≤ `y` and `lit[2]` ≤ `x`, `b` remains unchanged and `y` retains its initial value. If `x` ≥ `y`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
