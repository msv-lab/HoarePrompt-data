Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` is the last value of `y` that was not an empty list in `lst`, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the execution, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `lst[x]` is now empty, `s` is False
Code of the loop:
while lst[x]:
    y = lst[x].pop()
    if lst[y] != []:
        x = y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` is the last value of `y` that was not an empty list in `lst`, `y` is the second-to-last element of `lst[x]` (or `y` is None if `lst[x]` was a single-element list), `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `lst[x]` is now non-empty, `s` is False. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `lst[x]` is now one element shorter, `s` is False. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `lst[x]` is now one element shorter but not empty, `s` is False. If `lst[y]` is not empty, `x` is now equal to `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `x` and `y` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
