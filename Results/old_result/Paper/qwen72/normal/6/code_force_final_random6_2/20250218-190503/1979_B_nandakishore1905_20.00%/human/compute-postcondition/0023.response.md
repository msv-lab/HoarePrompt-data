The given Python code snippet is:
```
print(1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\) and \(x \neq y\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `1`.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.
   - The value `1` is a constant and will be printed as is.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
