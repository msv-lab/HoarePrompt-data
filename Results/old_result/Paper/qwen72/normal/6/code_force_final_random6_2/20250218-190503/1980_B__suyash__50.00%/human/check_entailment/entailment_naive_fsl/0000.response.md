Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical flaw in how it handles the removal of cubes. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the program counts the number of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube and how it determines if the favorite cube is removed. Here's a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
MAYBE
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation:**
- The favorite cube is the second cube with a value of 3.
- After sorting the cubes in non-increasing order, the list could be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]` or `[4, 3, 3, 2, 3]`.
- In the first possible sorted list, the favorite cube is in the second position and will be removed.
- In the second possible sorted list, the favorite cube is in the third position and will not be removed.
- Therefore, the correct output should be "MAYBE" because the favorite cube may or may not be removed.
- However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" in this case.

This indicates that the program does not correctly handle the scenario where the favorite cube could be in multiple positions after sorting, leading to incorrect results.
