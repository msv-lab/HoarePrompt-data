Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list, `b` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `x` is positive infinity if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the first element of `lit`, `s` is 0, and `y` is greater than or equal to the first element of `lit`. Additionally, `x` is greater than `y`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b.append(lit[i])` adds the first element of `lit` to the list `b`.
- Since `i` is 0, `lit[i]` is the first element of `lit`.
- The value of `y` is now the first element of `lit` because `b` now contains the first element of `lit`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
