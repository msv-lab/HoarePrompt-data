Output State: **`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` or `a[n - 2]` depending on the value of `r`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `ans` is `ans + 1`.**

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The values of `l`, `r`, `k`, `mi`, `a[0]`, and `a[r]` remain unchanged. If `a[l]` was 0, then `l` is 1 and `ans` was already incremented by 1 in the precondition. Now, `ans` is incremented by an additional 1. If `a[l]` was not 0, `l` remains 0, and `ans` is incremented by 1 from its initial value.
