Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and must have at least 1 element, `m` is greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace. If `c` is '0', `temp` remains an empty set. If `c` is '1', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`. If `c` is '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`. If `c` is neither '0', '1', nor '?', `temp` remains an empty set.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variables `n`, `m`, and `x` retain their initial values as returned by `func_3()`.
- The set `ans` must contain at least one element, and it remains unchanged after the loop.
- The variable `m` must be greater than 0, and it remains unchanged.
- The variable `r` is an integer and remains unchanged.
- The variable `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, and it remains unchanged.

- The set `temp` is updated based on the value of `c`:
  - If `c` is '0', `temp` remains an empty set.
  - If `c` is '1', `temp` contains the values `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`.
  - If `c` is '?', `temp` contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`.
  - If `c` is neither '0', '1', nor '?', `temp` remains an empty set.

This output state reflects the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
