### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` without passing any arguments. This is correct because `func_1` reads its input directly from the standard input, which is the expected behavior for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Processing in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` reads a binary string `s` from the input and converts it into a list of integers.
   - It initializes `n` and `ans` to 0. `n` will keep track of the number of 1s encountered so far, and `ans` will accumulate the cost of the operations.
   - The function iterates over the list `s`:
     - If the current element is 1, it increments `n`.
     - If the current element is 0 and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. This is because each 0 that comes after at least one 1 requires a cyclic shift of the substring starting from the first 1 to the current 0, and the cost of this shift is `n + 1`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function `func_1` prints the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order, which is the sum of `n + 1` for each 0 that comes after at least one 1.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string by considering the cost of cyclic shifts for each 0 that comes after at least one 1.
   - The cost calculation is based on the number of 1s encountered before the 0, which is a valid approach for the problem.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For a string with only 0s, the cost is 0, which is correct.
   - For a string with only 1s, the cost is 0, which is correct.
   - For a string that is already sorted, the cost is 0, which is correct.
   - For a string that requires multiple cyclic shifts, the cost is correctly calculated as the sum of the lengths of the substrings shifted.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using the described cyclic shift operations. The input and output handling are also correct for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
