Output State: **`i` is `2 * n - 1`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is either 0 or remains unchanged, and `ur` is increased by 2 for each element in `a` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` where `r[a[i] - 1]` was initially 2. If `ul` becomes equal to `ur` at any point, the loop breaks and `i` is the index at which this condition was met.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1`.
- For each iteration, if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, the loop prints `a[i]` twice, sets `r[a[i] - 1]` to 0, and increases `ur` by 2.
- If `ul` becomes equal to `ur` at any point during the loop, the loop breaks immediately, and `i` will be the index at which this condition was met.
- After all iterations (or when the loop breaks), `i` will be the last index that was processed, which is `2 * n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking.
- The values of `r[a[i] - 1]` for the elements processed by the loop will be 0 if they were initially 2, otherwise, they will remain unchanged.
- The value of `ur` will be increased by 2 for each element in `a` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` where `r[a[i] - 1]` was initially 2.
