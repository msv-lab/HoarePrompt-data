Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `h` is `h - 12`, `m` is an integer representing the minute from the input string in the format 'HH:MM', `day` is 'PM' if `h` was greater than 12, otherwise `day` is 'AM'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `h` is updated to `h - 12`.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1.
- The value of `m` remains the same as it was not affected by the code.
- The value of `day` is determined by the previous value of `h`: if `h` was greater than 12, `day` is 'PM'; otherwise, `day` is 'AM'.
