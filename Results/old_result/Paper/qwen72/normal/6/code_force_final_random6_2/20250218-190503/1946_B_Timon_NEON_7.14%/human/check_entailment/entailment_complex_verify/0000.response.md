### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Correctness**: This function correctly computes the remainder of a number when divided by \(10^9 + 7\). It is used to ensure the final answer is within the required range.
   - **Usage**: The function is called at the end of the main loop to print the final result, which is correct.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function is intended to find the segment with the maximum sum from all possible contiguous subarrays of the input array `arr`.
   - **Logic**:
     - The function iterates through the array and tries to identify contiguous segments with positive sums.
     - It maintains `new_segment` to track the current segment being considered and `max_segment` to track the maximum segment found so far.
     - It also maintains a list `segments_variants` to store all segments found.
     - After the loop, it appends the last `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants`.
     - It then finds the segment with the maximum sum in `segments_variants` and returns it.
   - **Issues**:
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where all elements in the array are negative. It should return the maximum sum of any subarray, which could be zero (an empty subarray).
     - The function appends `new_segment` and `max_segment` to `segments_variants` even if they are empty or invalid, which can lead to incorrect results.
     - The function does not handle the case where the entire array is negative correctly. It should return the maximum sum of any subarray, which is zero.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - **Processing Each Test Case**:
     - It reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
     - It reads the array `a`.
     - It calls `func_2` to find the maximum segment.
     - If the maximum segment sum is -1, it sets it to 0 (indicating an empty subarray).
     - It calculates the final answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
     - It prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using `func_1`.
   - **Issues**:
     - The formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` is incorrect. The correct formula should be `max_segment[0] * (2 ** k - 1) + sum(a)`.
     - The function `func_3` is defined but not used, and it does not perform any operations related to the problem.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the logic for selecting and inserting subarrays.
   - The formula for calculating the maximum possible sum after `k` operations is incorrect.
   - The function `func_3` is redundant and not used in the program.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct. The program is incomplete and does not fully implement the solution for the given problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
