Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (4 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `sm` is the sum of the first element of `lst` plus the sum of elements from the fifth element to the end of `lst` plus 16, `over_sum` is updated to `sm`, `r` is [1, 4], and `l` is [1, 4].**

Explanation: The code snippet `over_sum = sm` updates the value of `over_sum` to be equal to `sm`. Since `sm` is the sum of the first element of `lst` plus the sum of elements from the fifth element to the end of `lst` plus 16, `over_sum` now holds this value. The variables `r` and `l` are updated to [1, 4] because the condition `sm > over_sum` is true after the assignment. The values of `lst`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
