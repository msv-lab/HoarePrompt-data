The variables in the loop head are `a` and the condition `a[-1] == 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still be a non-empty list and its last element must be 0. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a non-empty list where all leading zeros have been removed and the last element of `a` has been removed. To ensure the loop can execute again, the last element of `a` must now be 0, and `a` must still be non-empty.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list where all leading zeros have been removed and the last element of `a` is 0, `res` is 0**
