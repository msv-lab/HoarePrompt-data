### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' if it is not. The value of `a` is not used in the function and does not affect the return value.

2. **Problem Requirements**:
   - Bob can cut the rectangle \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - Bob can then try to form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles.
   - The new rectangle must be different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle, considering that rotations of the same dimensions are considered the same.

3. **Evaluation of the Program**:
   - The program only checks if `b` is even. This is insufficient because:
     - If `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) rectangles, but this does not guarantee that he can form a new rectangle different from the original.
     - If `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) rectangles, and this could potentially allow him to form a new rectangle different from the original.
   - The program does not consider the possibility of cutting along the `a` dimension.
   - The program does not check if the resulting rectangles can be combined to form a new rectangle different from the original.

4. **Counterexamples**:
   - For \(a = 1\) and \(b = 4\), the program outputs "No" because `b` is even. However, the correct output should be "Yes" because the rectangle can be cut into two \(1 \times 2\) rectangles, which can then be used to form a \(2 \times 2\) rectangle.
   - For \(a = 4\) and \(b = 1\), the program outputs "No" because `b` is not even. However, the correct output should be "Yes" because the rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 1\) rectangles, which can then be used to form a \(2 \times 2\) rectangle.

5. **Correct Solution**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, the program should check if either `a` or `b` is even. If either dimension is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and potentially form a new rectangle different from the original.
   - The correct function should be:
     ```python
     def func_1(a, b):
         return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
     ```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program provided does not correctly determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
