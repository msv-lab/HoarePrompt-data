The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new list `a`, `i` is 2. If `a[i-1]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and 1.**
