The only variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `l <= r`. Right before the loop, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`. Since `n` is the length of the `array` and `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `r` will always be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the condition `l <= r` will always be true for the first iteration because `l` starts at 0 and `r` is at least 0 (when `n` is 1) and can be up to `n - 1`.

Since the condition `l <= r` is guaranteed to be true for the first iteration, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`n` is equal to the length of the `array`, `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and all elements in `array` are distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`**
