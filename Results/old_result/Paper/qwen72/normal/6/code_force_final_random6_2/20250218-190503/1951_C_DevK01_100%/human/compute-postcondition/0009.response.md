Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.**

Explanation:
- `n` is updated to the length of `N`.
- `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.
- `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.
- `k` is `L[2]`.
- `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `L`, and `M` remain unchanged.
- The value of `n` is now the number of elements in `N`, which is `q`.
