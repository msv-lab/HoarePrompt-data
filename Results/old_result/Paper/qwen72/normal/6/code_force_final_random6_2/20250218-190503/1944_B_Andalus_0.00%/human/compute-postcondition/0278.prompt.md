Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is `T - 1`, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` (unchanged), `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until `sz` reaches `k`, `rdb` is an empty list, `ldb` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, and `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their preceding or succeeding element, and `sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until `sz` reaches `k`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
        rdb.append(rgt[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the second element of `rgt` is equal to the first element of `rgt`, `rdb` now contains the first element of `rgt`. Otherwise, `rdb` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If the second element of `rgt` is equal to the first element of `rgt`, `rdb` now contains the first element of `rgt`. Otherwise, `rdb` remains unchanged except for the addition of the second element of `rgt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `rdb` has a new element which is `rgt[3]`. Otherwise, the state of `rdb` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
