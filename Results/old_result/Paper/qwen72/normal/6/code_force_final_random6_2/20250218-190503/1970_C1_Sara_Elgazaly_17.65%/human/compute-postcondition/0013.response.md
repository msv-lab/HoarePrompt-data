Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` is an integer provided by the user and must be greater than 1, `y` is an integer provided by the user, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as the last element, `lst[b]` now contains `a` as the last element and `a` as the new last element.**

Explanation:
- The code `lst[b].append(a)` adds `a` as the new last element to the list `lst[b]`.
- Before the code execution, `lst[b]` already contained `a` as the last element.
- After the code execution, `a` is appended again, so `lst[b]` now has `a` as both the second-to-last and the last elements.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
