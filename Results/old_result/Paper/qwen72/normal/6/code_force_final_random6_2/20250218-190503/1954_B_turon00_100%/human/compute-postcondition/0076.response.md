The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `ans` and `cnt`, we can only state that `ans` is now the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.**
