Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`, `n * m` equals `k`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**

Explanation:
- The variable `cost` is calculated using the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
- `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`, where `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.
- `sum(N)` is the sum of the first `q` elements of `M`.
- The expression `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` calculates the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series with the first term `m` and common difference `m`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged.
- The value of `cost` is now `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
