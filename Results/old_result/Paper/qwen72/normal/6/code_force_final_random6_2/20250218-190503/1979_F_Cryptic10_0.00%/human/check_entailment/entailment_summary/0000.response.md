Reasoning:

The problem requires finding a Hamiltonian path in a modified complete undirected graph with \( n \) vertices, where \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed. The key to solving this problem is to use the interactive queries to identify and remove vertices in a way that allows us to construct the path.

### Function 1 (`func_1`):
- **Purpose**: Sends a query to the interactor and receives the response.
- **Behavior**: It prints a query string in the format `? d` and reads two integers `v` and `u` from the standard input.
- **Correctness**: This function is correct as it follows the problem's interaction rules and correctly handles the input and output.

### Function 2 (`func_2`):
- **Purpose**: Constructs a Hamiltonian path by iteratively querying the interactor and removing vertices.
- **Behavior**:
  - It initializes an empty path and a set of remaining vertices.
  - It enters a loop that continues until there are no remaining vertices.
  - For each iteration, it queries the interactor with a decreasing degree `d` (from \( n-1 \) to 0).
  - If the interactor responds with a valid vertex `v` (i.e., `v` is not 0), and `v` is still in the set of remaining vertices, it adds `v` to the path and removes it from the set.
  - The loop ensures that all vertices are eventually added to the path.
  - Finally, it prints the path in the required format and flushes the output buffer.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- **Query Strategy**: The function queries the interactor with decreasing degrees. This is a good strategy because:
  - For \( d = n-1 \), it checks if there is a vertex with the maximum possible degree (i.e., connected to all other vertices).
  - For \( d = n-2 \), it checks for vertices with the second-highest possible degree.
  - This continues until it finds a vertex with a degree of at least 0.
- **Vertex Selection**: The interactor selects the vertex with the minimum degree among those with a degree of at least `d`, and if there are multiple such vertices, it selects the one with the minimum number. This ensures that the function always gets a valid vertex to remove.
- **Path Construction**: By removing vertices in this order, the function ensures that the remaining graph still contains a Hamiltonian path. The path is constructed by appending the selected vertices in the order they are removed.
- **Termination**: The loop terminates when all vertices are added to the path, ensuring that the path includes all vertices exactly once.

### Potential Issues:
- **Query Limit**: The function makes at most \( n \) queries, which is within the allowed limit.
- **Handling Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles the case where the interactor responds with "0 0" (i.e., no vertex with the required degree is found), by continuing to the next query.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions together correctly solve the problem by constructing a Hamiltonian path in the graph using the allowed queries. The strategy of querying with decreasing degrees and removing vertices in a specific order ensures that the path is constructed correctly and efficiently.

Correctness: **True**
