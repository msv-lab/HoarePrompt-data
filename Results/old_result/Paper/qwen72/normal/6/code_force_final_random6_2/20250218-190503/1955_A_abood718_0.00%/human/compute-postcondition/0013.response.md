The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `int(input())`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `int(input())` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The condition for `int(input())` to allow the loop to execute again is that it must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `A` is an integer, `B` is an integer, and `C` is an integer. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, no additional changes are made. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and `A` is even, no additional changes are made. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.**
