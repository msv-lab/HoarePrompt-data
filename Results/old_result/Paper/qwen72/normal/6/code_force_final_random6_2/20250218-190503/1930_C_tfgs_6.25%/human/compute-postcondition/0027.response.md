Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of unique integers (each integer is increased by its index + 1) sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`), and `j` is `adv - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `a` to the list `ans`.
- Since `i` is 0, `ans` now contains the first element of `a`, which is `a[0]`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `counter`, `cnt`, `adv`, `j`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
