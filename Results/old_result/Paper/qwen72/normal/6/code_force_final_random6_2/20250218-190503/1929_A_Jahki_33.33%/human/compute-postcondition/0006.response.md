The value of `order` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `order` depends on the comparison between `a[0]` and `a[1]`. If `a[0]` is greater than or equal to `a[1]`, then `order` was 1 and is now 2. Otherwise, `order` was 0 and is now 1. The states of the other variables (`a`, `num2`, and `i`) are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `num2` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 <= num2 <= 500 and `num2` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `order` is 1 if `a[0]` is less than `a[1]`, otherwise `order` is 2.**
