### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the function `func_1` reads the binary string as a list of integers using `list(map(int, input().split()))`. This is incorrect because the input is a single binary string, not a list of integers separated by spaces.
   - The correct way to read the input should be `s = input().strip()`, which reads the entire line as a string and removes any leading or trailing whitespace.

2. **Logic for Calculating the Minimum Cost**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string by counting the number of 1s (`n`) and adding `n + 1` to the answer (`ans`) whenever a 0 is encountered after at least one 1.
   - This logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for the cyclic nature of the shift operation. The function should consider the entire string as a circular sequence and find the optimal point to start the sorting process.
   - For example, in the string "101011", the correct minimum cost is 5, but the current implementation will not produce this result. The correct approach would be to find the optimal starting point and then calculate the cost based on the number of 1s and 0s in the substring.

3. **Handling Already Sorted Strings**:
   - The function does not handle the case where the string is already sorted. For a string like "0000", the function should output 0, but it will not because it does not check if the string is already sorted.
   - A simple check to see if the string is already sorted (i.e., all 0s come before all 1s) should be added to avoid unnecessary calculations.

4. **Correct Algorithm**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, the algorithm should:
     - Identify the optimal starting point for the cyclic shift.
     - Calculate the cost based on the number of 1s and 0s in the substring.
     - Ensure that the cost is minimized by considering the entire string as a circular sequence.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the issues with input handling and the incorrect logic for calculating the minimum cost, the original assessment is accurate. The program as written does not correctly solve the problem for all test cases.

**Final: False**
