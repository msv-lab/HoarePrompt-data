Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `n` must be at least 2, `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `nums` is a deque of n-2 or n-1 positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9), `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `a` is the first element of the original `nums` deque, `b` is the last element of the original `nums` deque, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `b` > 0 and `a` > 0, and `k` is greater than or equal to 2 * `x`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * x`, `a` is updated to `a - x`, and `b` is updated to `b - x`. If `b` > 0 and `k` is less than 2 * `x`, `k` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b` > 0 and `a` is 0 or less, `ans` is set to 1 and `k` is less than 2 * `x`. If `b` is 0 or less, `ans` is set to 2.***
