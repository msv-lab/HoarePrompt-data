Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` is an integer provided by the user and must be greater than or equal to 2, `y` is an integer provided by the user, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `lst` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, and for each pair of integers (a, b) provided by the user during the loop, `lst[a]` contains `b` as an element, and `lst[b]` contains `a` as an element.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains an integer within the range 2 to 2 × 10^5.
- The value of `t` remains 1.
- The values of `u` and `v` remain integers within the range 1 to `n`.
- The value of `u_1` remains an integer within the range 1 to `n`.
- The value of `x` is an integer provided by the user and must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.
- The value of `y` remains an integer provided by the user.
- The variables `a` and `b` are updated to new pairs of integers provided by the user during each iteration of the loop.
- The `lst` dictionary, which initially has lists as default values, will have each key `a` and `b` from the input pairs appended to each other's lists. After all iterations, `lst[a]` will contain all the `b` values that were paired with `a`, and `lst[b]` will contain all the `a` values that were paired with `b`.
