The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `lst`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `i + 1` and `len(lst)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18) and `n` must be greater than 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and the length of `lst` must be such that `j` is still within the range defined by `i + 1` and `len(lst)`. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, the next value of `j` will be 3. For the loop to continue, `len(lst)` must be greater than 3.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18) and `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 0, `r` is 0, `j` is 3. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `l` is 1 and `over_sum` is updated to `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `sm` is `over_sum - lst[1] + 1`.**
