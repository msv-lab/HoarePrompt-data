Output State: **`N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is a list of N integers such that 2 ≤ `vals[i]` ≤ 20 for all 0 ≤ i < N, `den` is the result of `func_1(vals[0], vals[0])`, `x` is the first element of `vals`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `den` is updated to the result of `func_1(den, x)`.
- Since `den` was initially equal to `vals[0]` and `x` is also the first element of `vals`, `den` is now the result of `func_1(vals[0], vals[0])`.
- The values of `N`, `vals`, and `x` remain unchanged.
