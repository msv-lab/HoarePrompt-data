The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, `i` is 2, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user, and `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i`**
