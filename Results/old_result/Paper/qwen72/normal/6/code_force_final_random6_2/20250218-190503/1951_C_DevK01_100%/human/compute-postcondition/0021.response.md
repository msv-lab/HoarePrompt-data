The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the range defined by `t`. The loop can execute one more time if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be 1 and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`. If `n * m` equals `k`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
