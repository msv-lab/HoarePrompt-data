The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `x` and `y` are not relevant to the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x â‰  y, `i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
