### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Uniform Array**:
   - The program first checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If so, it prints `0` because no operation is needed.
   - This is done by iterating through the array and checking if any element is different from the next one. If all elements are the same, `f` remains `1`, and the program prints `0`.

2. **Handling Single Element Array**:
   - If the array has only one element (`n == 1`), the program also prints `0` because a single element array is already uniform.

3. **Counting Consecutive Elements**:
   - The program then counts the maximum number of consecutive elements from the start (`cn`) and from the end (`ck`) that are the same.
   - This is done by iterating from the start and the end of the array and counting the number of consecutive elements that are equal.

4. **Combining Counts**:
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same (`symb1 == symb2`), the program combines the counts (`cn += ck`).
   - This is because if the first and last elements are the same, the operation can be applied to cover both ends of the array, potentially reducing the cost.

5. **Calculating Minimum Burles**:
   - The program then prints `n - max(cn, ck)`, which represents the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.
   - This is because the operation can be applied to the longest segment of consecutive elements, and the cost is the length of the segment that needs to be changed.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where the array is already uniform.
  - It also correctly handles the case where the array has only one element.
  - The logic for counting consecutive elements from the start and end is correct.
  - Combining the counts when the first and last elements are the same is a valid optimization.
  - The final calculation `n - max(cn, ck)` is correct because it represents the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array uniform.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
