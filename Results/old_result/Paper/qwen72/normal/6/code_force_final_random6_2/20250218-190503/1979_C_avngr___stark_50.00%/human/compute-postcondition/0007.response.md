Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k` is a list of n integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list `k`, `numbers` is a list with at least n elements, `num` is the last element in the list `numbers`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 50.
- The list `k` remains a list of `n` integers, each within the range 2 to 20.
- The variable `hcf` now holds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the integers in the list `k`.
- The list `numbers` must have at least `n` elements, meaning it contains all the elements that were processed by the loop.
- The variable `num` is the last element in the list `numbers` that was processed by the loop.
