Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Removal of Elements**:
   - The program uses `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` to remove elements from the list. This is incorrect because `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` are always 0 and 2, respectively, which do not correspond to the correct indices of the elements to be removed.
   - Instead, the program should remove the first two elements of the list in each iteration.

2. **Inefficient Element Removal**:
   - Removing elements from a list using `remove` is inefficient and can lead to incorrect results because it removes the first occurrence of the specified value, not the element at the specified index.
   - A better approach is to sort the list and then sum the first `n` elements, as the minimum of each pair will always be one of the smallest `n` elements.

3. **Incorrect Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition `if len(lst) != 2` is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. The loop should simply iterate `n` times, as the problem guarantees that there will always be `2n` elements.

### Corrected Program:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()
        ans = sum(lst[:n])
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for ans in ans_f:
        print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting the List**:
   - The list of integers is sorted in ascending order. This ensures that the smallest `n` elements are the first `n` elements in the sorted list.

3. **Calculating the Score**:
   - The program calculates the score by summing the first `n` elements of the sorted list. This is because the minimum of each pair will always be one of the smallest `n` elements.

4. **Storing and Printing Results**:
   - The results are stored in the `ans_f` list and printed at the end.

This corrected program will correctly solve the problem and produce the expected output.
