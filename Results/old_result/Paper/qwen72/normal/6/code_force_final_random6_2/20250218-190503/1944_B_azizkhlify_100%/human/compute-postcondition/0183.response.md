Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `res` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements.
- `i` is the second element of `res`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement will print the value of `i`.
- According to the initial state, `i` is the second element of the list `res`.
- The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function means that the output will be followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Output:
Output: **[i] (where i is the second element of the list res)**

This means that the value of the second element in the list `res` will be printed, followed by a space.
