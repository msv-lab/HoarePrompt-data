Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `index` is increased by `2 * n + 4`, `p` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n - n]` to `data[index - n - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index + n - n - 1]`, `results` now includes the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`.
- The values of `k`, `PB`, and `PS` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
- The value of `index` is increased by `2 * n + 4`, where `n` is now the new value.
- The lists `p` and `a` are updated based on the new value of `n` and the current value of `index`.
- The `results` list now includes the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, where `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are the updated values.
