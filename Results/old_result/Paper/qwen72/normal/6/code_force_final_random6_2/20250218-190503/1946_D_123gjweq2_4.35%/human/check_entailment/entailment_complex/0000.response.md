Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number `k` such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of selected segments of the array is less than or equal to `x`. The provided functions, however, do not correctly implement this logic.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to take an array `arr` and an integer `x`, but it calls `find_max(arr, 31)` and does not use `x` at all. This is incorrect because the value `31` is used as the initial `bit` value, which does not align with the problem's requirement to consider the bitwise OR with `x`.

2. **Function `find_max`**:
   - The function `find_max` is designed to recursively find the maximum number of segments where the XOR of each segment has a specific bit set to 0. However, it does not correctly handle the bitwise OR condition with `x`.
   - The function processes the array to create a new array `new_arr` containing the XOR of elements in `cur_arr` that have a 0 at the `bit` position. This is not aligned with the problem's requirement to find segments such that the bitwise OR of their XOR results is less than or equal to `x`.
   - The function returns the length of `new_arr` or the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)`, but it does not ensure that the bitwise OR condition is met.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic of the program is flawed because it does not correctly implement the required conditions for the segments. The function `find_max` is designed to find segments with specific bit conditions, but it does not consider the bitwise OR with `x` as required by the problem.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
