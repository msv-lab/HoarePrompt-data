Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `word` is the string `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.**

Explanation: The code appends the character at the index `n - 53` from the `alphabet` string and the string `'zz'` to the `word` variable. Since `word` was initially an empty string, it now contains the result of this concatenation. The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
