### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line and the list of ticket prices `M` from the second line.

2. **Constraints:**
   - The function correctly handles the constraints by ensuring that `m` is the minimum of the given `m` and `k` to avoid buying more tickets than needed in a single day.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The function sorts the list of ticket prices `M` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows the function to purchase tickets on the cheapest days first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days to Purchase:**
   - The function calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`, which determines the number of days required to purchase all `k` tickets. This is correct because it ensures that the tickets are bought in the minimum number of days possible.

5. **Selecting the Cheapest Days:**
   - The function selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` to purchase tickets. This is correct because it ensures that the tickets are bought on the cheapest days.

6. **Calculating the Cost:**
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days is exactly `k` (i.e., `n * m == k`), the function calculates the cost as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. This formula accounts for the initial cost of tickets and the additional cost due to the price increase.
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days is not exactly `k`, the function adjusts the cost by popping the last element `w` from `N` and calculating the remaining tickets `mu` to be bought on the last day. The cost is then updated accordingly.

7. **Output:**
   - The function prints the calculated cost for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
- **Price Increase Calculation:**
  - The formula `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is used to calculate the additional cost due to the price increase. However, this formula assumes that the price increase is applied uniformly across all days, which might not be correct. The price increase should be applied to the subsequent days, not all days.
  - The correct approach would be to calculate the price increase for each subsequent day and add it to the total cost.

### Corrected Formula:
- For the case where `n * m == k`, the cost should be calculated as:
  - `cost = m * sum(N) + sum(m * i for i in range(n))`
- For the case where `n * m != k`, the cost should be calculated as:
  - `cost = m * sum(N) + sum(m * i for i in range(n)) + mu * (w + n * m)`

### Conclusion:
The provided program has a logical error in the way it calculates the additional cost due to the price increase. The formula used does not correctly account for the price increase on subsequent days. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
