The loop condition is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`. For the loop to execute the first time, this condition must be true when `i` is 0. Let's break down the state and the condition:

- `x` is an input integer minus 1 and `x` must not be 0.
- `i` is 0.

Substituting `i` with 0 in the loop condition, we get:
```
2 ** (0 + 1) <= x + 1
2 ** 1 <= x + 1
2 <= x + 1
1 <= x
```

Since `x` is an input integer minus 1 and must not be 0, `x` must be at least 1. This means the original input integer must be at least 2, which aligns with the condition `1 <= x`.

Therefore, the loop condition will be satisfied for the first iteration as long as `x` is at least 1. The state of `i` is already 0, which is the correct initial state for the loop to start.

No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`x` is an input integer minus 1 and `x` must not be 0, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a single positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 0**
