The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`. The loop iterates from `n - 2` down to `0` (inclusive) in steps of `-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, so `i` will be `n - 4`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

State: **`t` is the input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `k`, `i` is `n - 4`, `y[i]` is `k`. If `t[i]` is 'R', then `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l + 3`, and `k` is `k * a[l + 2] % m`. Otherwise, if the last character of `t` is 'L', then `q1` is `l - 3`, `q2` is `l`, and `k` is `k * a[l] % m`. If the last character of `t` is not 'L', then `q1` is `l - 2`, `q2` is `l + 1`, and `k` is `k * a[l + 1] % m`.**
