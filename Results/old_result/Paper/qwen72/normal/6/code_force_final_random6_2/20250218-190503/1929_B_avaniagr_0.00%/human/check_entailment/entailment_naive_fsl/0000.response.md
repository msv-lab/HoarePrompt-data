Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 3 \). According to the problem, if \( k = 4n - 3 \), the minimum number of cells that need to be colored is \( 2n - 1 \). However, the program incorrectly returns \( 2n \) in this case.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 9
```
Here, \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 9 \). The correct output should be \( 5 \) (since \( 4n - 3 = 9 \) and \( 2n - 1 = 5 \)), but the program returns \( 6 \). This is incorrect, and thus the program is not correct for all potential cases.
