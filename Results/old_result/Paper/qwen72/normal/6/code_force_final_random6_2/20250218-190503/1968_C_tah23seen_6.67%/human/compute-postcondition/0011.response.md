Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that \(1 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 500\) for all \(1 \leq i < n\), `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 500\), `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `arr[1]`, and the rest of the elements in `ans` are zeros, `i` is 0, and `ans[1]` is equal to `arr[1]`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `arr` remains unchanged, `n` remains an integer between 3 and 500, `ans[0]` is still `arr[0] + 1`, and `ans[1]` has been updated to be equal to `arr[1]`. All other elements in `ans` remain zeros, and `i` is still 0. The loop stops when `ans[1]` is no longer less than `arr[1]`, meaning `ans[1]` has reached the value of `arr[1]`.
