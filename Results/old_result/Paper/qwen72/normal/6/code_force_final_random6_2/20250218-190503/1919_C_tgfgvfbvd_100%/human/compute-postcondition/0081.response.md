Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, and `c` is the number of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.**

The code snippet resets `a` and `b` to `float('inf')`, which means they are now set to positive infinity. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `x`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
