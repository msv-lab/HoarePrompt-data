To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end='')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the transformations applied to the lists `a` and `b`.

### Initial State:
- `x` and `y` are strings of integers, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9.
- The length of `x` and `y` is between 1 and 100 digits.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000.
- `a` and `b` are lists of characters from the input strings `x` and `y`, respectively, with `a` having at least one character.
- For the first half of the characters in `a` and `b` (up to `len(a) // 2 - 1`), each character in `a` is the maximum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`, and each character in `b` is the minimum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`.
- For the second half of the characters in `a` and `b` (from `len(a) // 2` to the end), each character in `a` is the minimum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`, and each character in `b` is the maximum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`.
- `i` is 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the length of `a`**:
   - Let's denote the length of `a` as `n`.
   - The first half of `a` and `b` is from index 0 to `n // 2 - 1`.
   - The second half of `a` and `b` is from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`.

2. **Determine the value of `a[i]`**:
   - Since `i` is 1, we need to check if index 1 falls in the first half or the second half of the list `a`.
   - If `n` is the length of `a`, then `n // 2` is the midpoint.
   - For `i = 1`, if `1 < n // 2`, then `a[1]` is in the first half.
   - If `1 >= n // 2`, then `a[1]` is in the second half.

3. **First Half Transformation**:
   - If `a[1]` is in the first half, then `a[1]` is the maximum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`.
   - For example, if `a[1]` and `b[1]` are '3' and '7' respectively, then `a[1]` will be '7'.

4. **Second Half Transformation**:
   - If `a[1]` is in the second half, then `a[1]` is the minimum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`.
   - For example, if `a[1]` and `b[1]` are '3' and '7' respectively, then `a[1]` will be '3'.

### Conclusion:
- Since `i` is 1, and the first half of the list `a` is defined up to `n // 2 - 1`, we need to check if `1 < n // 2`.
- If `n` is greater than 2, then `1 < n // 2` is true, and `a[1]` is in the first half.
- Therefore, `a[1]` will be the maximum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`.

### Output:
The `print(a[i], end='')` statement will print the character at index 1 of the list `a`, which is the maximum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b` if `n` (the length of `a`) is greater than 2.
Output: **a[1] (where a[1] is the maximum of the corresponding characters from the original a and b)**
