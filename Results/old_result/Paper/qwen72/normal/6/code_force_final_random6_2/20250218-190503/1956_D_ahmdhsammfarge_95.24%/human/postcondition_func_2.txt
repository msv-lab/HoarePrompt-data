The function `func_3` accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`, where `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= r <= l < len(lst)`, `lst` is a list of integers, and `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing operation parameters. The function updates the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` to consist of `n` elements, each equal to `n`, where `n` is `l - r + 1`. Additionally, the function appends several lists to `ops`, including `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `[r + 1, r + 1]`, and potentially `[r + 1, l + 1]` again if the minimum value in the original sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0. The function returns the updated list `lst`. The variables `r`, `l`, and `n` remain unchanged.
