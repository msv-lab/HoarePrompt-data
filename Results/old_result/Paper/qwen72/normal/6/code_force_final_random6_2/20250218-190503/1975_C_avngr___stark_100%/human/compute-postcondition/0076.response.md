Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `n-3`, `_` is less than `t` and incremented by 1, `max` is the maximum value of the middle element in any sorted sub-list of 3 consecutive elements in `a`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: This variable also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: The list `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will have iterated from `0` to `n-3` (inclusive), so the final value of `i` is `n-3`.
- **`_`**: This variable is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs, but since it is not used in the loop body, it remains less than `t`.
- **`max`**: The variable `max` is updated to the maximum value of the middle element in any sorted sub-list of 3 consecutive elements in `a`. This means that `max` will hold the highest value among all the second elements of the sorted sub-lists of length 3 that were considered during the loop execution.
