The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` right-shifted by 1, and it must be non-zero for the loop to execute again.

State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` right-shifted by 1 and must be non-zero, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 1. If `k` was an odd number, `arr` is a list containing `[0]`. Otherwise, `arr` remains an empty list.**
