Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and checks if the list is a palindrome. If the list is a palindrome, it returns 0. If the list is not a palindrome, it returns the length of the longest segment of the list that is not a palindrome, starting from the first mismatching pair of elements. If the mismatch is found at the end of the list, it returns the difference between the last index and the index of the first element in the mismatching segment. The list `arr` remains unchanged. **
