    #State: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is the final value of the left pointer after all iterations, `r` is the final value of the right pointer after all iterations, and `sunks` is the final count of operations performed.
    return sunks
    #The program returns the final count of operations performed, stored in the variable `sunks`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers within specified ranges, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. It performs a series of operations that involve decrementing `k` and adjusting the values in the list `a` based on the values at the left and right pointers (`l` and `r`). The function returns the total count of operations performed, stored in the variable `sunks`. After the function concludes, `k` is reduced by a certain amount, elements in `a` may be modified, and `sunks` contains the number of operations that were successfully completed.
