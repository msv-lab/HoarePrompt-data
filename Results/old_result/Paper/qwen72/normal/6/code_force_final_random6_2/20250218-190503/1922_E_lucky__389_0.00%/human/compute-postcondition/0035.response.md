Postcondition: ***`i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{(i+1)} - 1 \leq x\), and `x` is an input integer minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(i+1)} - 1\). If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is updated to `x - (2^{i+1} - 1)` and `mx` is the maximum of the previous `mx` and `i`.***
