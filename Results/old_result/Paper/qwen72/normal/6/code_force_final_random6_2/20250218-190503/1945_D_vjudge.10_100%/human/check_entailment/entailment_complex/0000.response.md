### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Kirill wants to move to a position not exceeding `m` in the queue.
   - He can bribe the i-th person to move to any position `j` where `j < i`, paying `a[j]` coins to the person at position `j` and `b[k]` coins to each person between `j` and `i-1`.
   - The goal is to minimize the total number of coins Kirill spends.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `numCasos`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the lists `a` and `b`.
   - It initializes `pergunta` to `float('inf')` to represent the minimum cost.
   - The function `func_1` is called with these parameters.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `x` is initialized to 0, which will accumulate the total minimum cost of bribes.
   - The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0` (backwards).
   - For each position `i`:
     - If `i < m`, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of the current `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`.
     - It adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The loop correctly iterates over the positions in reverse order, which is necessary to ensure that Kirill can move to the front of the queue by bribing people in the correct order.
   - The condition `if i < m` ensures that Kirill only considers positions up to `m` for the final position.
   - The update `pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])` correctly calculates the minimum cost to move to a position `i` that is less than `m`.
   - The accumulation `x += min(a[i], b[i])` ensures that the total cost of bribes is minimized by choosing the cheaper option between bribing the person at position `i` or the intermediate positions.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the minimum cost required for Kirill to move to a position not exceeding `m`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position not exceeding `m` in the queue. The function `func_1` correctly calculates and prints the minimum cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
