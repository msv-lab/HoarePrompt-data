Output State: **`test_cases` remains a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The length of `test_cases` is `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `N` is an input integer. `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, and all elements modified such that each element `nums[i]` is now `nums[i] - (nums[0] + nums[1] - nums[0] + ... + nums[i-1] - (nums[i-2] + ... + nums[0]))`. `ls` is the sum of all elements in the modified `nums` list. `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 2`. `nw` is `True`. `cw` is `True`. `nums[i]` is not equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cw = True` does not change the value of `cw` because it was already `True` in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
