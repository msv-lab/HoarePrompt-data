Output State: **`results` contains `t` elements, and each element is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `results` will have `t` elements, where `t` is the number of times the loop was supposed to run. Each element in `results` corresponds to the result of the function `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for that particular iteration of the loop. The values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are determined by the initial state and the changes made in each iteration, but the final state of `results` will be a list of `t` elements, each representing the output of `func_1` for that iteration.
