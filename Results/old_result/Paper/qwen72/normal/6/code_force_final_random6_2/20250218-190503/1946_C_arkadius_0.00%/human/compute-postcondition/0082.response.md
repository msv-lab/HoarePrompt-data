Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `v` is a vertex in `tree` that must have at least one child, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is updated to the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack` and is not empty, `stack` is a list with at least one tuple remaining, but now with one less tuple, and the tuple `(v, True)` has not been appended to `stack` for the current `v`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, the `good_components` value of vertex `v` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components + 1`. Otherwise, the `good_components` value of vertex `v` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and the `remaining_size` of vertex `v` is updated to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.***
