To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the `print` statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string with any number of characters.
   - `neg` is the count of '-' characters in the string `s`.
   - `func_1(s, n)` is defined with parameters `s` and `n` where `1 <= n <= 5000`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement uses a conditional expression (ternary operator) to determine what to print.
   - The condition `n != neg` checks if `n` is not equal to `neg`.
   - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the expression `n - 2 * neg` is evaluated and printed.
   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, the value of `n` is printed directly.

4. **Values of Variables:**
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
   - `neg` is the count of '-' characters in the string `s`.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the output will be `n - 2 * neg`.
   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, the output will be `n`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact values of `n` and `neg` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the given conditions.
   - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the output will be `n - 2 * neg`.
   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, the output will be `n`.

Output: **n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n (where n is an integer between 1 and 5000, and neg is the count of '-' characters in the string s)**
