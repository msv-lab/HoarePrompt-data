Output State: **`total` is 45, `i` is 11, `n` must be greater than or equal to 11, `values` is a list of integers with the specified values, `sum_values` is a list of integers with the specified values, `word` is '11', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 1, `values[10]` is `values[0] + values[1]`, `sum_values[10]` is `values[10] + sum_values[9]`**

Explanation: The code `remainder = int(word[:-1])` does not change the value of `remainder` because `word[:-1]` is '1', and `int('1')` is 1, which is the same as the initial value of `remainder`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
