Postcondition: **`r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` must be a non-empty set, `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?', otherwise `temp` is an empty set, and `c` is either '1' or '?'.**
