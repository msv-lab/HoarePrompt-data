Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where all elements in the array are the same. According to the problem description, if all elements are the same, the beauty of the array should be 0. However, the program incorrectly uses the `func_1` function to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If the array is already sorted, it prints 0, which is incorrect for the case where all elements are the same.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
The expected output is 0, but the program will print 0 because the array is already sorted, which is not a valid check for the case where all elements are the same. The correct approach should be to calculate the beauty of the sorted array directly, as the maximum beauty is always achieved by sorting the array in non-decreasing order.
