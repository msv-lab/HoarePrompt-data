Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp must send to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. Let's break down the logic and check if it correctly handles the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list `p` of best friends.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads `n` and initializes a list `v` of length `n + 1` with zeros. This is to handle 1-based indexing for the friends.
   - It then reads the list `p` and stores it in `v` starting from index 1.
   - The function iterates over each friend `i` from 1 to `n` and checks if `v[v[i]] == i`. This condition checks if the best friend of the best friend of `i` is `i` itself, indicating a mutual best friend relationship.
   - If such a mutual relationship is found, the function prints 2 and returns, as sending invitations to both friends in this mutual relationship will ensure that both come to the party.
   - If no such mutual relationship is found, the function prints 3 and returns. This is based on the assumption that if there are no mutual best friend pairs, the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Mutual Best Friend Pairs**: The program correctly identifies mutual best friend pairs and prints 2 for such cases. This is correct because inviting both friends in a mutual pair will ensure both come to the party.
   - **No Mutual Best Friend Pairs**: The program prints 3 if no mutual pairs are found. This is not always correct. For example, consider the case where `p = [2, 3, 1]`. Here, there are no mutual pairs, but Monocarp can still invite friends 1 and 2, and both will come to the party because friend 1's best friend is 2, and friend 2's best friend is 3, who is also invited. Therefore, the minimum number of invitations required is 2, not 3.

Given this analysis, the program does not correctly handle all cases where there are no mutual best friend pairs. It fails to consider other possible configurations that might allow for fewer than 3 invitations to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

Correctness: **False**
