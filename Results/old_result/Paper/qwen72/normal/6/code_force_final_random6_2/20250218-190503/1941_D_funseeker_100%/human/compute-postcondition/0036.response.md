The only objects in the loop head are the variable `q` and the set `ans`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the set `ans`. If `ans` is non-empty, the loop will execute again for the next value of `q` in `ans`.

At the end of the last iteration, `ans` must be a non-empty set, and `q` is the current value being iterated over from `ans`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must still be non-empty, and `q` will be the next value in `ans`.

State: **`r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` must be a non-empty set, `temp` is an empty set unless `c` is '0' or '?', in which case `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` now contains the value `(q - r) % n` in addition to `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?', `q` is the next value in `ans`**
