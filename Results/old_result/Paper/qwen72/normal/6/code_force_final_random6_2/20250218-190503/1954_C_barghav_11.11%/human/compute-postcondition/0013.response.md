Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of `x` and `y` is between 1 and 100 digits. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, and `b` is a list of characters from the new input string. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus 1, `a[i]` is now equal to the maximum value between the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `b[i]` is now equal to the minimum value between the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `len(a) // 2`, `a[i]` is now equal to the minimum value between the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `b[i]` is now equal to the maximum value between the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**
