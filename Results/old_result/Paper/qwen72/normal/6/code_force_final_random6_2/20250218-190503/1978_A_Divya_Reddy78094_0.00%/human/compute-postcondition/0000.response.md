Output State: **The function should take two parameters: `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of pages in each book for a test case. `t` is an input integer.**
