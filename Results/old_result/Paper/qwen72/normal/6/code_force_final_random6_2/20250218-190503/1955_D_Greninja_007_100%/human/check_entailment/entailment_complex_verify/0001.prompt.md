You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It returns the number of times the sum of the minimum frequencies of the common elements between any contiguous subsequence of length `m` in list `a` and the list `b` is greater than or equal to `k`. The function does not modify the input lists `a` and `b`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the elements of arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Counter Initialization:**
   - The program uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of elements in `b` and the first subsegment of `a` of length `m`.
   - `cb` is initialized with the counts of elements in `b`.
   - `ca` is initialized with the counts of elements in the first subsegment of `a`.

3. **Initial Check:**
   - The program calculates the initial number of matching elements between the first subsegment of `a` and `b` using the intersection of the two counters.
   - If the number of matching elements `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsequent subsegment of `a` of length `m`.
   - For each new element `a[r]` added to the window:
     - It checks if the count of `a[r]` in `ca` is less than its count in `cb`. If so, it increments `sm` because this new element can potentially increase the number of matches.
     - It updates the count of `a[r]` in `ca`.
   - For each element `a[r - m]` removed from the window:
     - It checks if the count of `a[r - m]` in `ca` is less than or equal to its count in `cb`. If so, it decrements `sm` because this element is no longer contributing to the matches.
     - It updates the count of `a[r - m]` in `ca`.
   - After updating the window, it checks if the number of matching elements `sm` is still greater than or equal to `k`. If so, it increments `ans`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of good subsegments for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The program correctly initializes the counters and performs the initial check.
- The sliding window approach is appropriate for this problem, as it efficiently updates the counts of elements in the current subsegment of `a`.
- The logic for updating `sm` when adding and removing elements from the window is correct. It ensures that the number of matching elements is accurately tracked.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where `a[r]` or `a[r - m]` are not in `cb` or `ca` before updating. However, the `Counter` class in Python handles this gracefully by defaulting to 0 for non-existent keys, so this is not an issue.
- The program correctly uses the intersection of counters to count matching elements.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be logically correct and should work as intended for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
