The function `func_2` accepts two integers `r` and `l` and a list `ops`. It ensures that `r` and `l` are within the range 1 to n. If `r` is equal to `l`, it appends the pair `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the list `ops` and returns. If `r` is not equal to `l`, it recursively calls itself twice with `l` decremented by 1, and appends the pair `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` between the recursive calls. The function does not return any value, but modifies the `ops` list. After the function concludes, `ops` contains multiple pairs `[r + 1, l + 1]` for each recursive call where `r` is not equal to `l`.
