Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is the first integer read from the input line, and `k` is the second integer read from the input line. If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`, and the relationship between `n + 2` and `k * 2` is such that either `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2` or `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.***
