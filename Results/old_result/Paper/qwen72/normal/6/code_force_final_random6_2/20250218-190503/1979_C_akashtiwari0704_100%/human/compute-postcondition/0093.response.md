Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is the sum of all updated `a[i]` values, `T` is `t`, if `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`. Otherwise, `sumo` is less than `prod`, and `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space. `a` is a list of integers input by the user, and `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`.**
