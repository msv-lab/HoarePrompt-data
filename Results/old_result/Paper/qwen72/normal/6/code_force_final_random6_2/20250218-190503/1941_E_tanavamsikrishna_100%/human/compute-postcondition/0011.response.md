Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - The loop has completed all iterations.
   - `i` is `len(costs) - k`.
   - `total_costs` is a list containing the sums of every contiguous subsequence of length `k` in `costs`.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `costs` is a list of integers.
   - `k` is an integer representing the length of the contiguous subsequences.
   - `total_costs` is a list that has been populated with the sums of every contiguous subsequence of length `k` in `costs`.

3. **What the Code Does**:
   - The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the minimum value from the list `total_costs`.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - Since `total_costs` contains the sums of every contiguous subsequence of length `k` in `costs`, the `min(total_costs)` will be the smallest sum among these subsequences.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The output will be the minimum sum of any contiguous subsequence of length `k` in the `costs` list.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where min(total_costs) is the minimum sum of any contiguous subsequence of length k in the costs list)**
