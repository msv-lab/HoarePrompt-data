The function `func_1` does not take any parameters. However, it reads a binary string `s` from the input, where `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s). The function initializes two variables, `n` and `ans`, to 0. After processing the input, the function returns the value of `ans`.

Functionality: **The function reads a binary string `s` from the input, processes it, and returns an integer `ans`.**
