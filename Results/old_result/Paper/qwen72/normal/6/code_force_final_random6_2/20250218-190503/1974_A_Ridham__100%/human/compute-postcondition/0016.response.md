Output State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `extra_space` is assigned the value of `space_x - remaining_cells`.
- The initial state specifies that `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, so `extra_space` will be a positive integer.
- All other variables and their values or expressions remain unchanged.
