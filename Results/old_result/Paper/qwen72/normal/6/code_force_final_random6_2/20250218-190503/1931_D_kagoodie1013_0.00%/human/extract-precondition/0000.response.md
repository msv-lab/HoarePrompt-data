Precondition: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n, x, y, and a list a. n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, x and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
