Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers, where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 200,000. It prints the first integer `i` that either has a frequency of 0 in `arr` or is the second unique integer in `arr` that appears exactly once. If no such integer is found, the function completes without printing anything. The function does not return any value. **
