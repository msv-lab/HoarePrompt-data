Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input.
   - `test` must be greater than 2.
   - `t` is 2.
   - If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the condition holds.
   - If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the condition also holds.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('Alice')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The condition described in the initial state is that the sum of `a` and `b` must be either even or odd.
   - Since any integer sum is either even or odd, the condition will always be true.
   - Therefore, the `print('Alice')` statement will always execute.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the string 'Alice'.

Output: **Alice**
