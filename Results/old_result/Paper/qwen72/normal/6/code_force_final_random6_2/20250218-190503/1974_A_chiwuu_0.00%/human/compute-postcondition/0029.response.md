Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `a` is the integer value of the original string `a`; `b` is now an integer representing the original value of `b`; `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`.**

The value of `t` is updated to be the result of `b * 2` divided by 5 (using integer division) plus 1. The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
