You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` should take two parameters: `t` (an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `arrays` where each inner list represents a beautiful array `a` of integers. Each `a` has a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and contains integers `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

    n = int(input())

    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):

    #State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arrays` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a beautiful array `a` of integers, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is False.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
        
    #State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arrays` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a beautiful array `a` of integers, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is False, `ans` is the minimum of the counts of consecutive elements equal to `val` before encountering a different element, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `val` at the end of the loop.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of arr before encountering a different element, updated to be the minimum of the previous ans and cnt)

If `flag` is True (all elements in `arr` are the same), `ans` remains the same as the count of consecutive elements equal to `val`. If `flag` is False (not all elements in `arr` are the same), `ans` is the minimum of the counts of consecutive elements equal to `val` before encountering a different element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the input. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of `arr` before encountering a different element and prints this minimum count. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful.
   - A beautiful array is one where we can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we are given an array \(a\) and need to output the minimum number of elements to remove or -1 if it is impossible.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using the function `func_1`.
   - In `func_1`, it first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints -1 because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - If the array is not all the same, it initializes `ans` to infinity and iterates through the array to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element. This is done to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern of the beautiful array.

4. **Logic Check**:
   - The logic to check if all elements are the same is correct. If all elements are the same, the array is beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - The logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element is the answer. This does not necessarily break the beautiful property of the array.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To make an array non-beautiful, we need to break the condition where \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\) and \(a_i\) can be replaced with \(a_{i-1}\).
   - One way to do this is to find the longest subarray where all elements are the same and remove the minimum number of elements to break this subarray.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle this. It only considers the first element and its consecutive occurrences, which is not sufficient.

6. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the array `[2, 2, 2]`, the program correctly outputs -1 because all elements are the same.
   - For the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program outputs 1, which is correct because removing the last element makes the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]` non-beautiful.
   - For the array `[1]`, the program correctly outputs -1 because a single-element array is trivially beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful.
   - For the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program outputs 3, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 1 because removing the middle 5 makes the array `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` non-beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the general case of finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only works for specific cases and fails in others.
