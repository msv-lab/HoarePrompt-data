Output State: **`_` is 1, `k` and `a` are integers, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is 2 + 2 // (k - 1), `i` is 1, the user input must be greater than `x`, `k` is the first integer from user input, `x` is the second integer from user input, `a` is the third integer from user input.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value.
- Initially, `s` is `1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `2 + 1 // (k - 1)`.
- After the execution of the code, `s` becomes `2 + 1 // (k - 1) + (2 + 1 // (k - 1)) // (k - 1) + 1`.
- Simplifying the expression, `s` is now `2 + 2 // (k - 1)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
