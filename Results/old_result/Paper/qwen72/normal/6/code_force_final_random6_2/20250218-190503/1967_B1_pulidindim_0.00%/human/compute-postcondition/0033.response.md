Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is equal to `n + Î£((n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1) for k in range(2, m + 1)`, `countmins` is `m`, and `g` is equal to `n / m - (m - 1)`. If `g` < `countmins`, the loop breaks.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user through `input()`.
- The other variables (`t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The initial conditions for `t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g` are still valid.
- The loop condition (`if g < countmins, the loop breaks`) remains unchanged.
