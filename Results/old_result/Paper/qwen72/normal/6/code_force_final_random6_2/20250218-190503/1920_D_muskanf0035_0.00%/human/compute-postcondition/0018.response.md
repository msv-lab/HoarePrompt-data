To determine what will be printed by the `print(*result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `q` are positive integers provided by user input.
   - `t` must be greater than 2 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, it is mentioned as a precondition).
   - `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each sublist contains two integers `b` and `x` as provided by user input.
   - `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers.
   - `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.
   - `_` is 2 (though `_` is not used in the provided code snippet, it is mentioned as a precondition).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(*result)
   ```

3. **Understanding the Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is not provided, but based on the initial state, it is expected to process the `operations` and `queries` lists and return a value or list of values stored in `result`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print(*result)` statement will unpack the `result` and print its elements separated by spaces.
   - Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the structure and content of `result`.

Given the initial state and the structure of the problem, the output will depend on the values returned by `func_1`. However, we can describe the output in a general form:

Output: **[elements of result] (where result is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`)**

This means that the `print` statement will output the elements of the `result` list, separated by spaces. The exact values of these elements will depend on the specific implementation of `func_1` and the inputs provided by the user.
