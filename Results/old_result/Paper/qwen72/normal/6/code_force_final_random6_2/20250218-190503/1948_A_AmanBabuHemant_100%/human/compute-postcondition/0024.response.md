Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 48, inclusive, and is greater than 0. If `n` is odd, `n` is the input integer and `s` is not defined. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is `n // 2 * 3`. If `n // 2 * 3` is less than 200, the length of `s` is less than 200. Otherwise, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200.**
