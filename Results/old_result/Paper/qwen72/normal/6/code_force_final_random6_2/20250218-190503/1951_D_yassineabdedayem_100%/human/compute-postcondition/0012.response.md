Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `_` is a placeholder variable (its value is not relevant to the problem).
   - `n` is the first integer read from the input line.
   - `k` is the second integer read from the input line.
   - `n` is not equal to `k`.
   - The current value of `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer `1`.
   - The values of `n` and `k` are not directly used in the `print` statement, but they are part of the precondition.
   - The precondition states that `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, which is a condition that must be true for the code to execute. However, this condition does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the `print` statement is `print(1)`, it will always print the integer `1` regardless of the values of `n` and `k` as long as the precondition is satisfied.

Output: **1**
