Postcondition: **`N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is a list of N integers such that 2 ≤ `vals[i]` ≤ 20 for all 0 ≤ i < N, `den` is the result of applying `func_1` to all elements of `vals` sequentially, starting with `vals[0]` as the initial value, `vprod` is a list of N integers where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals` (using integer division), `den` is now `den` minus the sum of `vprod`, and the current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.**
