Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 1, and `c` is 0. If `l[1]` ≤ `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[1]`, and if `a` > `b`, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `l[1]` > `a`, then `c` is 1, `a` is updated to `l[1]`, and if `a` > `b`, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
