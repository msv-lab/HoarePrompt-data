Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (4 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `sm` is the sum of the first element of `lst` plus the sum of elements from the fourth element to the end of `lst` plus 9, if `sm` > `over_sum` then `over_sum` is equal to `sm`, and `r` and `l` are both [1, 2], `r` is [1, 3], `l` is [1, 3].**

Explanation:
- The code `r, l = [i, j]` assigns the list `[i, j]` to both `r` and `l`.
- Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, the list `[1, 3]` is assigned to both `r` and `l`.
- All other variables (`lst`, `i`, `j`, `sm`, `over_sum`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state conditions are still valid, with the additional update to `r` and `l`.
