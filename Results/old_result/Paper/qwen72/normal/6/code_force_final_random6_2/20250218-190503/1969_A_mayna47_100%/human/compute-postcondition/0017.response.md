Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user.
   - If for any `i` from 1 to `n`, `v[v[i]]` is equal to `i`, the program prints 2 and returns.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(3)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print(3)` statement is a simple print statement that prints the integer 3.
   - The initial state describes a condition where the program might print 2 and return if a specific condition is met. However, this condition is not relevant to the `print(3)` statement because the `print(3)` statement is not conditional and will always execute.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print(3)` statement will always print the integer 3, regardless of the values of `n`, `i`, or the list `v`.

Output: **3**
