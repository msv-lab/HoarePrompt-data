### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input correctly, storing the list of integers in `lst` and initializing an empty list `ops` to store the operations.

2. **Finding the Optimal Subarray:**
   - `func_1` is designed to find the subarray `[l, r]` that, when replaced with its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array. The function iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential new sum `sm` by replacing the subarray with its MEX. The MEX is implicitly calculated as `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is the maximum possible MEX for a subarray of length `(j - i + 1)`.
   - However, the function returns `r` and `l` as indices where `r` is the start index and `l` is the end index, which is incorrect. The indices should be `l` and `r` to match the problem's requirement that `1 <= l <= r <= n`.

3. **Applying the Operation:**
   - `func_3` is supposed to apply the operation to the subarray `[r, l]` and update the `ops` list with the operation parameters.
   - The function appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` multiple times, which is unnecessary and incorrect. It should only append the operation once.
   - The function also updates the subarray `lst[r:l + 1]` to `[n for _ in range(n)]`, where `n` is the length of the subarray. This is correct because the MEX of a subarray of length `n` is `n` if all integers from `0` to `n-1` are present in the subarray.

4. **Handling Zeros:**
   - After the main loop, the program attempts to replace all zeros in the array with ones. This is a valid approach to maximize the sum, but it should be done more efficiently.
   - The use of `try` and `except ValueError` is appropriate to handle the case where there are no zeros in the array.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the sum of the final array and the number of operations.
   - It also prints the operations in the correct format.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Index Return in `func_1`:** The function `func_1` returns `r` and `l` in the wrong order. It should return `l` and `r` to match the problem's requirement.
- **Redundant Operations in `func_3`:** The function `func_3` appends the same operation multiple times, which is unnecessary and incorrect. It should only append the operation once.

### Correctness:
- **False**: The program has issues with the order of indices returned by `func_1` and redundant operations in `func_3`. These issues can lead to incorrect results or excessive operations.

### Correctness: **False**
