Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings from user input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to `a`, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is 0.** 

The code snippet `suma = 0` resets the value of `suma` to 0, overriding any previous value that `suma` might have had. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
