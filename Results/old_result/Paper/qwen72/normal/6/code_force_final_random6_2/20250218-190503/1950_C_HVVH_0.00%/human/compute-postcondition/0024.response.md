Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `h` is updated to `h - 12` and is an integer, `m` is an integer representing the minute from the input string in the format 'HH:MM', `day` is 'PM'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1.
- The value of `h` is still updated to `h - 12` and remains an integer.
- The value of `m` is still an integer representing the minute from the input string in the format 'HH:MM'.
- The value of `day` is now explicitly set to 'PM', regardless of its previous value.
