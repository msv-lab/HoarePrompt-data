You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: After all iterations, `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user for each iteration, `t` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `t - 1`, `count` is `m + 1` for each iteration, `ans` is the sum of `n` and the series of values added in each iteration where `g` is `n / count - (count - 1)`, `countmins` is `m - 1` for each iteration, and `g` is the final value of `n / m - (m - 1)` for each iteration. If `g` is less than `countmins` for any iteration, the loop breaks for that iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function implicitly uses or requires two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) and returns a value based on some computation involving these integers.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
