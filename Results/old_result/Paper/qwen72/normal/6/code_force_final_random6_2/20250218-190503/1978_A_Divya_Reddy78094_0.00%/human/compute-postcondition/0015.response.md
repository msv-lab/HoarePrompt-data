Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, sorted in descending order.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(nums[0] + nums[1])
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `nums` is a list of integers that is sorted in descending order. This means the largest element is at index 0, and the second largest element is at index 1.
   - The `print` statement will add the first element (`nums[0]`) and the second element (`nums[1]`) of the list `nums` and print the result.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `nums` is sorted in descending order, `nums[0]` is the largest integer in the list, and `nums[1]` is the second largest integer in the list.
   - The sum of these two largest integers will be printed.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be the sum of the two largest integers in the list `nums`.

Output: **nums[0] + nums[1] (where nums[0] is the largest integer in the list and nums[1] is the second largest integer in the list)**
