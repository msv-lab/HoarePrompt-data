### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.
   - It then calls `func_1(arr)` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1(arr)`:**
   - The function initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It enters a loop that continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the elements at `i` and `j` are equal. If they are, it moves both pointers inward (`i += 1` and `j -= 1`). This effectively checks if the array is already a palindrome or if it can be made a palindrome by only changing the middle element (if the length is odd).
   - If the elements at `i` and `j` are not equal, the loop breaks. This means the array is not a palindrome and needs to be modified.

3. **Post-Loop Conditions:**
   - If `i` is greater than `j`, it means the array is already a palindrome, and no operation is needed. The function returns `0`.
   - If the loop breaks, `i` and `j` are at positions where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`.

4. **Handling Consecutive Duplicates:**
   - The function then enters another loop to skip over consecutive duplicates starting from `i`. This is to ensure that the minimum number of elements to change is considered.
   - If `j` is not the last index of the array, the function returns the number of elements from `i` to `j` inclusive, which is `j - i + 1`.

5. **Final Return:**
   - If `j` is the last index of the array, the function returns the difference `j - i`.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Palindrome Check:**
  - The initial loop correctly checks if the array is a palindrome or can be made a palindrome by only changing the middle element. If it is, the function correctly returns `0`.

- **Consecutive Duplicates:**
  - The second loop correctly skips over consecutive duplicates starting from `i`. This ensures that the minimum number of elements to change is considered.

- **Return Values:**
  - The function returns the correct number of burles needed to make the array elements equal. If `j` is not the last index, it returns `j - i + 1`, which is the number of elements to change. If `j` is the last index, it returns `j - i`, which is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal. It handles all edge cases and test cases as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
