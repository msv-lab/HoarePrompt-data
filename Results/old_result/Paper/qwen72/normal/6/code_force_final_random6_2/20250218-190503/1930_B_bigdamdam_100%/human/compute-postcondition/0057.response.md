The code snippet `p[i] = ind` assigns the value of `ind` to the element at index `i` in the list `p`. Given that `i` is 0, the first element of `p` (i.e., `p[0]`) is set to the value of `ind`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `p[0]` is `ind`.**
