### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the input as a list of integers using `list(map(int, input().split()))`. This is incorrect because the problem description specifies that the input is a binary string, not a list of integers.
   - The correct way to read the input in `func_1` should be `s = input().strip()`, which reads the entire line as a string and removes any leading or trailing whitespace.

2. **Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes `n` and `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates over the string `s` and increments `n` whenever it encounters a '1'.
   - If it encounters a '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

   This logic is flawed because:
   - It does not correctly handle the case where the string is already sorted.
   - It does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the string. For example, for the input "101011", the function will not produce the correct output of 5.

3. **Correct Logic:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to make the string sorted in non-descending order.
   - One efficient way to do this is to find the position of the first '1' that is followed by a '0' and then calculate the cost based on the number of such transitions and the length of the string.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input "10":
     - The correct output is 2, which is the length of the string.
     - The function `func_1` will output 2, which is correct in this case.
   - For the input "0000":
     - The correct output is 0, as the string is already sorted.
     - The function `func_1` will output 0, which is correct in this case.
   - For the input "11000":
     - The correct output is 9, which is the sum of the lengths of the substrings [1, 3], [2, 4], and [3, 5].
     - The function `func_1` will output 9, which is correct in this case.
   - For the input "101011":
     - The correct output is 5, which is the minimum cost to sort the string.
     - The function `func_1` will output 7, which is incorrect.
   - For the input "01101001":
     - The correct output is 11, which is the minimum cost to sort the string.
     - The function `func_1` will output 13, which is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the input correctly and does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the string. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
