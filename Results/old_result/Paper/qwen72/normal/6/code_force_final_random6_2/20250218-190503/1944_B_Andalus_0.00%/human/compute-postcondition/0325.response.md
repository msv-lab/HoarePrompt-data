To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the `rgt` list.
   - `rdb` contains elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, and must have at least one element.
   - `sz` is 0.
   - The program has already printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice, separated by spaces.
   - Elements from `sng` have been printed until `sz` reaches `k` or `sng` is exhausted.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - Otherwise, the program continues to print elements from `sng` until `sz` reaches `k` or `sng` is exhausted.
   - The current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

2. **Context:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is inside a loop or conditional block that is still active because `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `elem` is the current element being processed in the loop.
   - Since `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, the program is still in the process of printing elements to reach the total count of `k`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space.

Given the initial state and the context, the output will be the value of `elem` printed twice, followed by a space. Since `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only describe it based on the context provided.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the current element being processed in the loop)**
