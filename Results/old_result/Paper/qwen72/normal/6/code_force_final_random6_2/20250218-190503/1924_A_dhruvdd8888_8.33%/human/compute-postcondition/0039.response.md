Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input with constraints:
     - 1 ≤ n ≤ 26
     - 1 ≤ k ≤ 26
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5 (though it's not used in the print statement).
   - `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
   - `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.
   - `win` is an empty set.
   - `ans` is a list containing the characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach a size of `k` and then cleared `win`.
   - `ps` is the number of times `win` reached a size of `k` and was cleared, and `ps` is less than `n`.
   - If `i` is not in `win`, `i` is the next element in `us` and `i` is not in `win`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `ans` is a list of characters that caused `win` to reach a size of `k` and then cleared `win`.
   - `i` is the next element in `us` that is not in `win`.
   - The print statement concatenates:
     - `''.join(ans)`: This joins all the characters in the list `ans` into a single string.
     - `i`: This is the next character in `us` that is not in `win`.
     - `'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)`: This creates a string of `a` characters with a length of `n - len(ans) - 1`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The length of `ans` is the number of times `win` reached a size of `k` and was cleared.
   - `i` is the next character in `us` that is not in `win`.
   - The remaining characters are `a` to make the total length of the printed string equal to `n`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The string printed will be the concatenation of the characters in `ans`, the next character `i` from `us` that is not in `win`, and the necessary number of `a` characters to reach a total length of `n`.

Output: **`''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)` (where `ans` is the list of characters that caused `win` to reach a size of `k` and then cleared `win`, `i` is the next character in `us` that is not in `win`, and `n` is the user-provided integer)**

This output is a string that combines the characters in `ans`, the next character `i` from `us` that is not in `win`, and the necessary number of `a` characters to reach a total length of `n`.
