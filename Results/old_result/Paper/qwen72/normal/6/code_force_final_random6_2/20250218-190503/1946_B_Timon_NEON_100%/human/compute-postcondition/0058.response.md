Postcondition: **`i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list if the last element of `arr` is negative, otherwise it is `[sum of all non-negative elements from the last segment, index of the last non-negative element]`, `max_segment` is `[sum of the maximum segment of non-negative elements, starting index of the maximum segment]`, `segments_variants` is a list of lists that must have at least one element, `segment` is the first element in `segments_variants`, `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`, and the current value of `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]` and the length of `segment` is not 1.**
