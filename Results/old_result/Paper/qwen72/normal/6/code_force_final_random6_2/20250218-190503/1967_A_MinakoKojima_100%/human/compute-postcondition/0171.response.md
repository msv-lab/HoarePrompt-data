Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first input integer greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer greater than 0 minus `dif` times 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `ans` is now equal to the first element of `a` plus the difference between the second and third elements of `a`, `ans_list` is a list that contains the updated value of `ans` as its last element, `i` is 1, `dif` is the difference between the second and third elements of `a`, and `res` is decreased by 1.**
