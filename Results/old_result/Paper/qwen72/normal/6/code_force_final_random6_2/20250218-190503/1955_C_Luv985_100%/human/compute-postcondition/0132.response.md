Postcondition: ***`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` or `n - 3`, and `k` must be greater than 0. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - mi`, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`. If `a[r]` is 0 after the update, `ans` is increased by 1. If `a[r]` is not 0, `r` remains `n - 1` or `n - 2` or `n - 3`. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is 0 if `k` is even, or 1 if `k` is odd. If `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
