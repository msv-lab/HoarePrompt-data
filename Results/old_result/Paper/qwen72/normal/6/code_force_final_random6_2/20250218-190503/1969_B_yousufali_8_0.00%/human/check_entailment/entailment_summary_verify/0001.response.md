### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The cost of each operation is the length of the chosen substring.
   - We need to minimize the total cost of all operations.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The function reads a binary string and converts it into a list of integers.
     - It initializes two variables: `n` to count the number of 1s and `ans` to store the total cost.
     - It iterates through the string:
       - If the current character is `1`, it increments `n`.
       - If the current character is `0` and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
     - Finally, it prints `ans`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - **Input Handling in `func_1`:**
     - The function `func_1` reads the input using `input().split()`, which is incorrect for a binary string. The input should be read as a single string, not split into a list.
     - The correct way to read a binary string is `s = input().strip()`.
   - **Conversion to List of Integers:**
     - The function converts the string to a list of integers using `list(map(int, s))`. This is correct, but it should be `list(map(int, s))` or `list(map(int, list(s)))` if `s` is a string.
   - **Logic for Calculating Cost:**
     - The logic for calculating the cost is flawed. The cost should be calculated based on the number of 1s that need to be moved to the left of 0s, but the current implementation does not correctly handle this.
     - The correct approach is to find the number of transitions from `1` to `0` and calculate the cost based on these transitions.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - For a binary string to be sorted in non-descending order, all `1`s should be to the right of all `0`s.
   - The minimum cost to achieve this is the length of the longest contiguous segment of `1`s that needs to be moved to the right of all `0`s.
   - This can be calculated by finding the number of transitions from `1` to `0` and then summing the lengths of the substrings that need to be shifted.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Input Handling:**
  - The function `func_1` reads input using `input().split()`, which is incorrect. It should read the input as a single string using `input().strip()`.
  - The current implementation will fail if the input string contains spaces or is split into multiple parts.

- **Conversion to List of Integers:**
  - The conversion `list(map(int, input().split()))` is incorrect because `input().split()` will split the string into parts, which is not what we want for a binary string.
  - The correct conversion should be `list(map(int, input().strip()))` or `list(map(int, list(input().strip())))`.

- **Logic for Calculating Cost:**
  - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It adds `n + 1` to `ans` whenever it encounters a `0` and `n` is not zero.
  - This logic does not correctly account for the cost of moving `1`s to the right of `0`s. It should instead find the number of transitions from `1` to `0` and calculate the cost based on these transitions.

### Corrected Logic:
- To correctly calculate the minimum cost, we need to:
  - Count the number of transitions from `1` to `0`.
  - For each transition, the cost is the length of the substring from the start of the segment of `1`s to the end of the segment of `0`s.
  - The total cost is the sum of these lengths.

### Example:
- For the string `101011`:
  - There are two transitions from `1` to `0` at positions 1 and 3.
  - The cost for the first transition is 2 (substring `10`).
  - The cost for the second transition is 3 (substring `101`).
  - The total cost is 2 + 3 = 5.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the issues in input handling and the logic for calculating the cost. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
