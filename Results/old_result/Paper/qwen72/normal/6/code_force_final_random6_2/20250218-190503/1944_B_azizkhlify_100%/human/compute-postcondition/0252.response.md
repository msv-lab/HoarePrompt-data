To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `res` is an empty list.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in the range `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in the range `n` to `2 * n - 1`) is incremented by 1.
- `ul`, `ur`, and `re` are initially 0.
- If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, then `ul` is set to 0, `ur` is set to 0, `re` is set to 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ul`, `ur`, and `re` remain 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2.
- The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (since `end=' '` is specified).

### Values:
- `a[i]` is the element at index 2 of the list `a`.

### Output:
Since `i` is 2, the `print` statement will print the value of `a[2]` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **a[2] a[2] (where a[2] is the third element of the list `a`)**
