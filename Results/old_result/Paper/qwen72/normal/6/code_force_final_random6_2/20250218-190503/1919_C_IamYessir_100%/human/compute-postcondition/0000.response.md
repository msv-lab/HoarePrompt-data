The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is controlled by the `range` function. The `range` function depends on the input provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. This means that the input to the `range` function should be `t` for the loop to execute `t` times.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input to the `range` function is `t` and that `_` is 0 (the starting point for the loop counter).

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `int(input())` must be `t`**
