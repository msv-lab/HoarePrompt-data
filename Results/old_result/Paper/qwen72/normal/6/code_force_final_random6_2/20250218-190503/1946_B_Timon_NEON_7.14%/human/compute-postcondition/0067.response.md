Output State: **`arr` remains a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr)`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_segment` contains the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and the index of the last element of this subarray, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the sum of the current contiguous subarray and the index of the last element of this subarray, `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a contiguous subarray and the indices of the first and last elements of this subarray, and now includes an additional list with the elements of `max_segment` plus the index `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` remains -1, `total_max_segment` is updated to the segment in `segments_variants` with the maximum sum, or remains `[-1]` if all sums in `segments_variants` are less than or equal to -1.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the state of the variables is as follows:
- `arr` is still a list of integers with each element within the range -10^9 to 10^9.
- `i` is still `len(arr) - 1`.
- `max_segment` still contains the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and the index of the last element of this subarray.
- `new_segment` is still either an empty list or a list containing the sum of the current contiguous subarray and the index of the last element of this subarray.
- `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a contiguous subarray and the indices of the first and last elements of this subarray, and includes an additional list with the elements of `max_segment` plus the index `len(arr) - 1`.
- `max_sum` remains -1, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `total_max_segment` is updated to the segment in `segments_variants` that has the maximum sum. If all sums in `segments_variants` are less than or equal to -1, `total_max_segment` remains `[-1]`.
