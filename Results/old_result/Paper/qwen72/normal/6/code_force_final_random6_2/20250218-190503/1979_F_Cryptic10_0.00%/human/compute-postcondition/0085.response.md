Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is 0, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(0)`. If `v` is not 0 and is in the `remaining_vertices` list, `v` is appended to the `path` list and removed from the `remaining_vertices` list, with `v` as the last element of `path` and `v` no longer in `remaining_vertices`. If `v` is 0 or was not in the `remaining_vertices` list, the states of `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `d` will be 0, and the loop will have processed the values of `v` and `u` returned by `func_1(d)` for each `d` from `n - 1` down to 0. If at any point `v` is not 0 and is in the `remaining_vertices` set, `v` will be added to the `path` list and removed from the `remaining_vertices` set, and the loop will break. If no such `v` is found, the `path` and `remaining_vertices` will remain unchanged from their initial states.
