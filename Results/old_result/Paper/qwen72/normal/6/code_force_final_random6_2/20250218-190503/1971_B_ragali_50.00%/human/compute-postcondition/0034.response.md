The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on whether there are more characters in `s` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the next character in `s`, and `s` must have at least one more character for the loop to execute again.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be the next character in `s` (i.e., the character following the one it was in the previous iteration), and `s` must have at least one more character remaining.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is the next character in `s`, `s` is the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed and must have at least one more character, `a` is a set containing 0 and the previous `i`**
