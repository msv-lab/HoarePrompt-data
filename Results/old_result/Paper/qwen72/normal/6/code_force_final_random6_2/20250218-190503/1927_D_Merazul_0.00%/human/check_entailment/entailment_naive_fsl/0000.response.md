Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the program is not designed to handle the input and output format as specified in the problem description. The program is supposed to read an array and multiple queries, and for each query, it should find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(a_i \ne a_j\) within the specified range. However, the provided program does not read the array and queries in the correct format, and it does not perform the required operations to find the indices. Instead, it seems to be performing some unrelated operations and prints a string "YNEOS" based on some conditions, which is not what the problem description requires.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```
The expected output should be:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```
However, the provided program will not produce this output. It will likely produce an incorrect or unexpected result because it does not correctly parse the input or perform the required logic to find the indices.
