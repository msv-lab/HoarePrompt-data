Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `n` must be at least 2, `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15) and `k` must be non-zero, `nums` is a deque of `n-2` or `n-3` positive integers (1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9) and `len(nums)` must be at least 2, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `a` is the first element of the original `nums` deque, `b` is the last element of the original `nums` deque, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, then `a` is updated to `a - x`, `b` is updated to `b - x`, `x` is updated to the new minimum of `a` and `b`, and `k` is updated to `k - 2 * x`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums.appendleft(a)` adds the value of `a` to the left side of the deque `nums`.
- The length of `nums` is increased by 1, so `nums` now has `n-2` or `n-3` elements.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `ans`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The condition for updating `a`, `b`, `x`, and `k` is still in effect and will be checked in subsequent steps.
