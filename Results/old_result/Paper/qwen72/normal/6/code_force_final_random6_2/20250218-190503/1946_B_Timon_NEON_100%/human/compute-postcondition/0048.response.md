Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is updated to `[arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arr[1]` is not negative, or remains as `[arr[0] + arr[2], 0]` if `arr[0]` is less than 0 or `arr[1]` is negative. `segments_variants` is a list containing either `[0, 0, -1]` or `[arr[1], 1, 0]` depending on the values of `max_segment` and `new_segment`. If `arr[2]` is negative, `new_segment` is an empty list. If `arr[2]` is non-negative, `new_segment[0]` is updated to `new_segment[0] + arr[2]`.***
