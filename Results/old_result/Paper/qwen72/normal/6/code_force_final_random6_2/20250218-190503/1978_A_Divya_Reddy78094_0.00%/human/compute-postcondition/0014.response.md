Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, sorted in descending order.** 

The `nums.sort(reverse=True)` command sorts the list `nums` in descending order, which aligns with the initial state where `nums` is already described as being sorted in descending order. Therefore, the list `nums` remains sorted in descending order, and no other variables are affected.
