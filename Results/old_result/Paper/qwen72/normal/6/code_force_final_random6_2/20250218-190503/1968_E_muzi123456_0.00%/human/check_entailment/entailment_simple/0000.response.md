### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of selecting \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized. Let's break down the program and the logic:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) (where \( 1 \le t \le 50 \)).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) (where \( 2 \le n \le 10^3 \)).

2. **Solution Logic:**
   - The program prints the coordinates of \( n \) cells in the grid.
   - The coordinates are chosen such that all cells are in the first row, i.e., \( (1, i) \) for \( i \) ranging from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Manhattan Distance Analysis:**
   - The Manhattan distance between any two cells \( (1, i) \) and \( (1, j) \) is \( |1 - 1| + |i - j| = |i - j| \).
   - The set of distinct Manhattan distances \( \mathcal{H} \) will be \( \{ |i - j| \mid 1 \le i, j \le n \} \).

4. **Distinct Distances:**
   - For \( n \) cells in the first row, the possible values of \( |i - j| \) range from 0 to \( n-1 \).
   - Therefore, the set \( \mathcal{H} \) will contain \( n \) distinct values: \( \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\} \).

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the coordinates of the cells in the first row.
   - Each test case is handled independently, and the output format is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct because it ensures that the set of distinct Manhattan distances \( \mathcal{H} \) contains \( n \) elements, which is the maximum possible size for the given problem constraints. The choice of cells in the first row guarantees that all possible distances from 0 to \( n-1 \) are included in \( \mathcal{H} \).
