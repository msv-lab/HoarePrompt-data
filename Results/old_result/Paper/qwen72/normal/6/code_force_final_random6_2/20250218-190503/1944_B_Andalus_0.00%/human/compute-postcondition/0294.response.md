The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `ldb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ldb`. If `ldb` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, `ldb` must contain at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element in `ldb`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ldb` must have at least three elements, and `elem` will be the third element in `ldb`.

State: **`i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, `ldb` must contain at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `ldb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2 and `sz` was initially less than `k`, `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `sz` remains 0. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
