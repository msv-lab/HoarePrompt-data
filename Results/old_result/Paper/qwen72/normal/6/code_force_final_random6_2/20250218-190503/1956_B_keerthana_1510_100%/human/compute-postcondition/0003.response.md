Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
   - The file opened by `open(0)` must have at least 5 lines.
   - `line` is the fifth line of the file.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - `line.split()` splits the fifth line of the file into a list of tokens (words) based on whitespace.
   - `tokens` is assigned the result of `line.split()`.
   - `len(tokens)` gives the number of tokens in the list.
   - `{*tokens}` creates a set from the list `tokens`, which removes any duplicate tokens.
   - `len({*tokens})` gives the number of unique tokens in the list.
   - The expression `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` calculates the difference between the total number of tokens and the number of unique tokens, which is the number of duplicate tokens in the list.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the number of duplicate tokens in the fifth line of the file.

Since the exact content of the fifth line is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **number of duplicate tokens in the fifth line of the file** (where the fifth line is split into tokens and the difference between the total number of tokens and the number of unique tokens is calculated).
