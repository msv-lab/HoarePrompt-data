Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n` - 1 or `n` - 2, and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. If `a[r] < a[l]`, then `sunks` remains 0 or is set to 1 depending on the conditions checked before entering this if statement, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, then `l` is updated to 1 if `a[l]` becomes 0 after the subtraction, otherwise `l` remains 0, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]` which is now less than or equal to `a[r]`, `k` is set to 0, and `sunks` is set to 1. If `k` is less than `a[r] * 2` and `a[r] * 2 - 1` is equal to `k`, then `sunks` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sunks` remains 0 or is set to 1 depending on the conditions checked before entering this if statement, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
