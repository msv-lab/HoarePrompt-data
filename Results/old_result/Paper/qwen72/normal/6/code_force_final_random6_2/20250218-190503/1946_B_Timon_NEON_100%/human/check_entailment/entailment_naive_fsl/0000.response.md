Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program is incomplete and does not fully implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Specifically, `func_3` is not implemented, and there is no function to handle the input and output as specified. Additionally, the logic in `func_2` does not correctly identify the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations. For example, consider the test case where `n = 2`, `k = 2`, and `arr = [1, 1]`. The correct output should be `4` (since you can take the entire array and insert its sum twice, resulting in `[1, 1, 2, 2]` with a sum of `6` modulo `10^9 + 7`), but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.
