The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in a ribbon, and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell, where 0 indicates a free cell and 1 indicates a cell with a chip. For each test case, the function removes all leading and trailing free cells (0s) from the list and then counts the number of remaining free cells (0s) in the list. The function prints the count of free cells for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
