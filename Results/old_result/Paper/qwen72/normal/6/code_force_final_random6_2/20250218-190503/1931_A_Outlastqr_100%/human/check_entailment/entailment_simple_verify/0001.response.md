Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that sums up to a given integer `n`, where `n` is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet. The positions range from 1 to 26.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.

3. **Alphabet Initialization**: The program initializes the alphabet using `string.ascii_lowercase`, which is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'. This is correct and necessary for the program to map integers to letters.

4. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: `n > 52`**:
     - If `n` is greater than 52, the program adds the letter corresponding to `n - 53` to the word, followed by 'zz'.
     - This is correct because the maximum sum of the positions of two letters is 52 (26 + 26), so if `n` is greater than 52, the first letter must be at least 'b' (index 2) to allow the remaining two letters to be 'z' (index 26).

   - **Case 2: `n > 27`**:
     - If `n` is between 28 and 52, the program adds 'a' to the word, followed by the letter corresponding to `n - 28`, and then 'z'.
     - This is correct because the maximum sum of the positions of one letter is 26, so if `n` is greater than 27, the first letter must be 'a' (index 1), and the remaining two letters must sum to `n - 1`. The second letter is chosen to be the largest possible letter that allows the third letter to be 'z'.

   - **Case 3: `n == 27`**:
     - If `n` is exactly 27, the program sets the word to 'aay'.
     - This is correct because the only way to get a sum of 27 with three letters is 'a' (index 1), 'a' (index 1), and 'y' (index 25).

   - **Case 4: `n <= 26`**:
     - If `n` is 27 or less, the program adds 'aa' to the word, followed by the letter corresponding to `n - 3`.
     - This is incorrect. The condition should be `n < 27` instead of `n <= 27` to avoid overlapping with the `n == 27` case. Additionally, the sum of the positions of 'a' and 'a' is 2, so the remaining sum is `n - 2`, not `n - 3`. The correct code should be:
       ```python
       elif n < 27:
           word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 2]
       ```

5. **Output**: The program prints the constructed word for each test case, which is the lexicographically smallest word that sums up to `n`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 3 correctly by outputting 'aaa'.
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 78 correctly by outputting 'zzz'.
   - However, the program incorrectly handles the case where `n` is 27, as it should output 'aay' but the current code outputs 'aaa' due to the incorrect condition.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `n` is 27 properly. The condition `n <= 27` should be `n < 27`, and the index calculation should be `n - 2` instead of `n - 3`.

Final: **False**
