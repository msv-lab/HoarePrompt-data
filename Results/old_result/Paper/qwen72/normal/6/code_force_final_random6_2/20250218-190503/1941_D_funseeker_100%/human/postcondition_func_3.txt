The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It initializes `n`, `m`, and `x` by calling `func_3()`. It then performs a series of operations based on the values returned by `func_1()` in a loop that runs `m` times. The function maintains a set `ans` which initially contains the value `x`. For each iteration, it updates `ans` to include all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`, where `r` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1()`. After the loop, if `0` is in `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to `ans`. Finally, the function prints the length of `ans` and the sorted elements of `ans`.
