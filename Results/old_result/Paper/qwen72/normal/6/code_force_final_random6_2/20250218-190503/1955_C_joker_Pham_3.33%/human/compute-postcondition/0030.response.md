Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 1, and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. If `a[l] * 2 - 1` is equal to `k`, `sunks` is set to 1. Otherwise, `sunks` remains 0 and `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`. In both cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
