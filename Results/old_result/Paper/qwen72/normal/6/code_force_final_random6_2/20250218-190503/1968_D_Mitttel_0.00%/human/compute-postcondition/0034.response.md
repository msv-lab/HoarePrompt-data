Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `index` is now `3 * n + 8 + n`, `p` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`, `a` is now a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`, `results` now includes the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**

Explanation: The code snippet `PS = int(data[index + 3])` updates the value of `PS` to the integer value of `data[index + 3]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The new value of `PS` is now explicitly defined as the integer value of `data[index + 3]`.
