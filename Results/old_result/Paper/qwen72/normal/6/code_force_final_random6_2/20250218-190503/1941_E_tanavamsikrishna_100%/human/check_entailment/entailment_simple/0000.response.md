### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Calls:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_2()`.
   - `func_2()` reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d` between supports.
   - It then reads `n` rows of `m` integers each, representing the depths of the river cells.
   - For each row, it calls `func_1(row, d)` to compute the minimum cost of installing supports for that row.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is responsible for calculating the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - It initializes the first element of the row to 1, which is incorrect because the cost of installing a support in the first column should be `a_{i,1} + 1` (which is 1 since `a_{i,1} = 0`).
   - It then adds 2 to the cost of installing supports in the first `d` columns, which is also incorrect. The correct cost should be `a_{i,j} + 1` for each cell.
   - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports up to the current column.
   - The loop iterates from `d` to `m-1`, and for each column, it ensures that the distance between supports is no more than `d` by popping elements from the heap that are too far away.
   - It then updates the cost of installing a support in the current column and pushes the updated cost back into the heap.
   - Finally, it returns the last element of the row, which should be the minimum cost of installing supports for that row.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - It computes the cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1(row, d)`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of every contiguous subsequence of length `k` in the `costs` list.
   - It prints the minimum total cost from the `total_costs` list.

### Issues:
- **Initialization in `func_1`:** The initial cost for the first column should be `1` (since `a_{i,1} = 0`), but the function incorrectly sets `row[0] = 1` and then adds 2 to the first `d` columns. This is incorrect because the cost should be `a_{i,j} + 1` for each cell.
- **Cost Calculation in `func_1`:** The cost calculation inside the loop should be `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1` to account for the depth of the current cell plus 1, but the initial setup of the first `d` columns is flawed.

### Correctness:
- **False**: The program has logical errors in the initialization and cost calculation within `func_1`, which will lead to incorrect results.

### Correctness: **False**
