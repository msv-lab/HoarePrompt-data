Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is increased by 1, `v[x]` is increased by 1.** 

The value of `v[x]` is incremented by 1, where `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`. The value of `n` remains greater than 0, and `idx` has been incremented by 1.
