You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, x and y, which are integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x and y is between 1 and 100 digits. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.

For the first half of the characters in `a` and `b` (up to `len(a) // 2 - 1`), each character in `a` is the maximum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`, and each character in `b` is the minimum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`. For the second half of the characters in `a` and `b` (from `len(a) // 2` to the end), each character in `a` is the minimum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`, and each character in `b` is the maximum of the corresponding characters from the original `a` and `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given two integers `x` and `y` of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.
   - We can swap the i-th digit of `x` with the i-th digit of `y` any number of times.
   - The goal is to maximize the product of `x` and `y`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads the two integers `a` and `b` as lists of characters.
   - It then iterates over each digit of `a` and `b`:
     - For the first half of the digits (i.e., `i <= len(a) // 2 - 1`), it swaps the digits such that the larger digit goes to `a` and the smaller digit goes to `b`.
     - For the second half of the digits (i.e., `i > len(a) // 2 - 1`), it swaps the digits such that the smaller digit goes to `a` and the larger digit goes to `b`.
   - Finally, it prints the modified `a` and `b` as strings.

3. **Evaluating the Logic**:
   - The logic in the program is flawed. The goal is to maximize the product of `x` and `y`, but the program is only swapping digits in a specific pattern (first half and second half) without considering the overall impact on the product.
   - To maximize the product, we should aim to make both `x` and `y` as large as possible. This can be achieved by ensuring that the larger digits are placed in the most significant positions of both numbers.
   - The current logic does not achieve this. For example, if `x = 73` and `y = 31`, the program will swap the digits in the first half, resulting in `x = 71` and `y = 33`. However, the optimal solution would be to swap the digits to get `x = 73` and `y = 31` (or `x = 33` and `y = 71`), which results in a larger product.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly maximize the product of `x` and `y`.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.
