Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans` is the final value after the loop has completed. If `k` is not 0, `ans` is increased by `k // n`, and `res` is increased by `k % n`. If `k` is 0, `ans` and `res` remain unchanged. `ans_list` is a list that contains the value of `ans` as its last element.***
