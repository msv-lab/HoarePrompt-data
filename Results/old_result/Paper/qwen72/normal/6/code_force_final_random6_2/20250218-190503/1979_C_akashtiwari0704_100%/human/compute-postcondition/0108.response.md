Output State: **`bets` is greater than or equal to the initial value of `bets`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `T` is `t`, `ans` is an empty string, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[j]` is now `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, and `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`. Additionally, `sumo` is less than `prod`.**
