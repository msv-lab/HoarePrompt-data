Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arrays` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a beautiful array `a` of integers, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is False, `ans` is the minimum of the counts of consecutive elements equal to `val` before encountering a different element, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `val` at the end of the loop, `ans` is now the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`.**
