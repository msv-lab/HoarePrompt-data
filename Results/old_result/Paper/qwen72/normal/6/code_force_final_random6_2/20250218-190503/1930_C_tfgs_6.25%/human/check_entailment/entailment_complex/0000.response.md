Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, calling the function `func_1` for each.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Reading Input**: The function reads `n` and the list `a` from the user, which is correct based on the problem description.
   - **Modifying the List `a`**: The program increments each element of `a` by its index plus one (`a[i] += i + 1`). This step is correct as it matches the problem's requirement to insert `a_i + i` into the set `S`.
   - **Removing Duplicates and Sorting**: The program then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order. This is correct because the set `S` should contain unique elements, and the final array `b` should be sorted in descending order.
   - **Constructing the Answer List `ans`**:
     - The program uses a `Counter` to keep track of the occurrences of each element in `a`.
     - It iterates over the sorted unique elements of `a` and adds them to `ans`.
     - It also adds additional elements to `ans` to fill the gaps between consecutive elements in the sorted list `a`, ensuring that the total length of `ans` is `n`.
     - The additional elements are chosen to be the largest possible values that do not violate the uniqueness constraint of the set `S`.

3. **Output**: The program prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces, which is the correct output format as specified in the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where all elements in `a` are the same by removing duplicates and ensuring the final list `ans` has the correct length `n`.
   - It also handles the case where the elements in `a` are already unique and sorted in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order of `ans`.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of a `Counter` and set operations are efficient for the given constraints.
   - The sorting step is efficient and necessary to construct the lexicographically largest array `b`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the problem's requirements and handle the inputs and outputs as specified.

Correctness: **True**
