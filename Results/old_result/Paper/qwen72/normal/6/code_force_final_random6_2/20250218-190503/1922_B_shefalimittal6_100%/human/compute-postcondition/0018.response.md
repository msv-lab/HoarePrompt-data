The only variables in the loop head are `n` and the loop counter `_`. The loop can execute again if `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is `n - 1`, which means `n` was greater than 0 and is now one less than it was before. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `v[x]` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `n` must be greater than 0**
