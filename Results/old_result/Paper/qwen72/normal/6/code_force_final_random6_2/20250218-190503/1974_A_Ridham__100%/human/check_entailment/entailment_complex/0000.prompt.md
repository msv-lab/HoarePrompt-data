Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, x and y, where x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        space_x = x * 1
        
        space_y = y * 4
        
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if extra_space % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
        
    #State: `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is an input integer, `result` is a list containing the number of screens required for each iteration of the loop, where the number of screens required for each iteration is calculated as follows: If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`, and if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`. The remaining cells on the screen are calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`. If `space_x` (which is `x`) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, the number of screens required for that iteration is `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, the number of screens required is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is `x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0` or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: 5
    #8
    #10
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Instead, it reads an integer `n` from the user input, indicating the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` (where 0 <= x, y <= 99) from the user input. The function calculates the number of screens required based on the values of `x` and `y`. Specifically, it determines the number of screens needed for `y` (even or odd) and checks if `x` can fit into the remaining cells on those screens. If `x` fits, the number of screens required is the same as for `y`. If `x` does not fit, additional screens are calculated based on the remaining space needed for `x`. The function then prints the number of screens required for each iteration, one per line.
