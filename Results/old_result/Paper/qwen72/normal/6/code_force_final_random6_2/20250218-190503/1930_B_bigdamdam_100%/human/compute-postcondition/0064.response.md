Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `p[0]` is `ind - 6`, `p[2]` is `ind - 4`, `p[4]` is `ind - 4`, `ind` is `ind - 4`**

Explanation: The value of `ind` is decremented by 2. Since `ind` was initially `ind - 2`, after the decrement, it becomes `ind - 4`. The values of `p[0]`, `p[2]`, and `p[4]` are updated accordingly to reflect the new value of `ind`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
