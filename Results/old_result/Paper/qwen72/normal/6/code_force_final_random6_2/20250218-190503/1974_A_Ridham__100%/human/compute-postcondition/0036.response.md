Output State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`, `extra_space` is equal to `x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)`, `extra_screen` is equal to `(x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)) // 15 + 1`.** 

The code snippet `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1` calculates the number of additional screens required based on the `extra_space` value. The `extra_screen` variable is updated to this calculated value, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
