Output State: **`test_cases` list must have at least 3 tuples, the `(n, x, y, arr)` tuple is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `results` list now contains two elements, where the first element is the final value of `count` before the execution of the code, and the second element is the same final value of `count`, `count` is now the sum of the final value of `count` before the execution of the code and the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` increments the value of `count` by the sum of the values obtained from `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`.
- Since `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are both empty dictionaries, `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` will both return 0.
- Therefore, `count` is incremented by 0, meaning its value remains the same as it was before the execution of the code.
- All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
