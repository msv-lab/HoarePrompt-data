Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 1, `arr` is [0], `c` is 1, `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The value of `c` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. Since `c` is now 1, it is not equal to `n - 1`, so the condition for `ans` to contain the value `k0` is not met, and `ans` remains an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values.
