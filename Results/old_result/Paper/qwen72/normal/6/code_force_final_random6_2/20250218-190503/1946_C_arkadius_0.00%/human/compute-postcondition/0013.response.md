To determine what will be printed by the `print(func_4(tree, n, k))` statement, we need to understand the context and the behavior of the `func_4` function. However, the function `func_4` is not provided in the code snippet, so we need to infer its behavior based on the initial state and the typical operations that might be performed on a tree structure.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`n`**: This is the number of nodes in the tree.
2. **`i`**: This is `n - 1`, which is the number of edges in the tree. A tree with `n` nodes will have exactly `n - 1` edges.
3. **`k`**: This is an integer read from the input.
4. **`tree`**: This is an instance of the `Tree` class. The tree is constructed with `n` nodes and `n - 1` edges, where each edge connects nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1`. The tree is rooted at node 0, and the parent of node 0 is -1 (indicating it has no parent).

### Function `func_4`:
Since the function `func_4` is not defined, we can only make an educated guess based on typical operations performed on trees. Common operations include:
- Calculating the depth of nodes.
- Finding the longest path in the tree.
- Performing some operation involving the integer `k`.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **Depth Calculation**: If `func_4` calculates the depth of the tree or the maximum depth of any node, it might return an integer value.
2. **Path Calculation**: If `func_4` finds the longest path in the tree, it might return the length of that path.
3. **Subtree Size**: If `func_4` calculates the size of subtrees, it might return a list or a specific value related to the subtree sizes.
4. **K-related Operation**: If `func_4` performs an operation involving the integer `k`, it might return a value based on that operation.

### Most Likely Scenario:
Given that `k` is an input integer and the tree is rooted at node 0, a common operation might be to find the number of nodes at a distance `k` from the root node. This is a typical problem in tree traversal.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Tree Construction**: The tree is constructed with `n` nodes and `n - 1` edges, and it is rooted at node 0.
2. **Function Call**: `func_4(tree, n, k)` is called, which likely performs a traversal of the tree to find nodes at a distance `k` from the root.
3. **Output**: The function will return the number of nodes at distance `k` from the root node.

### Final Output:
Since the exact implementation of `func_4` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the function's likely behavior.

Output: **number of nodes at distance k from the root node (where k is the integer read from the input and the root node is node 0)**
