Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `bets` is greater than or equal to its initial value.
   - `i` is `bets - 1`.
   - `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`.
   - `T` is `t`.
   - `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space.
   - `a` is a list of integers where each `a[j]` is now `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`.
   - `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`.
   - The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **-1**
