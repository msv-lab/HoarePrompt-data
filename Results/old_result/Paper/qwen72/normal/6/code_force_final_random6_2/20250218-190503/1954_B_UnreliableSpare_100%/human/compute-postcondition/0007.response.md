Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arrays` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a beautiful array `a` of integers, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `flag` is True. If the second element of `arr` is not equal to the first element of `arr`, `flag` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
