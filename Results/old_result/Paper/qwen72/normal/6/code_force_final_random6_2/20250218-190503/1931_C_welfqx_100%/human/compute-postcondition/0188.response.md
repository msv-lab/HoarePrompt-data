Postcondition: ***`onum` is reversed, `onum` is a copy of `num` but in reverse order, `ii` is `n - 2`, `r` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `j` is the index where the first inequality was found, `symb1` is the first character of `num`, `symb2` is the first character of `onum`, `i` is `n - 2`, and if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is `cn + ck`. If all characters in `num` from index 0 to `n - 2` are equal to their respective next characters, `cn` is `2 * (n - 1)` and `j` is the index where the first inequality was found. If `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]` for all `ii` in the range `0` to `n - 2`, `ck` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `ck` is the number of consecutive characters from the start of `onum` that are equal to their respective next characters, and the loop breaks at the first inequality. Additionally, if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `symb1` and `symb2` are the same.***
