You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `t`, the loop has completed all iterations. For each of the `t` test cases, the variables `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`, and `cost` have been updated and printed according to the logic of the loop. The final `cost` for each test case has been calculated and printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and the list of ticket prices `M`.

2. **Constraints Handling**:
   - The program sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure that the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a day does not exceed the total number of tickets needed.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `M` in ascending order. This is a good strategy because it allows us to buy tickets at the lowest possible prices first.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days**:
   - The program calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`, which is the minimum number of days required to buy `k` tickets. This is correct because if `k` is not a multiple of `m`, we need an additional day to buy the remaining tickets.

5. **Selecting the Cheapest Days**:
   - The program selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` to get the cheapest prices. This is a valid approach because we want to minimize the cost.

6. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If `n * m == k`, it means we can buy exactly `k` tickets by purchasing `m` tickets each day for `n` days. The cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, where `sum(N)` is the sum of the prices of the selected days, and `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` accounts for the additional cost due to the price increase.
   - If `n * m != k`, it means we need to buy a different number of tickets on the last day. The program calculates the cost for the last day separately and then adds the cost for the remaining days. This is done by popping the last element `w` from `N`, calculating the number of tickets `mu` to be bought on the last day, and then adding the cost for the remaining days.

7. **Final Cost Calculation**:
   - The final cost is calculated by summing up the costs for the selected days and the additional costs due to price increases.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Calculation of `q`**:
  - The program calculates `q` as `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, which is correct. However, the subsequent logic to handle the cost calculation is flawed.
  - The program should handle the case where `k` is not a multiple of `m` more carefully. Specifically, the cost calculation for the last day and the additional days should be more precise.

- **Incorrect Cost Calculation for Remaining Days**:
  - The program adds an extra term `n * m * mu` in the cost calculation, which is incorrect. This term is not needed and can lead to an overestimation of the cost.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (n, m, k) = (L[0], L[1], L[2])
        m = min(m, k)
        M.sort()
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        N = M[:q]
        n = len(N)
        
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = m * sum(N[:-1]) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + mu * N[-1] + (n - 1) * mu * m
        
        print(cost)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Cost Calculation for Exact Multiples**:
  - If `n * m == k`, the cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, which is correct.

- **Cost Calculation for Non-Exact Multiples**:
  - If `n * m != k`, the program calculates the cost for the first `n-1` days and then the cost for the last day separately.
  - `mu` is the number of tickets to be bought on the last day.
  - The cost for the first `n-1` days is `m * sum(N[:-1]) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2)`.
  - The cost for the last day is `mu * N[-1] + (n - 1) * mu * m`.

### Final Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program has issues in the cost calculation for the last day and the additional days, leading to incorrect results. The corrected program addresses these issues and should provide the correct minimum spending.
