Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1`: This means `i` is the last index of the list `rgt`.
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index.
   - `sz` is 0: This is the size of `rdb`, which is currently 0.
   - `ldb` must contain at least one element: This means `ldb` is a non-empty list.
   - `elem` is the first element in `ldb`: This is the value of the first element in the list `ldb`.
   - The current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2: This means `k` is at least 2 since `sz` is 0.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement: This condition is not met since `sz` is 0 and `k` is at least 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`: This statement prints the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space.

3. **Explanation:**
   - Since `elem` is the first element in the list `ldb`, and `ldb` must contain at least one element, `elem` has a specific value.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

Given the initial state, the value of `elem` is the first element in the list `ldb`. The print statement will print this value twice, followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the first element in the list `ldb`)**
