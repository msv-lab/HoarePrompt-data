Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user.** 

Explanation: The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `L`. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
