The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a string of space-separated integers from the user input, converts each of these strings to integers, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `n` integers, but after this code, `a` is reassigned to a new list of integers based on the user input. The length of this new list is determined by the number of integers provided in the input, which may or may not be equal to `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer input by the user where 2 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user.**
