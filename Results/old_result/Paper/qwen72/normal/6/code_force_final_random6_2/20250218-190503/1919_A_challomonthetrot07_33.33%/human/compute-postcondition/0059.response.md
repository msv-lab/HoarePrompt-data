The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on test cases where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. The function likely processes these test cases internally and returns a result based on the values of `a` and `b` for each test case.

Since the exact output is not specified, we can infer that the function might return a list or a collection of results, one for each test case. Each result could be based on some operation or comparison involving `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases where each test case includes two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). It returns a result for each test case, likely based on some operation or comparison involving `a` and `b`.**
