Output State: **`lst` remains a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is the sum of the first `n - 2` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from the second-to-last element to the end of `lst` plus `(len(lst) - 1 - (n - 2) + 1) ** 2`. If this `sm` > `over_sum`, `r` is `n - 2`, `l` is `len(lst) - 1`, and `over_sum` is updated to this `sm`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The list `lst` remains unchanged with its original length `n`.
- The variable `i` is still `n - 2` because the loop only increments `j` and not `i`.
- The variable `j` has reached the last index of the list, which is `len(lst) - 1`.
- The variable `sm` is calculated as the sum of the first `n - 2` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from the second-to-last element to the end of `lst` plus the square of the number of elements between `i` and `j` (inclusive), which is `(len(lst) - 1 - (n - 2) + 1) ** 2`.
- If this new `sm` is greater than the previously recorded `over_sum`, then `r` and `l` are updated to `[n - 2, len(lst) - 1]`, and `over_sum` is updated to this new `sm`. Otherwise, `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` retain their previous values.
