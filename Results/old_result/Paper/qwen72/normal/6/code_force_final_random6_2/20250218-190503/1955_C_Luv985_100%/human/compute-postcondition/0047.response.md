Output State: **`T` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 10^4) decreased by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 1), `k` is the second integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 0), `a` is a list of integers representing the input split by spaces, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `t` is `k % 2`, `ans` is 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, otherwise `ans` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
