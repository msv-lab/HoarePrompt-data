To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The state of `i` and `n` must be such that the loop can start and run at least once.

Given:
- `i` is `2 * n - 1`
- `n` is greater than 0

The loop statement is:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be initialized to 0 (the starting value for the loop variable `i`).

However, the initial state provided (`i` is `2 * n - 1`) is not relevant to the loop head because `i` will be reinitialized to 0 by the `for` loop. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
