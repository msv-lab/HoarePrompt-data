### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `t` times, each time calling the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program reads an integer `n` which is the length of the string `s`.
   - It then reads the string `s` which consists of characters '+' and '-'.
   - The variable `neg` is initialized to 0. This variable will count the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.
   - The program iterates through each character in `s` and increments `neg` by 1 for each '-' character.
   - Finally, the program calculates the penalty using the formula `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n` and prints the result.

3. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - The penalty is calculated based on the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` is derived from the observation that each '+' character contributes 1 to the sum, and each '-' character contributes -1.
   - If the number of '+' and '-' characters is not equal, the optimal way to split the array is to split it into individual elements, which results in a penalty of `n` (since each element's penalty is 1).
   - If the number of '+' and '-' characters is equal, the optimal way to split the array is to pair each '+' with a '-' to make the sum of each pair zero, resulting in a penalty of 0.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 1 (as shown in the first test case).
   - The program also correctly handles the case where all characters are '-' (as shown in the second test case).
   - The program correctly handles the case where the number of '+' and '-' characters is equal (as shown in the third test case).

5. **General Cases**:
   - The program correctly calculates the penalty for cases where the number of '+' and '-' characters is not equal, such as the fourth and fifth test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty for the given problem. It handles all the provided test cases and edge cases correctly.

**Correctness: True**
