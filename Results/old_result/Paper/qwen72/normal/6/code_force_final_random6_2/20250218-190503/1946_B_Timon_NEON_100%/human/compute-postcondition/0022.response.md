Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is [arr[0], 0] if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `new_segment` remains an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, and `max_sum` is -1.***
