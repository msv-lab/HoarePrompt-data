Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and `arr` must have at least two elements. `i` is 1. `max_segment[0]` is now `max_segment[0] + arr[1]`. If `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is a list containing the second element of `arr` and the integer 1. Otherwise, `new_segment` is not modified.**
