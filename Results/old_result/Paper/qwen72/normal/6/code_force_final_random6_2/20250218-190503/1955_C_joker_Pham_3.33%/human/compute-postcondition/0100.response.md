Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n` - 1, `n` - 2, or `n` - 3, with `a[l]` less than or equal to `a[r]`. If `k` >= `a[r]`, `sunks` is increased by 1. If `k` < `a[r]`, no changes are made to `sunks`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
