Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 4, `i` is 4, `p` is a list where the first element is `n`, `p[2]` is `n - 2`, and `p[4]` is `n - 4`, `ind` is equal to `n - 6`.**

Explanation: The value of `ind` is decreased by 2. Initially, `ind` was equal to `n - 4`. After the decrement, `ind` is now equal to `n - 6`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and the list `p`) remain unchanged.
