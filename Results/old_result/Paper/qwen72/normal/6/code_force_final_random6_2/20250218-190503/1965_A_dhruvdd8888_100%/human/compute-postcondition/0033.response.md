Output State: **`test_cases` remains a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The length of `test_cases` is `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `N` is an input integer. `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 5 elements, and all elements modified such that each element `nums[i]` is now `nums[i] - (nums[0] + nums[1] - nums[0] + ... + nums[i-1] - (nums[i-2] + ... + nums[0]))`. `ls` is the sum of all elements in the modified `nums` list. `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 4`. `nw` is `True`. `cw` is `True` or `cw` is `False` depending on the value of `nums[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `nw = cw` assigns the value of `cw` to `nw`.
- If `nums[i]` is 1, `cw` is `False` and `nw` is `True`.
- Otherwise, `cw` is `True` and `nw` is `True`.
- Therefore, `nw` is `True` in both cases.
- The values of `test_cases`, `N`, `nums`, `ls`, and `i` remain unchanged.
