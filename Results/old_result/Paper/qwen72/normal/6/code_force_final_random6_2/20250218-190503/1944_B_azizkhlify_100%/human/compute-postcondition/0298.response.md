Output State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list containing elements from `a` based on certain conditions, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[i] - 1` is now 0, `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` (from the first `n` elements) that were equal to 2 in `l` and were reset to 0, `ur` remains 0, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ul` is not equal to `ur`.**
