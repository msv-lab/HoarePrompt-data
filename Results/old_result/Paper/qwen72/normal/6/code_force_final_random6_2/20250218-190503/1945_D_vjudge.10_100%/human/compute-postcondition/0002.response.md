Postcondition: **`pergunta` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), `a` is a list of n integers where each a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) represents the cost to bribe the i-th person, `b` is a list of n integers where each b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) represents the cost to bribe each person between positions j and i-1 when Kirill moves to position j, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `x` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `i` is less than `m`.**
