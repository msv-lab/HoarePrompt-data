Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]`, `new_segment` is either `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, or an empty list if `arr[0]` is less than 0, and `segments_variants` is a list containing a single element `[0, 0, -1]` if `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, or a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [0] if `new_segment` is not empty.**

Explanation:
- The code `new_segment[0] += arr[i]` updates the first element of `new_segment` by adding `arr[1]` to it.
- If `new_segment` is not empty (i.e., `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0), `new_segment[0]` becomes `arr[0] + arr[1]`.
- If `new_segment` is empty (i.e., `arr[0]` is less than 0), the code has no effect because `new_segment` is an empty list and cannot be updated.
- The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `max_sum`, `max_segment`, and `segments_variants`) remain unchanged.
