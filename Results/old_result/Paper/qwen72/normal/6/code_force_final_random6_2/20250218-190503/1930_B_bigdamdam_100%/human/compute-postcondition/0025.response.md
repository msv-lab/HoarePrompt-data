Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is greater than 0.
2. `i` is `n` if `n` is even, or `n - 1` if `n` is odd.
3. `p` is a list where:
   - Every even-indexed element (starting from 0) is filled with values decreasing by 2 starting from `n` down to `n - (n // 2) * 2`.
   - Every odd-indexed element (starting from 1) is filled with values starting from 1 or 2 (depending on whether `n` is odd or even) and increasing by 2.
4. `ind` is `n` if `n` is even, or `n + 1` if `n` is odd.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `i` and `ind` based on `n`:**
   - If `n` is even:
     - `i = n`
     - `ind = n`
   - If `n` is odd:
     - `i = n - 1`
     - `ind = n + 1`

2. **Construct the list `p`:**
   - **Even-indexed elements:**
     - Start from `n` and decrease by 2 until `n - (n // 2) * 2`.
     - For example, if `n = 6`, the even-indexed elements will be `[6, 4, 2]`.
   - **Odd-indexed elements:**
     - Start from 1 or 2 (depending on whether `n` is odd or even) and increase by 2.
     - For example, if `n = 6`, the odd-indexed elements will be `[1, 3, 5]`.
     - If `n = 5`, the odd-indexed elements will be `[2, 4, 6]`.

3. **Combine the elements to form the list `p`:**
   - The list `p` will alternate between the even-indexed and odd-indexed elements.
   - For `n = 6`, `p` will be `[6, 1, 4, 3, 2, 5]`.
   - For `n = 5`, `p` will be `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`.

### Example Calculations:
- **If `n = 6`:**
  - `i = 6`
  - `ind = 6`
  - Even-indexed elements: `[6, 4, 2]`
  - Odd-indexed elements: `[1, 3, 5]`
  - `p = [6, 1, 4, 3, 2, 5]`
  - Output: **6 1 4 3 2 5**

- **If `n = 5`:**
  - `i = 4`
  - `ind = 6`
  - Even-indexed elements: `[5, 3, 1]`
  - Odd-indexed elements: `[2, 4, 6]`
  - `p = [5, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`
  - Output: **5 2 3 4 1 6**

### General Case:
- **If `n` is even:**
  - Even-indexed elements: `[n, n-2, n-4, ..., 2]`
  - Odd-indexed elements: `[1, 3, 5, ..., n-1]`
  - `p` will be `[n, 1, n-2, 3, n-4, 5, ..., 2, n-1]`

- **If `n` is odd:**
  - Even-indexed elements: `[n, n-2, n-4, ..., 1]`
  - Odd-indexed elements: `[2, 4, 6, ..., n+1]`
  - `p` will be `[n, 2, n-2, 4, n-4, 6, ..., 1, n+1]`

### Final Output:
The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces. The list `p` is constructed based on the rules described above.

Output: **[n, 1, n-2, 3, n-4, 5, ..., 2, n-1] (if n is even) or [n, 2, n-2, 4, n-4, 6, ..., 1, n+1] (if n is odd)**

This output describes the elements of the list `p` in the order they will be printed, depending on whether `n` is even or odd.
