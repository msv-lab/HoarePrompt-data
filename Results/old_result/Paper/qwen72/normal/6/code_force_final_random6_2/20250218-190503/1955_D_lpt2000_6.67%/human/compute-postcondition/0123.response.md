Postcondition: **`nabors` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer greater than `m`, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `aa` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `in_aa` is the third element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the third element of `aa[:n - m]`, `_` is a placeholder, `bb` is a list of integers provided by the new user input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the minimum frequency of common elements between the current window of `m` elements in `aa` and all elements in `bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in the current window of `m` elements in `aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in `bb` that are not in `D`, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`. If `C[in_aa]` > 0, `C[in_aa]` is increased by 1 if `C[in_aa]` is equal to `D[in_aa]`, otherwise `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and `tot` is increased by 1 if `D[in_aa]` was 0 before the increment. If `C[in_aa]` is 0, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1. In all cases, `fnd` remains the same. If `D[out_aa]` > 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` > 0, otherwise `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 and `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, `fnd` is incremented by 1, otherwise `fnd` remains the same. If `D[out_aa]` is 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.**
