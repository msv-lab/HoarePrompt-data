You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: `i` is `int(input()) - 1`, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `s` is the last input string, `a` is the integer value of the first word in the last `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in the last `s`.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: bob
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: `i` is `int(input()) - 1`, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `s` is the last input string, `a` is the integer value of the first word in the last `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in the last `s`. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the sum remains even. If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the sum remains odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters. It reads a series of inputs from the user, where each input is a string containing two integers separated by a space. The function processes the last input string, extracting the two integers `a` and `b`. It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints "bob". If the sum is odd, it prints "alice". The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the last input string and the extracted integers `a` and `b` are the final state of the program.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only checks if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd and prints "bob" or "alice" based on that. However, the game involves strategic moves and the ability to swap wallets, which the program does not account for.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 2
```
According to the problem description, Alice can win by swapping wallets with Bob on her first move, making the game state (a=1, b=1). Bob then cannot make a move because he would need to remove a coin from his wallet, which would leave it empty. Therefore, Alice wins. However, the program will output "bob" because (1 + 2) % 2 == 1, which is incorrect.

The program needs to simulate the game moves and determine the winner based on the optimal strategy, not just a simple parity check.
