Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n` - 1, `n` - 2, or `n` - 3, `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`.
- The values of `n`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` specified in the initial state are still valid.
- No changes are made to `sunks` in this code snippet.
