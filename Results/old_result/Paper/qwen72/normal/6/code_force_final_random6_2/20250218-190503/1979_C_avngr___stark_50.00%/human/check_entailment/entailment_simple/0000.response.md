### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to distribute coins such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \(i\), if it wins, you receive \(k_i \times x_i\) coins, where \(x_i\) is the amount you bet on outcome \(i\).
   - The total amount bet is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\).
   - The condition to satisfy is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program calculates the product of all \(k_i\) values and assigns it to `m`.
   - It then calculates the bet for each outcome as \(c_i = \frac{m}{k_i}\).
   - The `func_1` function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list `c`.
   - The program then divides each \(c_i\) by the GCD to minimize the bets.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the bets is less than \(\frac{m}{\text{GCD}}\). If it is, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Product Calculation (`m`):** The product of all \(k_i\) values is calculated correctly.
   - **Bet Calculation (`c`):** Each bet \(c_i\) is calculated as \(\frac{m}{k_i}\), which ensures that the total amount received back for any winning outcome is \(m\).
   - **GCD Calculation:** The GCD of the list `c` is calculated correctly using the `gcd` function.
   - **Minimizing Bets:** Dividing each \(c_i\) by the GCD ensures that the bets are minimized while maintaining the condition.
   - **Sum Check:** The program correctly checks if the sum of the minimized bets is less than \(\frac{m}{\text{GCD}}\). If it is, the bets are valid; otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program assumes that the product of all \(k_i\) values will be a valid integer. However, the product of up to 50 numbers, each up to 20, can be extremely large, potentially leading to overflow issues in some environments.
   - The program should use the `math.gcd` function correctly, which it does.
   - The program should handle the case where the sum of the minimized bets is not strictly less than \(\frac{m}{\text{GCD}}\), which it does.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program follows the logic correctly and should work for the given constraints.
   - The only potential issue is the large product calculation, but Python's integer type can handle very large numbers, so this is not a practical concern.
