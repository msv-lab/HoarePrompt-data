Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 1, `sunks` is 0, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`, and `a[l] * 2 - 1` is not equal to `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
