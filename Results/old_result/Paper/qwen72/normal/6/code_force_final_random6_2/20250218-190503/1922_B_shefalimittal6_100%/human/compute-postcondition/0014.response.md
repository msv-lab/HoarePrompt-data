The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 0. Since the loop variable `_` is not explicitly used, it does not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `v[x]` is 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `n` is now `n - 1`**
