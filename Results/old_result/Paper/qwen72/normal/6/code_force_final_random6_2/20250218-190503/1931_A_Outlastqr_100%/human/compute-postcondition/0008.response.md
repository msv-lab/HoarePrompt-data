Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 27 and less than or equal to 52, `word` is the string 'a' followed by the character at index `n - 28` in the string `alphabet` followed by 'z'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `word` is updated to be the string 'a' concatenated with the character at index `n - 28` in the string `alphabet`, and then concatenated with 'z'.
- The value of `n` is an input integer, and it is specified that `n` is greater than 27 and less than or equal to 52.
- The other variables (`t`, `i`) remain unchanged.
