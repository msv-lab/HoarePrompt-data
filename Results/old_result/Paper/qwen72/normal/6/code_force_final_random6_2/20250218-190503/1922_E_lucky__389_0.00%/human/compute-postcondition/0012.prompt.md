Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is an input integer minus 1 and `x` must not be 0, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a single positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is an input integer minus 1 and `x` must not be 0, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a single positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `x` is an input integer minus 1 and `x` must be greater than or equal to 7, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a single positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 3.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `x` is an input integer minus 1 and `x` must be greater than or equal to 31, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a single positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 5.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
