Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, and `r` is `n` - 1, `n` - 2, or `n` - 3. If `a[l]` <= `a[r]` and `k` >= `a[l] * 2`, `sunks` is increased by 1, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `a[l]` <= `a[r]` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[l]` <= `a[r]`, `l` == `r`, and `k` >= `a[r]`, `sunks` is increased by 1. If `a[l]` <= `a[r]`, `l` == `r`, and `k` < `a[r]`, no changes are made to `sunks`. If `a[l]` > `a[r]` or `k` == 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
