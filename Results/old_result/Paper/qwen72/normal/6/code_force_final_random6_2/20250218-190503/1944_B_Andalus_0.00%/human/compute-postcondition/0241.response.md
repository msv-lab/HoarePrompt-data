Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until `sz` reaches `k`, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to the negative of the number of elements in `sng` that were processed, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, `sng` must have at least as many elements as were processed, `rdb` must have at least as many elements as were processed. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop breaks out.**

Explanation:
- The code `lst = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `lst`.
- The initial state mentions that `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, so this operation updates `lst` to the new list of integers.
- All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
