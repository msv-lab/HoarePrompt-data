Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used to count occurrences of "map" and "pie" and then subtract the count of "mapie" does not account for the overlapping occurrences of these substrings or the minimum deletions required to remove them. 

For example, in the string "mmapnapie", the program counts "map" once and "pie" once, and "mapie" zero times, leading to a result of 1, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 2, as you need to delete the 4th and 9th characters to make the string beautiful.

A correct approach would involve identifying the positions of the substrings "map" and "pie" and calculating the minimum deletions required to remove these substrings, considering their overlaps.
