Output State: **`onum` is reversed, `onum` is a copy of `num` but in reverse order, `ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is 1, `r` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, `j` is the index where the first inequality was found, `symb1` is the first character of `num`, `symb2` is the first character of `onum`, `i` is 1, `cn` is 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cn += 1` increments the value of `cn` by 1. Initially, `cn` is 1, so after the increment, `cn` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
