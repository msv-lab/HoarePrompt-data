Output State: **t is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4), n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9), a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), x is a list of n integers (-n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < ... < x_n ≤ n; x_i ≠ 0). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
