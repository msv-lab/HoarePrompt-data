The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 1, so the new value of `i` is 2. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len(arr)} \leq 2 \times 10^5\), and each element \(a_i\) in `arr` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq \text{len(arr)}\). The first element of `arr` (`arr[0]`) is equal to the last element of `arr` (`arr[\text{len(arr)} - 1]`). If `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is 2 and `j` is \(\text{len(arr)} - 3\). Otherwise, `i` is 2, `j` is \(\text{len(arr)} - 2\), and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
