Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are lists, `s` is 0. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of list `b`. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of list `a`. The value of `lit[i]` is appended to the list `b`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `lit[i]` (which is `lit[2]` since `i` is 2) is appended to the list `b`.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `a`, `s`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.
- If `b` was initially empty, it now contains the value `lit[2]`.
- If `b` was not initially empty, it now has an additional element at the end, which is `lit[2]`.
- The value of `y` will be updated to the new last element of `b` if `b` was not empty before, or it will remain as infinity if `b` was empty before and `lit[2]` is the first element added.
- The value of `x` remains unchanged and is still determined by the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, or set to infinity if `a` is empty.
