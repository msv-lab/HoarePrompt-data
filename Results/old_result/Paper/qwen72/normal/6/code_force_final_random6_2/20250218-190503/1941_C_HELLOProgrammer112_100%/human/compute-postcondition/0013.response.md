Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `int(input())` must be greater than 1. This is a precondition that ensures the input is a valid integer greater than 1, but it doesn't affect the variables used in the `print` statement.
2. `_` is 1. This variable is not used in the `print` statement.
3. `a` is an input integer greater than 0. This variable is not used in the `print` statement.
4. `s` is a new input string. This string is provided by the user and is used to calculate `x`, `y`, and `z`.
5. `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`.
6. `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.
7. `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in the new `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(x + y - z)
```

### Explanation:
- `x` is the count of occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`.
- `y` is the count of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`.
- `z` is the count of occurrences of the substring 'mapie' in the string `s`.

The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `x + y - z`.

### Example Calculation:
- If `s = "mapmapiepie"`, then:
  - `x` (number of 'map' occurrences) = 2
  - `y` (number of 'pie' occurrences) = 2
  - `z` (number of 'mapie' occurrences) = 1
  - The expression `x + y - z` = 2 + 2 - 1 = 3

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the sum of the number of times 'map' appears in `s` and the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`, minus the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`.

Output: **x + y - z (where x is the number of times 'map' appears in s, y is the number of times 'pie' appears in s, and z is the number of times 'mapie' appears in s)**
