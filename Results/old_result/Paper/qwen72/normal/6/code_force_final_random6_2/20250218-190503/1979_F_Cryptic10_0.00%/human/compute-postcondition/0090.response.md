Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a non-negative integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^5) representing the number of vertices in a graph. It constructs a path that includes all integers from 1 to `n` in some order. After the function completes, it prints the path in the format "! 1 2 3 ... n" (with the integers in some order from 1 to `n`), and flushes the output buffer. The function does not return any value. **
