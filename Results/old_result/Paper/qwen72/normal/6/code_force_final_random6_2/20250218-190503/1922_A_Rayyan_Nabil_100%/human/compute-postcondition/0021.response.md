The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least one element, the loop will execute. Given the state before the loop starts, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended `t` times, where `0 < t <= 1000`, this means `results` must have at least one element for the loop to execute. Therefore, `results` must not be empty, and `result` will be the first element in the `results` list.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended `t` times and must have at least 1 element, `result` is the first element in the `results` list, `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed**
