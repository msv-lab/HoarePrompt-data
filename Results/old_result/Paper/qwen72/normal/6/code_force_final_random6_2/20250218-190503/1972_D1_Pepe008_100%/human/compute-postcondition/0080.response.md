The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function works with two positive integers `n` and `m` where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. Since the output is not specified, we can infer that the function might return a value or perform some operation based on these constraints, but without further details, we cannot determine the exact output.

Functionality: **The function works with two positive integers `n` and `m` where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The exact return value or output is not specified.**
