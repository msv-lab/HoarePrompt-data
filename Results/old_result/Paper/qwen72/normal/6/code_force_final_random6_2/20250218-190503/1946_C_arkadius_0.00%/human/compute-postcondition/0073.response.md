Output State: **The tree remains a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is updated to the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `v` is updated to the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `stack` is a list with all the children of the current `v` appended to it in the form `(u, False)`, and the tuple `(v, True)` has been appended to `stack` for each vertex `v` that was processed.**

In natural language, this means:
- The `tree` object and its structure remain unchanged.
- The variables `s` and `x` retain their initial values.
- The `postorder` variable is updated to the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack` at each iteration.
- The `v` variable is updated to the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack` at each iteration.
- The `stack` list is updated by appending tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of the current `v` and also appending the tuple `(v, True)` for each `v` that was processed. This continues until all children of the current `v` have been processed and appended to the `stack`.
