Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Input Parsing in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to read a binary string, but it uses `input().split()`, which is intended for splitting a string by spaces. Since the input is a single binary string without spaces, this will not work as intended.
   - The correct way to read a binary string would be to use `input()` directly and then convert it to a list of integers using a list comprehension or a similar method.

2. **Logic for Calculating the Minimum Cost**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is incorrect. The function is trying to count the number of 1s and add a cost whenever a 0 is encountered after a 1. However, this does not correctly account for the minimum cost required to sort the string.
   - The correct approach involves finding the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed to move all 1s to the right of all 0s. This can be done by finding the longest contiguous segment of 1s and 0s and then calculating the cost based on the positions of these segments.

3. **Output**:
   - The function `func_1` prints the result directly, which is not the correct way to handle multiple test cases. Instead, the result should be collected and printed after all test cases have been processed.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you should:
- Read the number of test cases.
- For each test case, read the binary string.
- Calculate the minimum cost to sort the string by finding the longest contiguous segment of 1s and 0s and then determining the cost based on the positions of these segments.
- Print the result for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_cost_to_sort(s):
    n = len(s)
    max_ones = 0
    current_ones = 0
    for i in range(2 * n):
        if s[i % n] == '1':
            current_ones += 1
        else:
            max_ones = max(max_ones, current_ones)
            current_ones = 0
    max_ones = max(max_ones, current_ones)
    return n - max_ones

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        print(min_cost_to_sort(s))

func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`min_cost_to_sort(s)`**:
  - This function calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string `s`.
  - It iterates through the string twice (to account for cyclic shifts) and keeps track of the longest contiguous segment of 1s.
  - The minimum cost is then calculated as the length of the string minus the length of the longest segment of 1s.
- **`func_2()`**:
  - This function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `min_cost_to_sort` and printing the result.

This corrected program should work correctly for the given problem.
