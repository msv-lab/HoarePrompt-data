Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `position` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial `n` (including the leading 1).**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is not zero.
- In each iteration, `n` is right-shifted by 1 bit, which effectively divides `n` by 2 and discards the remainder.
- The variable `position` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, counting the number of times the loop has executed.
- The loop will stop when `n` becomes 0, which happens after `position` has been incremented to the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial `n`.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- Therefore, after all iterations, `n` will be 0, `k` will still be an integer within its initial range, and `position` will be the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial `n`.
