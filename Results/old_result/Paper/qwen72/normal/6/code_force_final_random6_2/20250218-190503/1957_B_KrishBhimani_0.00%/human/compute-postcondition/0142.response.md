The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on a set of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. The function processes these test cases and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each case. The constraints are as follows:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Given this information, the function `func` is expected to return a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and returns a result for each test case. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
