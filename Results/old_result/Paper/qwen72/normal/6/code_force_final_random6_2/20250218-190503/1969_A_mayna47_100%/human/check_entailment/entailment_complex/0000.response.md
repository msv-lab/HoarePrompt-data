Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. The function `func_1` is responsible for processing each test case.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of friends `n` and the list `v` (which is `p` in the problem description) from the input.
   - It correctly initializes `v` as a list of length `n + 1` to handle 1-based indexing.

2. **Checking for Mutual Best Friends**:
   - The function iterates over each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - It checks if `v[v[i]] == i`, which means the i-th friend and the p_i-th friend are each other's best friends.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns, as inviting both friends in the pair will ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

3. **Default Case**:
   - If no mutual best friend pairs are found, the function prints `3` and returns.
   - This is based on the assumption that if there are no mutual best friend pairs, the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3. This is because inviting 3 friends will always ensure that at least 2 of them have their best friends also invited, thus they will come to the party.

4. **Test Case Handling**:
   - The main loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` to process the input and print the result.

However, there is a potential issue with the program:
- **Edge Case Handling**: The program assumes that if no mutual best friend pairs are found, the minimum number of invitations required is always 3. This is not necessarily true. For example, if the best friend relationships form a cycle of length greater than 2, inviting 3 friends might not be the minimum number of invitations needed. The correct approach would be to find the smallest cycle or chain of best friends that ensures at least 2 friends come to the party.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program works correctly for the given test cases, but it might not handle all possible edge cases correctly. Specifically, it does not account for cycles of length greater than 2 or other complex structures in the best friend relationships.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible scenarios where the best friend relationships form cycles or chains that require a different number of invitations to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
