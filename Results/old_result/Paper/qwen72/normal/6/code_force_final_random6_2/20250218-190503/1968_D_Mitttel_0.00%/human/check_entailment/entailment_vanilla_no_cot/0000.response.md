Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game" as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function initializes the scores for Bodya and Sasha by calling `calculate_score` for their respective starting positions.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

2. **Function 2 (`calculate_score`)**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position.
   - It keeps track of the current position, the score, and the number of steps taken.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to detect cycles in the permutation.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining turns by:
     - Determining the length and score of the cycle.
     - Adding the score for full cycles.
     - Adding the score for the remaining steps after full cycles.
   - If no cycle is detected, it simply continues to add scores until the number of steps reaches `k`.

3. **Function 3 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the input data from `stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It collects the results and prints them at the end.

The program handles the input and output as required, and the logic for calculating scores and determining the winner is consistent with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
