The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `books`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. `books` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains `n` integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of pages in each book for a test case, and each integer `a_i` in the inner list satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function returns the number of books that have an odd number of pages.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and `books`, a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the number of pages in each book. It returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the count of books with an odd number of pages for the corresponding test case.**
