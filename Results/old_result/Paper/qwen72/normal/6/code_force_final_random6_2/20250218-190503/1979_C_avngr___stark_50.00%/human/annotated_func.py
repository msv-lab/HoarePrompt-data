#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and k is a list of n integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k` is a list of n integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list `k`, `numbers` is a list with at least n elements, `num` is the last element in the list `numbers`.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list `k`, where `k` is a list of `n` integers, and each integer `k_i` in the list satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list. The input list `numbers` is expected to contain at least one integer, and each integer in the list satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20. After the function concludes, the list `numbers` remains unchanged, and the returned value is the GCD of all elements in the list.
