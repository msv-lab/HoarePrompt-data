Output State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is an input integer, `result` is a list containing the number of screens required for each iteration of the loop, where the number of screens required for each iteration is calculated as follows: If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`, and if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`. The remaining cells on the screen are calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`. If `space_x` (which is `x`) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, the number of screens required for that iteration is `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, the number of screens required is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is `x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0` or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the variables `x` and `y` will still be non-negative integers within the range 0 to 99. The variable `n` will remain the same as the input integer. The `result` list will contain the number of screens required for each iteration, calculated based on the values of `x` and `y` provided as input during each iteration. The number of screens required for each iteration is determined by the logic inside the loop, which checks if the space required for `x` can fit into the remaining cells on the screens allocated for `y`. If it can, the number of screens required is simply the number of screens needed for `y`. If it cannot, additional screens are calculated based on the extra space needed for `x`.
