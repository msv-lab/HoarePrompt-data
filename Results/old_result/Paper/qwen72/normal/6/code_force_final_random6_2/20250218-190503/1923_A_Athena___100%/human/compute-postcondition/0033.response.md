Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is the last index of the list `a`, and `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.**

The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` changes the value of `a` to a list of integers provided by the user. The other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `a` is a list of integers, and `i` is still the last index of this list, while `res` still represents the number of zeros in the list `a`.
