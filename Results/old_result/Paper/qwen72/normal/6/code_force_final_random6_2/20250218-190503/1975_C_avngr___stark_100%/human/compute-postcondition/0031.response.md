Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 2 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `n-3`, `max` is the maximum value among the second largest elements of all possible sorted sublists of length 3 in `a`, and `_` is less than `t`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
