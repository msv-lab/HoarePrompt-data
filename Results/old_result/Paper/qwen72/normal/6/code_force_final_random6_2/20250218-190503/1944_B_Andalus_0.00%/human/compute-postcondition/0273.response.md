Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `rdb` now contains the second element of `rgt`. If the second element of `rgt` was equal to the first element of `rgt`, `rdb` now contains the first element of `rgt` as well. Otherwise, `rdb` remains unchanged except for the addition of the second element of `rgt`.**
