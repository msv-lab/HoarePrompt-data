Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 0, `c` is 1, `a` is now equal to `l[0]`, `b` retains its original value of `float('inf')`. The first element of `l` (i.e., `l[0]`) is greater than the previous value of `a`, and the element at index `x` in `l` (i.e., `l[x]`) is greater than `b`.**
