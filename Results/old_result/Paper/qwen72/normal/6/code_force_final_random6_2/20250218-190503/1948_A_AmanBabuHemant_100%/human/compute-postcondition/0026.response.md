The code snippet `s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)` assigns the value of the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times to the variable `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 48, inclusive, and is greater than 0.
- If `n` is odd, `n` is the input integer and `s` is not defined.
- If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is `n // 2 * 3`.
- If `n // 2 * 3` is less than 200, the length of `s` is less than 200.
- Otherwise, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200.

The code snippet `s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)` will update the value of `s` to be the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times. This means:
- If `n` is even, `s` will be defined as a string consisting of `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.
- The length of `s` will be `n // 2 * 3`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 48, inclusive, and is greater than 0.
- If `n` is odd, `n` is the input integer and `s` is not defined.
- If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is `n // 2 * 3`.
- If `n // 2 * 3` is less than 200, the length of `s` is less than 200.
- Otherwise, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 48, inclusive, and is greater than 0. If `n` is odd, `n` is the input integer and `s` is not defined. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is `n // 2 * 3`. If `n // 2 * 3` is less than 200, the length of `s` is less than 200. Otherwise, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200.**
