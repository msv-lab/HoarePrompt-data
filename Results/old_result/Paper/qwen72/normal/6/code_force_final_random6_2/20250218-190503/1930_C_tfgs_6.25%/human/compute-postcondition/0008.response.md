Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `i` is `n-1`, `a[0]` is increased by 1, `a[1]` is increased by 2, ..., `a[n-1]` is increased by `n`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 10^4. The variable `n` also remains unchanged as the integer provided by the user, representing the length of the list `a`. Each element in the list `a` has been incremented by a value that corresponds to its index plus one. Specifically, `a[0]` is increased by 1, `a[1]` is increased by 2, and so on, up to `a[n-1]` which is increased by `n`. The loop counter `i` will be equal to `n-1` after the final iteration.
