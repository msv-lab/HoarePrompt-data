The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `sng`. If `sng` has elements, the loop will continue to execute. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` must have at least one element, and `sz` (the size of `sng`) is now `sz + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still have at least one element left to iterate over. Since `sz` is now `sz + 1`, and the loop continues if `sz` is less than `k`, we need to ensure that `sng` still has elements to iterate over.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `sng` must have at least one element.
- `sz` is now `sz + 1`, but this is not directly part of the loop head, so we don't need to adjust it in the state.
- `elem` will be the next element in `sng`.

State: **`sng` must have at least one element, `elem` is the next element in `sng`**
