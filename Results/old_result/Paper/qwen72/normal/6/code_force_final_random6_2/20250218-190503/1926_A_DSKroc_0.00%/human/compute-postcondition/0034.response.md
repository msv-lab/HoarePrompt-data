The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the second character of `s`, and `s` must have at least two characters. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least three characters, and `i` will be the third character of `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is 1, `s` is an input string that must have at least three characters, and `i` is the third character of `s`. If `i` is 'A', `ac` is 2 and `bc` is 0. Otherwise, `ac` is 0 and `bc` is 2.**
