The function `func` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x ≠ y. The function returns a value based on the relationship between `x` and `y`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y` (where 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x ≠ y) and returns a value based on the relationship between `x` and `y`.**
