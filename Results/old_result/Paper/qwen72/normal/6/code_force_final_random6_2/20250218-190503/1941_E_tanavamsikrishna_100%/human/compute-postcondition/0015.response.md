To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

The loop condition is:
```
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
```
This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as the index of the element popped from the `min_heap` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

Given the current state:
- `row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0] = 1`, `row[-1] = 0`, and for each index `i` in the range `1` to `d-1`, `row[i]` is `row[i] + 2 * (d-1)`.
- `d` is a positive integer such that `1 <= d < len(row)`.
- `i` is `d`.
- `min_heap` is a heapified list of tuples containing the elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`.
- The loop cannot execute in its current form.

Let's break down the loop condition:
1. `(e := heappop(min_heap))` pops the smallest element from the heap, and `e` is a tuple where `e[0]` is the element and `e[1]` is the index.
2. The loop will execute if `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.

Given that `i` is `d`, the condition simplifies to:
- `e[1] <= d - (d + 2)`
- `e[1] <= -2`

Since `e[1]` is an index from the first `d` elements of `row`, and indices are non-negative, the condition `e[1] <= -2` will never be true. This is why the loop cannot execute in its current form.

To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that the condition can be true. The only way to do this is to adjust the value of `i` to be greater than `d` so that `i - (d + 2)` can be a non-negative number.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `i` must be greater than `d`.

Since `d` is a positive integer and `1 <= d < len(row)`, the smallest value `i` can be to satisfy the condition is `d + 3`.

State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0] = 1`, `row[-1] = 0`, and for each index `i` in the range `1` to `d-1`, `row[i]` is `row[i] + 2 * (d-1)`, `d` is a positive integer such that `1 <= d < len(row)`, `i` is `d + 3`, `min_heap` is a heapified list of tuples containing the elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`**.
