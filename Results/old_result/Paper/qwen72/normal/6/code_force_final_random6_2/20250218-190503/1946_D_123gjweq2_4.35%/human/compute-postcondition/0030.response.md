Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` that have a 0 at the `bit` position, `xor` is 0. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, then `thing1` is -1. Otherwise, if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, then `thing1` is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`. The bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0.**
