Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t < 1000\).
- `n` is the first integer read from the input line.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input line.
- The relationship between `n` and `k` is such that:
  - If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k`.
  - Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`, and the relationship between `n + 2` and `k * 2` is such that either:
    - `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, or
    - `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the integer `1`.
- The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
- The `print` statement will always print the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Output: **1**
