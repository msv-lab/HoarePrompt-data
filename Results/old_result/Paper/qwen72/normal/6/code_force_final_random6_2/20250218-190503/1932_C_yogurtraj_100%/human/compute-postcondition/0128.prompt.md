Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case: n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, s is a string of n characters, each character is either 'L' or 'R'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t = input()
    l = t.count('L')
    k = 0
    q1 = 0
    q2 = 0
    if t[-1] == 'L':
        k = a[l - 1] % m
        q1 = l - 2
        q2 = l
    else:
        k = a[l] % m
        q1 = l - 1
        q2 = l + 1
    y = [0] * n
    y[-1] = k
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if t[i] == 'R':
            k = k * a[q2] % m
            q2 += 1
        else:
            k = k * a[q1] % m
            q1 -= 1
        y[i] = k
    print(*y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has completed all iterations. `t` remains the input string, `ii` is 0, `n` and `m` are positive integers, `a` is the input list of integers, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `k` is the final value after all iterations, `q1` is the final value after all iterations, `q2` is the final value after all iterations, and `y` is a list of `n` elements where each element from index 0 to `n-2` is the updated value of `k` at each iteration, and the last element is the final value of `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has completed all iterations. `t` is the input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the value of `k` after the corresponding iteration of the loop, `i` is -1, `q1` is `l - 2 - (n - 1)` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `l - 1 - (n - 1)`, `q2` is `l + (n - 1)` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `l + 1 + (n - 1)`, and `k` is the final value of `k` after all iterations, which is the result of the series of multiplications and modulo operations as defined in the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop has completed all iterations. `t` is the input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in the input string `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the result of the loop's computation for that index, `i` is -1, `q1` is `l - n + 1` if the last character of `t` is 'L' or `l - n + 2` otherwise, `q2` is `l + n - 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L' or `l + n` otherwise, and `k` is the final computed value after all iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
