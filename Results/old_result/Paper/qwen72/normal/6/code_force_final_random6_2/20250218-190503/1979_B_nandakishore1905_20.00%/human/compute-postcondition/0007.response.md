The given Python code snippet is:
```python
print(1)
```

This code simply prints the integer `1`. The initial state provides information about variables `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the values of these variables do not affect the output of the code.

Output: **1**
