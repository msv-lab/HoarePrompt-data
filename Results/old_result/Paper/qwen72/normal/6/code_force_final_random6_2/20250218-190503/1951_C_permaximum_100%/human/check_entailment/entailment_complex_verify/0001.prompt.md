You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, the variables will have the following states: `total_cost` will be the sum of the costs of all tickets bought, `tickets_bought` will be equal to `k`, and `price_increase` will be equal to `k`. The heap `pq` will be empty or the remaining elements in `pq` will have prices that are higher than the prices of the tickets already bought.
    return total_cost
    #The program returns `total_cost`, which is the sum of the costs of all tickets bought.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. It returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, where the cost of each ticket is determined by the initial prices of `n` items, and the price of each item increases by the number of tickets bought so far. After the function concludes, `total_cost` will be the sum of the costs of all `k` tickets bought, and the heap `pq` will be empty or contain only items with prices higher than those of the tickets already bought.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of prices `prices`.

2. **Heap Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) `pq` with tuples of the form `(price, day)`, where `price` is the ticket price on a given day and `day` is the index of that day.
   - This ensures that the heap is sorted by the ticket prices, allowing us to always buy tickets from the cheapest available day.

3. **Heap Operations:**
   - The program uses a while loop to continue buying tickets until the total number of tickets bought equals `k`.
   - In each iteration, it pops the smallest price from the heap, which is the cheapest available day to buy tickets.
   - It then calculates the number of tickets to buy on that day, which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets that can be bought on a single day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program correctly updates the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets bought on the current day, which is `price * tickets_to_buy`.
   - It also updates the number of tickets bought and the price increase for subsequent days.

5. **Price Increase:**
   - The price increase is correctly calculated by adding the number of tickets bought on the current day to `price_increase`.
   - This ensures that the prices for subsequent days are adjusted correctly.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total cost for each test case, which is the result of the function `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints. It uses a priority queue to always buy the cheapest available tickets and adjusts the prices for subsequent days accordingly. The program handles all the given constraints and test cases correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
