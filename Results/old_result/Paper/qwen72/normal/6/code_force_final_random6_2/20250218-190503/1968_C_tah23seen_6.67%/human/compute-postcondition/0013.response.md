The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 500\). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be such that `i` is less than `n - 2`.

- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3 (since `i` is 1 and `n - 2` must be greater than `i`).

State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that \(1 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 500\) for all \(1 \leq i < n\), `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 500\), `ans` is a list of `n` integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`. If `ans[1]` is less than `arr[1]`, then `ans[1]` is updated to `arr[1]`. Otherwise, `ans[1]` remains `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`. The rest of the elements in `ans` are zeros, and `i` is 1.**
