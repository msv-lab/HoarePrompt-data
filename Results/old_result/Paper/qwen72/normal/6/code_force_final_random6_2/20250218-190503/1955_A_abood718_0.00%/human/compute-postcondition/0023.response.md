Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, `i` is 2, `A` is an integer input, `B` is an integer input, `C` is an integer input, and `int(input())` must be greater than 2.** 

The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are updated to the integer values provided by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged. The condition `int(input())` must be greater than 2 is still valid. The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` now hold the values input by the user.
