Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple and must have at least 3 tuples, `pos` is the first element of the third tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the third tuple in `monsters`, `bullets_used` is now equal to the second element of the first tuple in `monsters` plus the second element of the second tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is equal to `bullets_used + health`, `can_survive` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
