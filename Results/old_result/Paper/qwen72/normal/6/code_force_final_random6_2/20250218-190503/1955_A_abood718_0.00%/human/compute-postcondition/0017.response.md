Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `A` is an integer input, `B` is an integer input, `C` is an integer input, `X` is set to `A // 2` if `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is odd; otherwise, `X` remains undefined.**
