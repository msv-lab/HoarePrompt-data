You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        print(*res)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` is the length of an array and `k` is a parameter related to sorting cyclic shifts. The function then prints a list `res` based on the values of `n` and `k`: if `k` equals `n`, it prints a list of `n` ones; if `k` equals 1, it prints a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`; otherwise, it prints a list containing `-1`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, and `n`, `k`, and `res` holding the values of the last test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. This is done using `t = int(input())` and a loop `for _ in range(t)`.

2. **Case Handling**:
   - **Case 1: `k == n`**:
     - If `k` is equal to `n`, it means all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. The only way this can happen is if all elements in the array are the same. The program correctly handles this by creating an array of `n` elements, all set to `1` using `res = [1] * n`.
   - **Case 2: `k == 1`**:
     - If `k` is equal to `1`, it means exactly one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. One way to achieve this is to have an array where the elements are in strictly increasing order, and the first element is the smallest. The program correctly handles this by creating an array of `n` elements using `res = range(n)`, which generates a sequence from `0` to `n-1`.
   - **Case 3: `k != 1` and `k != n`**:
     - If `k` is neither `1` nor `n`, the program outputs `-1` using `res = [-1]`. This is because for `k` to be valid, the array must either have all elements the same (for `k == n`) or exactly one sorted cyclic shift (for `k == 1`). Any other value of `k` would not satisfy the conditions of the problem.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of each test case using `print(*res)`. This correctly unpacks the list `res` and prints its elements separated by spaces, which is the required format for the output.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `k` is `1` or `n` correctly.
   - For any other value of `k`, the program correctly outputs `-1`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle all the specified cases and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
