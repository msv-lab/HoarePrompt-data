You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate a series of operations on an array and then answer queries about the elements at specific positions in the array.
   - The operations are:
     - **Type 1:** Append an integer `x` to the array.
     - **Type 2:** Append `x` copies of the current array to itself.
   - The queries ask for the `k`-th element of the array after all operations are performed.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes `n` (number of operations), `operations` (list of operations), and `queries` (list of query positions).
     - It initializes an empty array `array` and an empty list `result` to store the answers to the queries.
     - It iterates through each operation:
       - If the operation type is 1, it appends the value to the array.
       - If the operation type is 2, it appends `x` copies of the current array to itself.
     - After all operations, it processes each query by appending the element at position `(k - 1) % len(array)` to the `result` list.
     - Finally, it returns the `result` list.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the number of operations and queries.
     - It reads the operations and queries.
     - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints the results.

3. **Identifying Potential Issues:**
   - **Memory and Performance:**
     - The array can grow very large, especially with type 2 operations. For example, if `x` is large, the array can become impractically large to store in memory.
     - The current implementation of `func_1` does not handle this efficiently. It repeatedly extends the array, which can lead to significant memory usage and slow performance.

   - **Modulo Operation:**
     - The modulo operation `(k - 1) % len(array)` is used to handle the queries. However, this assumes that the array is cyclic, which is not necessarily true for all operations and queries.
     - For type 2 operations, the array is repeated `x` times, and the modulo operation should take into account the length of the array before the operation and the number of repetitions.

4. **Correctness Evaluation:**
   - The provided program will work correctly for small inputs and simple cases.
   - However, for large inputs and complex cases, the program will likely fail due to memory constraints and inefficiency in handling the array growth.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is not correct for all inputs as it does not efficiently handle the growth of the array and may run into memory issues or performance bottlenecks. A more efficient approach would be needed to handle large inputs, such as using a segment tree or a different data structure to manage the array and its repetitions.
