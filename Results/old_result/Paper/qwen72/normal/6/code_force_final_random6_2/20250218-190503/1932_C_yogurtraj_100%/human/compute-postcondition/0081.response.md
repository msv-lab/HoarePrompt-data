Output State: **`t` is the input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `k`, `i` is `n - 4`, `y[i]` is `k`, `q1` is `q1 - 1`, `q2` is either `l + 3` or `l` or `l + 1`, and `k` is either `k * a[l - 1] % m` or `k * a[l - 3] % m` or `k * a[l - 2] % m`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `q1` is decremented by 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
