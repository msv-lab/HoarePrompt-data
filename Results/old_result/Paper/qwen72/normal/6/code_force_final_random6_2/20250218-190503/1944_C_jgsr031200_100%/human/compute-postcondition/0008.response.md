Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, `n` is the length of `arr` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the frequency of the integer `i` in `arr`, `cou` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `cou` to 0. All other variables (`arr`, `n`, `freq`) remain unchanged and retain their initial properties and values.
