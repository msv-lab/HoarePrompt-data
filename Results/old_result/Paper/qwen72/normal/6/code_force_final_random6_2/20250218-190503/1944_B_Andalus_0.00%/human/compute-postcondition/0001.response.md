The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the integer `T`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will be incremented from 0 to `T-1` as the loop runs.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
