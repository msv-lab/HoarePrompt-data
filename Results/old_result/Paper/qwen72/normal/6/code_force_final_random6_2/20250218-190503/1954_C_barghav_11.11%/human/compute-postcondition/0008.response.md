Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of `x` and `y` is between 1 and 100 digits, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, and `i` is greater than or equal to `len(a) // 2`.**
