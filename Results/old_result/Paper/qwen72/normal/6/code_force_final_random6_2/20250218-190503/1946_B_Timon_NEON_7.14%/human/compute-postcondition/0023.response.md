Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and `arr` must have at least one element. `i` is 0. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is a list containing the first element of `arr` and the integer 0. Otherwise, `new_segment` remains false. `max_segment[0]` is now `max_segment[0] + arr[0]`.**
