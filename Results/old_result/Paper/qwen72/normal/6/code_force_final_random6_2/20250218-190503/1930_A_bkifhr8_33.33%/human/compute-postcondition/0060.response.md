Output State: **`i` is `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of the first two integers in `lst` for each iteration until `lst` has 2 or fewer elements, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string `l` by spaces, with elements removed in pairs until 2 or fewer elements remain, `ans_f` is a list that includes the final value of `ans`, `t` must be greater than `n * 2`, and `l` is an input string.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations:
- The loop counter `i` has reached `n * 2`.
- The variable `ans` contains the sum of the minimum values of the first two integers in `lst` for each iteration until `lst` has 2 or fewer elements left.
- The list `lst` has been reduced to 2 or fewer elements by removing the first and third elements in each iteration.
- The list `ans_f` now includes the final value of `ans`.
- The variables `n`, `t`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial values.
