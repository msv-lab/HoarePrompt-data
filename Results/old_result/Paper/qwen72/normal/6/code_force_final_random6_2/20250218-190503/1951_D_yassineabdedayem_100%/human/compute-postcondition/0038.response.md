Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where 0 < t < 1000.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input line.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input line.
- If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k`.
- If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`.
- If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides conditions for the values of `n` and `k`, but it does not specify any logic that would change the output of the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
- Regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`, the `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
