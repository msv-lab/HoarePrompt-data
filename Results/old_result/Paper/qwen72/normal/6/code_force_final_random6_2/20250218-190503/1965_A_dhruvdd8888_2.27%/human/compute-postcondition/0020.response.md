Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `i` is 1. If the difference between the second element and the first element of `nums` is 1, `cd` is set to 2. Otherwise, `cd` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
