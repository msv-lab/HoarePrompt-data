Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `l` is an input string.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the variable `l`, which is now assigned the value of an input string.
