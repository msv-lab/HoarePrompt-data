### Reasoning:

1. **Input Processing**:
   - The function `func` reads from a file descriptor `0`, which typically corresponds to standard input. It processes every second line starting from the third line (`[2::2]`), which aligns with the problem description where the first line is the number of test cases, and each subsequent test case is described on the next line.

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each line (test case), the function splits the line into tokens (integers) and calculates the difference between the total number of tokens and the number of unique tokens.
   - The expression `len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens})` does the following:
     - `tokens := line.split()` splits the line into a list of tokens and assigns it to the variable `tokens`.
     - `len(tokens)` gives the total number of tokens.
     - `len({*tokens})` converts the list of tokens into a set (removing duplicates) and gives the number of unique tokens.
     - The difference `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` is the number of duplicate tokens, which corresponds to the number of points you can score if you play optimally.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - The problem states that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. However, the function only calculates the number of duplicates in your hand, which is a valid approach to determine the maximum number of points you can score.
   - If you have a duplicate card, you can score a point by playing the second card after Nene has played the first one. The number of such duplicates is the maximum number of points you can score.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is the number of points you can score.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score by counting the number of duplicate cards in your hand. This is a valid and efficient approach to solving the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
