Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation:
- `n` remains greater than 2.
- `_` remains 2.
- `x` is now the integer value of `data[idx]`.
- `idx` is incremented by 2, so it is now `idx + 2`.
- `v[x]` is incremented by 1, where `x` is the new value assigned from `data[idx]`.
