#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, and 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9). prices is a list of n integers where 1 <= prices[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n.
def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    pq = [(price, i) for i, price in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        price += price_increase
        
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy

    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, the variables will have the following states: `total_cost` will be the sum of the costs of all tickets bought, `tickets_bought` will be equal to `k`, and `price_increase` will be equal to `k`. The heap `pq` will be empty or the remaining elements in `pq` will have prices that are higher than the prices of the tickets already bought.
    return total_cost
    #The program returns `total_cost`, which is the sum of the costs of all tickets bought.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. It returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, where the cost of each ticket is determined by the initial prices of `n` items, and the price of each item increases by the number of tickets bought so far. After the function concludes, `total_cost` will be the sum of the costs of all `k` tickets bought, and the heap `pq` will be empty or contain only items with prices higher than those of the tickets already bought.
