Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `n` is the last input integer, `values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `values` is an empty list, `sum_values` is a list of zeros with length `max(numbers) + 1` if `numbers` is not empty, otherwise `sum_values` is an empty list, `total` is 0, `i` is 1, `values[0]` is 0, `sum_values[0]` is 0, `values[1]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `values[i] = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to the element at index 1 in the `values` list. Since `i` is 1, `values[1]` is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
