Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`, `a` is a list of n integers, `b` is a list of n integers, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `x` is `min(a[i], b[i]) + min(a[i], b[i])`, `i` is `n - 3`**

Explanation: The value of `pergunta` is updated to the minimum of its original value and `x + a[i]`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `x`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The new value of `pergunta` depends on the specific values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` at the index `i = n - 3`.
