The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ t < 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, but it still needs to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 < t < 1000, `n` is the first integer read from the input line, and `k` is the second integer read from the input line. If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k`. If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`. If `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`, then `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.**
