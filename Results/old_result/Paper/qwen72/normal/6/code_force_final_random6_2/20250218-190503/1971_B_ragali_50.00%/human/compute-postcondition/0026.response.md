Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is the last character of `s`, `s` is the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed, and `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s`. If `len(a) > 1`, `newstr` is the concatenation of the second half of `s` (starting from the middle index) and the first half of `s` (up to the middle index), and `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s`. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, then `newstr` is not equal to `s`. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, then `isreverse` is either not equal to `s` or equal to `s`. If `len(a) == 1`, the set `a` contains exactly one unique character.***
