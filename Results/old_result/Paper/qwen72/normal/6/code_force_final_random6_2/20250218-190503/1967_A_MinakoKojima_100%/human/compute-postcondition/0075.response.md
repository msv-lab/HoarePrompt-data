To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head involves the following objects:
- `i`: The loop variable.
- `n`: The input integer that is greater than 0.

The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The loop variable `i` will start at 0 and iterate up to `n - 2`.

Now, let's consider the given state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `k` is an input integer that can be 0 or not 0.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0.
- `ans` is now the first element of the list `a`.
- `ans_list` is a list that now contains the value of `ans` as its last element.
- `res` is now `n - 1`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 1. The state of `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer that can be 0 or not 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `ans` is the first element of the list `a`, `ans_list` is a list that contains the value of `ans` as its last element, `res` is `n - 1`, `i` is 0**
