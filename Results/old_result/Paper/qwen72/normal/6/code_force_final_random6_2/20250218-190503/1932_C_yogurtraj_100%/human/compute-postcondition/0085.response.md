To determine what will be printed by the `print(*y)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is the input string.
   - `ii` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `m` is a positive integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`.
   - `y` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the value of `k` after the corresponding iteration of the loop.
   - `i` is -1.
   - `q1` is `l - 2 - (n - 1)` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `l - 1 - (n - 1)`.
   - `q2` is `l + (n - 1)` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `l + 1 + (n - 1)`.
   - `k` is the final value of `k` after all iterations, which is the result of a series of multiplications and modulo operations as defined in the loop.

2. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop has completed all iterations, so `y` contains the values of `k` after each iteration.
   - The exact values of `k` in each iteration depend on the operations performed within the loop, which are not provided in the initial state. However, we know that `y` is a list of `n` elements, and each element is the value of `k` after the corresponding iteration.

3. **Output of `print(*y)`:**
   - The `print(*y)` statement will print the elements of the list `y` separated by spaces.
   - Since `y` contains the values of `k` after each iteration, the output will be a sequence of these values.

Given the initial state, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **[k1] [k2] ... [kn] (where [k1], [k2], ..., [kn] are the values of `k` after each of the `n` iterations of the loop)**

This format indicates that the output will be a sequence of `n` values, each representing the value of `k` after the corresponding iteration of the loop. The exact numerical values of `k` are not provided, but they are the results of the operations performed within the loop.
