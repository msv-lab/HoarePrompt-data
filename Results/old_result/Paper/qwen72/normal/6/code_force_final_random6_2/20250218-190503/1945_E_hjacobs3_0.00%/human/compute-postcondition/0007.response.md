Output State: **`n` is equal to the length of the `array`, `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and all elements in `array` are distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`, and `array[mid]` is less than `find`.**

Explanation:
- `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, where `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
