To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` remains the same and must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`.
   - The current value of `t` is either greater than or equal to 2, or `cnt[i]` is 0.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `N` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is explicitly set to 0.
   - `cnt` is a dictionary or list that keeps track of the count of elements in the list `a`.
   - `a` is a list of elements, and `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented for each element `a[j]` in the list `a`.

3. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition `cnt[i]` is 0 implies that the count of the element at index `i` (which is 0) in the list `a` is 0.
   - The condition `t` is either greater than or equal to 2 is given, but it does not directly affect the value of `i`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`.
   - Since `i` is explicitly set to 0 in the initial state, the value of `i` is 0.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the value of `i` is 0. Therefore, the `print(i)` statement will print:

Output: **0**
