Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is 2, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` (unchanged), `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is the final value after processing all elements in `rdb` or until `sz` reaches `k`, `rdb` is an empty list, `ldb` is a list containing the second element of `lft` and the element at index `i` of `lft`, and `sng` remains an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ldb.append(lft[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `ldb`. Given that `i` is 2, the element at index 2 of `lft` is added to `ldb`. Since the initial state specifies that `ldb` contains the second element of `lft`, after the code execution, `ldb` will contain the second element of `lft` and the element at index 2 of `lft`. All other variables remain unchanged.
