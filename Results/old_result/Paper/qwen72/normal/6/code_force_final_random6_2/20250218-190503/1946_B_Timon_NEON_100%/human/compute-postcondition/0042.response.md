Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`, `segments_variants` is a list containing either `[0, 0, -1]` or `[arr[1], 1, 0]` depending on the values of `max_segment` and `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` now includes the new segment with the last element as `i - 1` (which is 1).**

Explanation:
- `arr` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains 2.
- `max_sum` remains -1.
- `max_segment` is updated to the value of `new_segment`.
- `segments_variants` still contains either `[0, 0, -1]` or `[arr[1], 1, 0]` depending on the values of `max_segment` and `new_segment`, and now includes the new segment with the last element as 1.
