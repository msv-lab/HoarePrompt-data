The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 2 elements, and `num` is the second element of `arr`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 3 elements. The next value of `num` will be the third element of `arr`.

State: **`test_cases` remains a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is a list containing one element, which is the value of `count`, `count` is the original value of `count` plus the value of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` plus the value of `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with the key `mod_x_key` and the value 2, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with the key `mod_y_key` and the value 2, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the value of `-num % x`, `mod_y` is the value of `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is the value of `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is the value of `num % y`.**
