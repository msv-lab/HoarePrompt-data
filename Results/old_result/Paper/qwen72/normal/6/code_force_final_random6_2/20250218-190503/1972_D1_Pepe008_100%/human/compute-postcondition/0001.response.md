The only objects in the loop head are the variables `t` and `T`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `t` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0**
