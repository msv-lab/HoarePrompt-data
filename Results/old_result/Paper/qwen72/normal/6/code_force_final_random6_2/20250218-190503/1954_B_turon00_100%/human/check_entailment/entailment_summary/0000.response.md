Reasoning:  
The program aims to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. However, the logic implemented in the program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement.

1. **Initialization and Test Case Loop**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
3. **Tracking Consecutive Elements**: The program initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array and `cnt` to count the number of consecutive elements equal to `tmp`.
4. **Finding Minimum Consecutive Elements**: It iterates through the array, updating `cnt` for consecutive elements equal to `tmp` and updating `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` whenever a different element is encountered.
5. **Final Check**: After the loop, it checks if `ans` is equal to `n` or if `n` is 1. If either condition is true, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

However, the logic has a critical flaw:
- **Consecutive Elements Check**: The program only checks for consecutive elements equal to the first element of the array. This is insufficient because the problem requires checking for any subarray where the operation can be applied, not just those starting from the first element.
- **Non-Beautiful Array Condition**: The program does not correctly identify when the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements. It should check if there are any elements that can be removed to break the beautiful property, which involves more than just consecutive elements of the first element.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Identify all possible subarrays where the operation can be applied.
- Determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the beautiful property.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
