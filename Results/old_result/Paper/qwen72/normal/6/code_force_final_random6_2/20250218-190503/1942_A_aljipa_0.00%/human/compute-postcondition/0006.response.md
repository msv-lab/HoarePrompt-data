Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k` equals `n`, `res` is a range from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, otherwise `res` is a list containing `-1`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `n, k = (int(i) for i in input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively.
- The value of `t` remains `t - 1`.
- The value of `res` is determined based on the new values of `n` and `k`:
  - If `k` equals `n`, `res` is a list of `n` ones.
  - If `k` equals 1, `res` is a range from 0 to `n-1`.
  - Otherwise, `res` is a list containing `-1`.
