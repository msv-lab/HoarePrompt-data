The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `q`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `q`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `q` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` 2, and `q` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input, `q` must be greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b` which is less than `c`. If `a < b < c` is not true, then the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` does not satisfy `a < b < c`. If `a < b > c` is true, then `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`. If `a < b > c` is false, then the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` does not satisfy `a < b > c`.**
