To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head: `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `test_cases`. The loop will execute if `test_cases` is not empty. The state of `results` is not relevant to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a`.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `results` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will be assigned the values from the first tuple in `test_cases` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list**
