Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 0, `max` is 0, `_` is less than `t` and incremented by 1, `temp` is a list containing the first three elements of `a`.**

Explanation:
- `temp` is assigned a slice of the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is 0) and ending at index `i + 3` (which is 3, but the end index is exclusive, so it includes elements at indices 0, 1, and 2).
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `max`, and `_` remain unchanged.
