Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Case `k == n`:**
   - The program correctly outputs an array of `1` repeated `n` times, which is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of this array are sorted.

2. **Case `k == 1`:**
   - The program outputs a range of numbers from `0` to `n-1` (i.e., `range(n)`). This is incorrect because the elements of the array should be between `1` and `10^9`, and the range starts from `0`. Additionally, the range `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` is not a valid solution because it does not ensure that exactly one cyclic shift is sorted.

3. **Case `k != 1` and `k != n`:**
   - The program outputs `-1` for all other cases, which is not always correct. For example, for `n = 4` and `k = 2`, a valid solution could be `[1, 2, 3, 1]` because it has exactly two sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2, 3]`.

### Correct Solution:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to handle the cases more carefully:

- **If `k == n`:** Output an array of `1` repeated `n` times.
- **If `k == 1`:** Output an array where the first element is `1` and the rest are distinct and in increasing order, but the last element is greater than the first element. For example, `[1, 2, 3, ..., n-1, n+1]`.
- **If `1 < k < n`:** Output an array where the first `k` elements are in increasing order and the remaining `n-k` elements are all the same and greater than the `k`-th element. For example, `[1, 2, 3, ..., k, k+1, k+1, ..., k+1]`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        if k == n:
            res = [1] * n
        elif k == 1:
            res = list(range(1, n)) + [n + 1]
        elif 1 < k < n:
            res = list(range(1, k + 1)) + [k + 1] * (n - k)
        else:
            res = [-1]
        print(*res)
```

This program correctly handles all the cases and ensures that the output array meets the problem requirements.
