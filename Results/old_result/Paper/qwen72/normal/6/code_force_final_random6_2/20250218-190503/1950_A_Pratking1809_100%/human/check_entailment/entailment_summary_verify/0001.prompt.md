You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `q` from user input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. It then checks the relationship between these integers and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `q` test cases have been processed, and the appropriate output has been printed for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `q` which represents the number of test cases. This is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that iterates `q` times, once for each test case. This is also correct.

3. **Reading Digits**: Inside the loop, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from a single line of input using `input().split()` and `map(int, ...)` to convert the input strings to integers. This is consistent with the problem description which states that each test case contains three digits separated by spaces.

4. **Condition Checking**:
   - **Stair Condition**: The program checks if `a < b < c`. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR". This correctly identifies a stair as per the problem description.
   - **Peak Condition**: The program checks if `a < b > c`. If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK". This correctly identifies a peak as per the problem description.
   - **Neither Condition**: If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "NONE". This correctly handles the case where the digits do not form a stair or a peak.

5. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case, either "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the conditions checked.

Given that the program follows the problem description and handles all the specified conditions correctly, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
