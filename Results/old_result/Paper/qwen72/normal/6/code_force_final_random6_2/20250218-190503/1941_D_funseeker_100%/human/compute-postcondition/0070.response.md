Output State: **`r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - len(ans) - 1`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is now equal to `temp`, and `temp` contains all the unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0', '1', or '?'. If `c` is not '0', '1', or '?', `temp` remains an empty set.**
