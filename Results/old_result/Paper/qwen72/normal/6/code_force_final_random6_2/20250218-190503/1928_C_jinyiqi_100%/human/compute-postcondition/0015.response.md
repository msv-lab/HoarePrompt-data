Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` is a list containing the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`.**

In natural language, after the loop finishes all its iterations, `output1` will contain all the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` will contain the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`. The loop iterates from 1 to the integer part of the square root of `x`, and for each iteration, if `x` is divisible by the current value of `i`, both `i` and `x / i` are added to `output1` and `output2` respectively.
