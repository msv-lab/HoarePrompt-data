Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, sorted in descending order.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `t` must still be greater than 0 (as it was initially), the loop counter `_` will be `t-1` (indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration), `n` will be the last input integer representing the number of books in the final test case, and `nums` will be the last list of integers provided by the user for the final test case, sorted in descending order.
