Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). If `n` is odd, the function prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating 'AAB' `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, the function prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, the function prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed and the appropriate output has been printed for each. **
