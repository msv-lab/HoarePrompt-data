The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0 after the decrease. Therefore, `t` must be at least 2 at the start of this iteration to ensure it remains greater than 0 after being decreased by 2.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, the current directory contains subfolders that can be represented as integers within the range [start, end], `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 2, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is a new input string. `t` must be at least 2 to ensure the loop can execute one more time.**
