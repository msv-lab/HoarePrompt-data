Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `x` is positive infinity, `y` is positive infinity, and `s` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are lists, `s` is 0, and `x` and `y` are updated based on the following conditions: If `x > y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `b` contains the first element of `lit`, `y` is set to `lit[i]`, and `x` remains the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty. If `x > y` and `lit[i] > x`, `b` includes `lit[i]`, `y` is set to `lit[i]`, and `x` remains the last element of `a` or positive infinity if `a` is empty. If `x > y` and `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`, `a` includes the first element of `lit`, `x` is set to `lit[0]`, and `y` remains the last element of `b` or positive infinity if `b` is empty. If `x ≤ y` and `x == y`, `a` contains the first element of `lit`, `x` is set to `lit[0]`, and `y` remains positive infinity if `b` is empty or the last element of `b`. If `x ≤ y` and `x < y` and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x ≤ y` and `x < y` and `x < lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, `a` includes `lit[0]` as its last element, and `x` is updated to `lit[0]`. If `x ≤ y` and `x < y` and `x < lit[i]` and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If none of these conditions are met, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are lists, `s` is 0. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity; otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of list `a`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity; otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of list `b`. If `x > y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]`, `lit[1]` is appended to `b` and `y` is set to `lit[1]`. If `x > y` and `lit[1]` is greater than `x`, `lit[1]` is appended to `b` and `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `x > y` and `lit[1]` is not greater than `x` but is greater than `y`, `lit[1]` is appended to `a` and `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If `x > y` and neither condition is met, the lists `a` and `b`, and the variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged. If `x ≤ y`, and `x` is equal to `y`, `lit[1]` is appended to `a` and `x` is set to `lit[1]`. If `x ≤ y` and `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]`, `lit[1]` is appended to `a` and `x` is set to `lit[1]`. If `x ≤ y` and `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is less than `lit[1]` and `lit[1]` is greater than `y`, `lit[1]` is appended to `a` and `x` is set to `lit[1]`. If `x ≤ y` and `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is less than `lit[1]` and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]` and `lit[1]` is greater than `x`, `lit[1]` is appended to `b` and `y` is set to `lit[1]`. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are lists, `s` is 0. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of list `b`. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of list `a`. If `x > y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]`, `lit[2]` is appended to `b`. If `lit[2]` is greater than `x` and less than `y`, `lit[2]` is appended to `b` and `y` is set to `lit[2]`. If `lit[2]` is less than or equal to `x` and greater than `y`, `lit[2]` is appended to `a`. If `x <= y` and `x == y`, `a` contains the element `lit[2]` appended to it, and `x` is set to the last element of the updated list `a`. If `x < y` and `x >= lit[2]`, `a` contains the element `lit[2]` appended to it, and `x` is set to the last element of the updated list `a`. If `x < y` and `x < lit[2]` and `lit[2] > y`, `a` contains the element `lit[2]` appended to it, and `x` is set to the last element of the updated list `a`. If `x < y` and `x < lit[2]` and `lit[2] <= y` and `lit[2] > x`, `b` contains the element `lit[2]` appended to it. If `x >= y`, the lists `a` and `b` and the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
