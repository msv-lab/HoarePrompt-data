Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first input integer greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `ans` is the first element of `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, `res` is `n - 1`, `ans_list` is a list that contains the updated value of `ans` as its last element, `i` is 0, and `dif` is the difference between the second and first elements of `a`, which is not 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
