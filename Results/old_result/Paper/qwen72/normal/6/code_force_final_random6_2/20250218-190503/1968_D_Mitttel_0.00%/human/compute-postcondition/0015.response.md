Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `index` is increased by `2 * n + 4`, `p` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n - n]` to `data[index - n - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index + n - n - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`.
- Initially, `index` is increased by `n + 4` due to the precondition.
- After executing `index += n`, `index` is further increased by `n`, making the total increase `2 * n + 4`.
- The list `p` starts from `data[index - n - n]` to `data[index - n - 1]` because `index` has been incremented by `n` again.
- The list `a` starts from `data[index - n]` to `data[index + n - n - 1]` due to the new value of `index`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`) remain unchanged.
