Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings from user input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to `a` and at least 1, `i` is 2, `x` is \(\frac{a - 2 \cdot 1}{2^2} + 1\), `suma` is \(a + 1\) if the conditions \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) are not both satisfied, otherwise `suma` is \(a + 2\).**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to \(\frac{a - 2 \cdot 1}{2^2} + 1\), which simplifies to \(\frac{a - 2}{4} + 1\).
- The conditions \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) are checked, but the value of `suma` remains \(a + 1\) unless both conditions are satisfied, in which case `suma` becomes \(a + 2\).
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `i`) retain their initial values.
