Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `index` is now `t * (2 * n + 4)`, `p` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n - n]` to `data[index - n - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`, and `results` now contains `t` elements, each being the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The loop counter `_` will be `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times.
- The variables `n`, `k`, `PB`, and `PS` will hold the values from the last iteration, which are the integer values of `data[index - 4]`, `data[index - 3]`, `data[index - 2]`, and `data[index - 1]` respectively.
- The `index` variable will have been incremented by `t * (2 * n + 4)`, reflecting the total number of elements processed in the `data` list over all iterations.
- The lists `p` and `a` will contain the last set of `n` integers read from `data` for the final iteration.
- The `results` list will contain `t` elements, each being the result of calling `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration of the loop.
