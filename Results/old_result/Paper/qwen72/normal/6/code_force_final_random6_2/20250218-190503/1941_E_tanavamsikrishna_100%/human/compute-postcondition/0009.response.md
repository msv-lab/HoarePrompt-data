Output State: **`n` must be greater than `k - 1`, `i` is 2, `total_costs` now includes the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`, the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1` of `costs`, and the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k` of `costs`, `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than or equal to 2.**

The code `total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))` appends the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k` of the `costs` list to the `total_costs` list. The initial state specifies that `total_costs` already includes the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1` of `costs`. After executing the code, `total_costs` now includes an additional element, which is the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k` of `costs`. The values of `n`, `i`, and the precondition `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than or equal to 2 remain unchanged.
