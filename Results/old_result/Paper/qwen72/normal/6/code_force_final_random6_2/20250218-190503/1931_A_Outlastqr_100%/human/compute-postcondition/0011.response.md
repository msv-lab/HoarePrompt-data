Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'**. 

The code snippet assigns the string 'aay' to the variable `word`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `word` and the unchanged values of the other variables.
