Output State: **`N` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 2, `cnt[a[2]]` is incremented by 1.** 

The initial state specifies that `N` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 2. After executing the code `cnt[a[i]] += 1`, the value of `cnt[a[2]]` is incremented by 1. The values of `N` and `i` remain unchanged.
