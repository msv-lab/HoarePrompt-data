Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, and `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(n):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    if l[x] <= a:
        a = l[x]
    elif l[x] <= b:
        b = l[x]
    else:
        a = l[x]
        c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 0, and `c` is 0. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[0]`, `b` remains `float('inf')`, and if `a` > `b`, then `a` is set to be equal to `b`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain `float('inf')`. If `l[0]` is greater than `a`, then if `l[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, `b` is updated to `l[0]` and `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `a` is updated to `l[0]`, `b` remains `float('inf')`, and `c` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 1, and `c` is 0. If `l[1]` ≤ `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[1]`, and if `a` > `b`, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `l[1]` > `a`, then `c` is 1, `a` is updated to `l[1]`, and if `a` > `b`, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 2, and `c` is 0. If `l[2]` is less than or equal to `a`, `a` is set to `l[2]`. If `a` > `b`, `a` and `b` have swapped their values; otherwise, `a` and `b` retain their original values. If `l[2]` is greater than `b`, `c` is 1, and `a` is set to `l[2]`. If `a` > `b`, `a` and `b` have swapped their values; otherwise, `a` and `b` retain their original values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
