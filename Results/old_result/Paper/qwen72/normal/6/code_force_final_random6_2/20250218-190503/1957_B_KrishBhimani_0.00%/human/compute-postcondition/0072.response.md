To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- _ is 1
- t is greater than 0
- l1 is a list of strings obtained from the input
- n is the integer value of the first element in l1
- k is 0
- k0 is the integer value of the second element in l1
- i is the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial k (which is 0)
- arr is a list of indices where the bits in the binary representation of the initial k are 1 (which is an empty list)
- ans is an empty list
- c is 0

The loop head is:
```
for i in arr:
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element. Since `arr` is initially an empty list, the loop will not execute unless `arr` is modified to contain at least one element.

However, the task specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted. The only object in the loop head is `arr`, and the variable `i` is the loop index, which will be set by the loop itself.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `arr` is not empty. Since `arr` is derived from the binary representation of `k`, and `k` is initially 0, `arr` will be empty. To make `arr` non-empty, `k` must be a positive integer with at least one bit set to 1.

Given that `k` is 0, we need to adjust `k` to a positive integer with at least one bit set to 1. For simplicity, let's set `k` to 1, which has a binary representation of `1` and thus `arr` will be `[0]`.

State: **`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in l1, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in l1, `i` is 1, `arr` is [0], `ans` is an empty list, `c` is 0**
