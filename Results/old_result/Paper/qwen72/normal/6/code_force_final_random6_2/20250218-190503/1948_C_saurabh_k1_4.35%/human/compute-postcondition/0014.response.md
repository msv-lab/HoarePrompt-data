Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
- The function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, each consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `a` is a list of characters read from input.
- `b` is a list of characters read from input.
- If the second-to-last character of `b` is '<', the condition is met. Otherwise, the second-to-last character of `b` is not '<'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains only a `print` statement that outputs the string 'Yes'.
- The initial state describes the conditions and variables but does not provide any logic that would change the output of the `print` statement.
- The condition "if the second-to-last character of `b` is '<', the condition is met. Otherwise, the second-to-last character of `b` is not '<'" is mentioned, but it does not affect the `print` statement in the given code snippet.

### Conclusion:
- The `print` statement will always output the string 'Yes' regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
