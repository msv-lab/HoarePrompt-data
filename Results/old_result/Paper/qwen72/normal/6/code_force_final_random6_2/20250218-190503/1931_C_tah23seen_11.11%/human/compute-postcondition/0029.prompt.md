Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop will terminate when `i` is greater than `j` or when `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`. If the loop completes without breaking, `i` will be equal to `j + 1` or `i` will be equal to `j` if the length of `arr` is odd. If the loop breaks, `i` and `j` will be at the positions where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`. The list `arr` remains unchanged. Additionally, `i` is less than or equal to `j`.
Code of the loop:
while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is increased by 1, `i` is less than or equal to `j`, `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i - 1]`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is increased by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `j`, `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `arr[i]`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is increased by 3, `i` is less than or equal to `j`, `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
