You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 20), a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 20), `i` is `n-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. If for any index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the program does not return 'YES'.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns 'YES' if, for any index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases.
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended `t` times, `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended `t` times and has been fully iterated, `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from user input, where 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three additional inputs: an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b`, all with leading and trailing whitespace removed. It then calls `func_1` with these inputs and appends the result to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list. The final state of the program is that `t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1` for each test case, and the list has been fully iterated and printed.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if the characters in the same position of strings `a` and `b` are different from the corresponding character in string `c`. However, it does not ensure that the characters in `a` and `b` match the template correctly, especially when the template should have uppercase letters.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```
In this case, the program will return "YES" because `a[0] != c[0]`, `a[1] != c[1]`, and `a[2] != c[2]`. However, there is no valid template that can make both `a` and `b` match while `c` does not match. The correct output should be "NO".

To be correct, the program should ensure that for each position `i`:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `c[i]` must not be equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, and there must be a way to assign an uppercase letter to the template that satisfies the conditions.

The current implementation does not handle these conditions correctly.
