The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element. Given the initial state, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, and `n` is at least 2. Therefore, `arr` will always have at least one element, ensuring the loop can execute.

However, we need to specify the initial state of `num` for the first iteration of the loop. Since `num` will take the value of the first element in `arr` during the first iteration, we need to adjust the state to reflect this.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element in `arr`**
