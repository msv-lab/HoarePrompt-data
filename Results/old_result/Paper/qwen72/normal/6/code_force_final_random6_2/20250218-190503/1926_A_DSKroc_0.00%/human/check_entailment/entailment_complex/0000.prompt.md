Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to process a series of test cases. Each test case contains a string of length 5, composed of the characters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B}. The input starts with an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32) indicating the number of test cases, and each of the following t lines contains a distinct string.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is `t-1`, `ac` is the number of 'A' characters in the last input string `s`, and `bc` is the number of non-'A' characters in the last input string `s`.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: B
    #State: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is `t-1`, `ac` is the number of 'A' characters in the last input string `s`, and `bc` is the number of non-'A' characters in the last input string `s`. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, if `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`, the program executes the else part.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) indicating the number of test cases, and then reads `t` distinct strings of length 5, each composed of the characters 'A' and 'B'. For the last test case, it counts the number of 'A' and 'B' characters in the string. If the number of 'A' characters is greater than the number of 'B' characters, it prints 'A'. Otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value.
