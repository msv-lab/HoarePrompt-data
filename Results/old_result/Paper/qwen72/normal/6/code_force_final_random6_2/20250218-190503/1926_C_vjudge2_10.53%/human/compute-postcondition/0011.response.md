Output State: **`t` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `n` is the last input integer.**

Natural Language Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop has run `t` times, decrementing `t` each time by the range function (though `t` itself is not explicitly decremented in the loop, the loop runs `t` times). The list `numbers` will contain all the input integers that were provided during the loop execution, with the total number of elements in the list equal to the initial value of `t`. The variable `n` will hold the last input integer that was appended to the `numbers` list.
