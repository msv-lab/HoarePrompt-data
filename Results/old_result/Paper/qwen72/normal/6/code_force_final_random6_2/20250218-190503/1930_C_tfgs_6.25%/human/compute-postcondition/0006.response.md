The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer provided by the user and must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user and must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `i` is 2, `a[0]` is increased by 1, `a[1]` is increased by 2**
