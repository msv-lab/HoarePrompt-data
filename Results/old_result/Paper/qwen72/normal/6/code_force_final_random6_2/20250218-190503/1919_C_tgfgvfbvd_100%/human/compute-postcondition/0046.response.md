Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 0, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `c` is 0, and `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to the previous value of `a`.**

In natural language: The values of `a` and `b` have been swapped, so now `a` is `float('inf')` and `b` is `float('inf')`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `a` was greater than `b` is no longer valid, as both are now equal.
