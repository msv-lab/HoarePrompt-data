### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and must reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot moves every second in one of four directions: left, right, up, or down.
   - After the robot moves, it is forced to move in the direction of the arrow in the cell it lands on.
   - The grid is 2 rows by n columns, and n is always even.
   - The arrows are represented by '<' (left) and '>' (right).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - To reach cell (2, n), the robot must eventually move to the second row.
   - The robot can only move to the second row by moving down from the first row.
   - Once the robot is in the second row, it must move right to reach the last column (n).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two strings `a` and `b` representing the arrows in the first and second rows, respectively.
   - The program checks if the second-to-last character of the second row `b` is '<'.
   - If `b[n-2]` is '<', it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

4. **Critical Flaw**:
   - The program only checks the second-to-last character of the second row `b` to determine if the robot can reach cell (2, n).
   - This is insufficient because it does not consider the entire path the robot must take to reach (2, n).
   - For example, if the robot is forced to move left before reaching the second-to-last cell, it may never reach (2, n) even if `b[n-2]` is '>'.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - **Test Case 1**: `n = 4`, `a = ">><<", b = ">>><"`
     - The robot can move as follows: (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4).
     - The program correctly prints 'Yes'.
   - **Test Case 2**: `n = 2`, `a = "><", b = "><"`
     - The robot can move as follows: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2).
     - The program correctly prints 'Yes'.
   - **Test Case 3**: `n = 4`, `a = ">>><", b = ">><<"`
     - The robot cannot reach (2, 4) because it will be forced to move left before reaching the second-to-last cell.
     - The program incorrectly prints 'Yes' instead of 'No'.
   - **Test Case 4**: `n = 6`, `a = ">><<><", b = "><>>><"`
     - The robot can move as follows: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6).
     - The program correctly prints 'Yes'.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it only checks the second-to-last character of the second row `b` and does not consider the entire path the robot must take to reach cell (2, n).

**Correctness: False**
