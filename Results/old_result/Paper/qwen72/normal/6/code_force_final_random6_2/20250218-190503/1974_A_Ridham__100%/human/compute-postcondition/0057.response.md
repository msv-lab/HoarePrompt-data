To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to understand the structure of the `result` list based on the initial state and the conditions provided.

### Initial State:
- `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
- `n` is an input integer, which determines the number of iterations.
- `result` is a list that will contain the number of screens required for each iteration of the loop.

### Conditions for Each Iteration:
1. **Calculate `screen_require_for_y`**:
   - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is \( y // 2 \).
   - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is \( y // 2 + 1 \).

2. **Calculate `remaining_cells`**:
   - `remaining_cells` is calculated as \( 15 \times \text{screen_require_for_y} - y \times 4 \).

3. **Determine the number of screens required**:
   - If `space_x` (which is `x`) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, the number of screens required for that iteration is `screen_require_for_y`.
   - Otherwise, the number of screens required is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where:
     - `extra_space` is \( x - \text{remaining_cells} \).
     - `extra_screen` is \( \text{extra_space} // 15 \) if `extra_space % 15 == 0` or \( \text{extra_space} // 15 + 1 \) otherwise.

### Code Execution:
The `print` statement will print each element of the `result` list, separated by newlines.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **For each iteration**:
   - Calculate `screen_require_for_y` based on whether `y` is even or odd.
   - Calculate `remaining_cells` using the formula \( 15 \times \text{screen_require_for_y} - y \times 4 \).
   - Determine the number of screens required for that iteration based on the comparison between `x` and `remaining_cells`.

2. **Construct the `result` list**:
   - For each iteration, append the number of screens required to the `result` list.

3. **Print the `result` list**:
   - Convert each element of the `result` list to a string.
   - Join these strings with newlines.
   - Print the resulting string.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n = 3`, `x = 20`, and `y = 10` for the first iteration, `y = 15` for the second iteration, and `y = 20` for the third iteration.

- **First Iteration (y = 10)**:
  - `screen_require_for_y` = \( 10 // 2 = 5 \)
  - `remaining_cells` = \( 15 \times 5 - 10 \times 4 = 75 - 40 = 35 \)
  - Since `x = 20` and `20 <= 35`, the number of screens required is `5`.
  - `result.append(5)`

- **Second Iteration (y = 15)**:
  - `screen_require_for_y` = \( 15 // 2 + 1 = 8 \)
  - `remaining_cells` = \( 15 \times 8 - 15 \times 4 = 120 - 60 = 60 \)
  - Since `x = 20` and `20 <= 60`, the number of screens required is `8`.
  - `result.append(8)`

- **Third Iteration (y = 20)**:
  - `screen_require_for_y` = \( 20 // 2 = 10 \)
  - `remaining_cells` = \( 15 \times 10 - 20 \times 4 = 150 - 80 = 70 \)
  - Since `x = 20` and `20 <= 70`, the number of screens required is `10`.
  - `result.append(10)`

### Final `result` List:
- `result = [5, 8, 10]`

### Output:
The `print` statement will print each element of the `result` list, separated by newlines.

Output: **5
8
10**

This is the output based on the given initial state and the conditions for each iteration. The exact values in the `result` list will depend on the specific values of `x` and `y` for each iteration, but the format and structure of the output will always be as described.
