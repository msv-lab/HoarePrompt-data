You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` should take two parameters: `t` (an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `arrays` where each inner list represents a beautiful array `a` of integers. Each `a` has a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and contains integers `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arrays` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a beautiful array `a` of integers, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is False.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
        
    #State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arrays` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a beautiful array `a` of integers, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is False, `ans` is the minimum of the counts of consecutive elements equal to `val` before encountering a different element, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `val` at the end of the loop.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of arr before encountering a different element, updated to be the minimum of the previous ans and cnt)
    #State: *`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arrays` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a beautiful array `a` of integers, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `val` at the end of the loop, and `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`. If `flag` is True (all elements in `arr` are the same), `ans` remains the same as the count of consecutive elements equal to `val`. If `flag` is False (not all elements in `arr` are the same), `ans` is the minimum of the counts of consecutive elements equal to `val` before encountering a different element.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `arrays` where each inner list is a beautiful array of integers. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case in `arrays`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
