Output State: **The `test_cases` list must have at least 3 tuples, the `(n, x, y, arr)` tuple is the third tuple in `test_cases`, the `results` list now contains two elements, where the first element is the final value of `count` before the execution of the code, and the second element is the same final value of `count`. `count` is now 0. `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `mod_x_map`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new state of `mod_x_map`.
