Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` must be greater than 0, `s1` is an input string, `s2` is the new input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 0, and `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`. If `s1[0] == '1'` and `s2[0] == '0'`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus 1, and if `hd` > 0, `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1`. Otherwise, `res` remains the absolute value of `a1 - a2`.***
