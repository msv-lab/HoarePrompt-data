The code snippet `y = b[-1]` attempts to assign the last element of the list `b` to the variable `y`. However, the list `b` is not defined in the initial state, which means this operation will raise a `NameError` because `b` is not recognized.

Since the code raises an error, no changes are made to the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. If `lit` is an empty list, `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`.**
