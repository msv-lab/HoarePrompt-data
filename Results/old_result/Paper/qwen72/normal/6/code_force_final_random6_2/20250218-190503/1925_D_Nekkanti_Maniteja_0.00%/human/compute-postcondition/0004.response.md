Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `s` to 0. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, and `c` remain unchanged.
