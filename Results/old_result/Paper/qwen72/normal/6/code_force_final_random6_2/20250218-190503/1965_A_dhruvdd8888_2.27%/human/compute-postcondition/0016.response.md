Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `i` is 0. If the difference between the second element and the first element of `nums` is 1, then `cd` is 1. Otherwise, `cd` remains 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
