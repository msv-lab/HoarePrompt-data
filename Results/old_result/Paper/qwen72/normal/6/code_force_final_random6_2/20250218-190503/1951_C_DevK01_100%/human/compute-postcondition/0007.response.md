Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is `L[0]`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1] and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.**

Explanation:
- `q` is assigned the value of the ceiling of `k / m`.
- `k` is `L[2]` and `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
- The value of `q` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to the division of `L[2]` by the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
