Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values from the input, where `n` is the number of rows in the river grid, `m` is the number of columns, `k` is the number of bridges to build, and `d` is the maximum distance between supports. The values are such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m, with the first and last columns having a depth of 0. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers representing the depths of the river grid.**
