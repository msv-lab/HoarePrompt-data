Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed and must have at least two elements. `res` is 3 if both `a[i-1]` and `a[i]` are 0, otherwise `res` is 1 if `a[i-1]` is 0 and `a[i]` is not 0, and `res` remains 0 if `a[i-1]` is not 0. `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` must be less than the length of `a`. `_` is less than `t`, and `n` is an input integer.***
