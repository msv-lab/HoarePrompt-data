The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `int(input())` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `int(input())` must still be greater than 1 (since `i` is now 2).

State: **`int(input())` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are the integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers from the new input split by a space, `c` is the sum of the non-negative elements of `l` that are contiguous, `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and the current `c`**
