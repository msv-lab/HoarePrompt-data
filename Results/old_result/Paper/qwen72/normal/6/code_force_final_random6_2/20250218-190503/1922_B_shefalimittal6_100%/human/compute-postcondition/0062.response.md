Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by 1, `v[x]` is incremented by 2.**

Explanation: The code `v[x] += 1` increments the value of `v[x]` by 1. Since the initial state already mentions that `v[x]` is incremented by 1, after executing the code, `v[x]` is incremented by an additional 1, making it a total increment of 2. The other conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
