Precondition: **The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the binary string and possibly the number of test cases. A corrected function definition might look like: `def min_cost_sort(s, t=1):` where `s` is a binary string and `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5.**
