Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is the smallest integer in the list `l`, `b` is the second smallest integer in the list `l` (or `float('inf')` if there is no second smallest integer), and `c` is the count of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` remains the input integer greater than 0, representing the length of the list `l`.
- The variable `l` remains the list of integers input by the user.
- The variable `x` is now `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations.
- The variable `a` holds the smallest integer in the list `l`.
- The variable `b` holds the second smallest integer in the list `l`. If there is no second smallest integer (i.e., all elements in `l` are the same), `b` remains `float('inf')`.
- The variable `c` is the count of integers in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.
