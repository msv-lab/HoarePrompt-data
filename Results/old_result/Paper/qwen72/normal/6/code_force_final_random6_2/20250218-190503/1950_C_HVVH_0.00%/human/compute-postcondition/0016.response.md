Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `h` and `m` are integers representing the hour and minute from the input string in the format 'HH:MM', and `h` is not equal to 0. If `h` > 12, `h` is updated to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'AM'. Otherwise, `h` remains the same and `day` is 'PM'.***
