Reasoning:

The function `func` aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal by applying a single operation that assigns a value to a subarray. The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray.

1. **Initial Check for Uniform Array**:
   - The function first checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If so, it prints `0` because no operation is needed. This is correct.

2. **Handling Single Element Arrays**:
   - If the array has only one element (`n == 1`), it also prints `0` because a single element array is already uniform. This is correct.

3. **Counting Consecutive Identical Elements**:
   - The function then counts the maximum number of consecutive identical elements from the start (`cn`) and from the end (`ck`) of the array.
   - If the first and last elements are the same, it adds the counts from the start and end (`cn += ck`). This is because if the first and last elements are the same, we can potentially cover more elements in a single operation by combining the counts.

4. **Calculating the Minimum Cost**:
   - The function calculates the minimum cost as `n - max(cn, ck)`. This is the number of elements that need to be changed to make the array uniform. The idea is to find the longest segment of identical elements and then calculate the cost to change the rest of the array to match this segment.

However, there is a flaw in the logic:
- The function does not correctly handle cases where the array has multiple segments of identical elements that are not at the start or end. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`. The function will count `cn = 1` and `ck = 1`, and then add them together because `symb1 == symb2`, resulting in `cn = 2`. The output will be `5 - 2 = 3`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `2` because we can change the middle segment `[2, 2, 2]` to `1` or `1` to `2` with a cost of `3 - 1 = 2`.

To fix this, the function should:
- Find the longest segment of identical elements in the entire array, not just from the start or end.
- Calculate the cost based on the length of this longest segment.

Given the current implementation, the function is incorrect for some test cases.

Correctness: **False**
