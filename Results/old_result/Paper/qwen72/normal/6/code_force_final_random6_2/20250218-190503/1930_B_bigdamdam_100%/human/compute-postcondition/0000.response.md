The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the `range` function and will start at 0. The state of `n` is not directly relevant to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
