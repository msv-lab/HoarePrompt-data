Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is a constant and must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is initially set to 1.
   - `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`.
   - If `cnt[0]` is 1, then `t` is set to 2. Otherwise, `t` is set to 1.
   - If `cnt[i]` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `N` is a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `i` is initially 1.
   - `cnt` is a dictionary or list that keeps track of the counts of elements in `a`.
   - `a` is a list of elements, and `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented for each element in `a`.

3. **Execution of the Code:**
   - The code snippet provided is `print(i)`.
   - The value of `i` is initially set to 1.
   - The condition `if cnt[i] is 1` is checked, and if true, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - Since `i` is 1, the program will check `cnt[1]`.
   - If `cnt[1]` is 1, the program will break out of the loop, but this does not affect the value of `i` before the `print` statement.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
