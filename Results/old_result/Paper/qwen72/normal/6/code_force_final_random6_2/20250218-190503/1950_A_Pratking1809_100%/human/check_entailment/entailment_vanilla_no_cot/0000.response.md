Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a "STAIR," "PEAK," or "NONE" based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `q` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Condition Checking**:
   - For a "STAIR," it checks if `a < b < c`.
   - For a "PEAK," it checks if `a < b > c`.
   - If neither condition is satisfied, it prints "NONE".
3. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions.

The program handles all the cases as described in the problem and the example, so it is correct.
