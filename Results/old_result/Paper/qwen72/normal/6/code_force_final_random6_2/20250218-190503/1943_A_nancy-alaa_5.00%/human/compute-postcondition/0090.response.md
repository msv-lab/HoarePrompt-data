Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
   - `_` is 2.
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `first` is False.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly defined as 1 in the initial state.
   - The `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of `i`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `i` is 1, the print statement will output the integer 1.

Output: **1**
