You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
    if order == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `num2`. It checks if the first `num2 - 1` elements of the list `a` are in strictly increasing order. If they are, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input list `a` or the integer `num2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second element to the last element.
   - The beauty can be maximized by sorting the array in ascending order, as this will ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, and the sum of these differences will be maximized.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array `a` itself.
   - It then checks if the array is already in a non-decreasing order using the function `func_1`.
   - If the array is already in non-decreasing order, it prints `0` because no rearrangement can increase the beauty.
   - Otherwise, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` is in non-decreasing order.
   - It iterates through the array and counts the number of times an element is greater than or equal to the next element.
   - If the count `order` is `0`, it returns `True` (indicating the array is already in non-decreasing order).
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Beauty Calculation:**
   - If the array is not in non-decreasing order, the program sorts the array.
   - It then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - This approach is correct because sorting the array in ascending order will maximize the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the array is already in non-decreasing order by printing `0`.
   - It also handles the case where all elements are the same (e.g., `[69, 69, 69]`), which results in a beauty of `0`.

6. **Input and Output:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It prints the correct output for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the problem description accurately. It handles all edge cases and ensures the maximum beauty of the array is calculated correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
