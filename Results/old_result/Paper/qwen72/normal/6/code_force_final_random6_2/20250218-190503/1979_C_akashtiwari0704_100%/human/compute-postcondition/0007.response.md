The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the list `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the list `l`. If `i` is less than the length of `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `l` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `l` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**
