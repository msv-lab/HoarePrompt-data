Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers from the input split by a space, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0.**

The code snippet initializes the variable `maxi` to 0. The values of `int(input())`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition of `maxi` being set to 0.
