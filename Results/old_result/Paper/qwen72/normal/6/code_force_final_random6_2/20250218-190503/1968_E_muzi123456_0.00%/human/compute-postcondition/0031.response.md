The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer, which is greater than or equal to 2. The variable `i` was previously set to the value of `n`, but since `n` has been updated, `i` is no longer equal to the new value of `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 47, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the previous value of `n`**
