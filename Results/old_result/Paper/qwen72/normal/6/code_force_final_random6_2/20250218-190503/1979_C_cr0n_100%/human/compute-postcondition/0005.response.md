The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `vals`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `vals`. If `vals` has more elements, the loop will continue to execute.

At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is a list of N integers such that 2 ≤ `vals[i]` ≤ 20 for all 0 ≤ i < N, `den` is the result of `func_1(vals[0], vals[0])`, and `x` is the first element of `vals`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be the next element in `vals`. Since `x` is the first element of `vals` at the end of the last iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be the second element of `vals`.

State: **`N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is a list of N integers such that 2 ≤ `vals[i]` ≤ 20 for all 0 ≤ i < N, `den` is the result of `func_1(vals[0], vals[0])`, `x` is the second element of `vals`.**
