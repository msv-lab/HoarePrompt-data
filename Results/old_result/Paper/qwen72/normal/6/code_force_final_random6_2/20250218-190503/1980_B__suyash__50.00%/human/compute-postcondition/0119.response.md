Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order that must have at least 3 elements. `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[2]]`. If `fav` is not equal to `l[2]` and `k` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `fav` is equal to `l[2]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of the value of `k`.***
