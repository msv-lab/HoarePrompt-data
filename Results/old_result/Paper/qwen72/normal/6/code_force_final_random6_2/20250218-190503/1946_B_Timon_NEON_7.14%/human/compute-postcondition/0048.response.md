Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and `arr` must have at least three elements. `i` is 2. `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[2]`, and if `arr[2] < 0`, `max_segment[0]` is further updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[1]`. `new_segment` is either a list containing the second element of `arr` and the integer 1, or it remains an empty list. If `arr[2] >= 0`, `new_segment[0]` is updated to `new_segment[0] + arr[2]`. `segments_variants` remains unchanged.***
