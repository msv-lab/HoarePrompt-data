Correctness: **False**

The program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Initialization of `n` in the loop**: The variable `n` is used both to store the maximum number in the test cases and as the loop variable in the second loop. This can lead to incorrect behavior because `n` is overwritten in the loop.

2. **Efficiency**: The program iterates from 10 to `n + 1` for each test case, which is inefficient. Since `n` can be as large as \(2 \cdot 10^5\), this can lead to a time complexity of \(O(t \cdot n)\), which is too slow given the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

3. **Handling large `n` values**: The program should precompute the sum of digit sums for all possible values of `n` up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\) once, and then use these precomputed values to answer each test case in constant time.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

def precompute_sums(max_n):
    values = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    sum_values = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):
        values[i] = digit_sum(i)
        sum_values[i] = sum_values[i - 1] + values[i]
    return sum_values

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    max_n = 2 * 10**5
    sum_values = precompute_sums(max_n)
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print(sum_values[n])

func_1()
```

### Explanation:
1. **`digit_sum` function**: This function calculates the sum of the digits of a number `n`.
2. **`precompute_sums` function**: This function precomputes the sum of digit sums for all numbers from 1 to `max_n` and stores them in the `sum_values` list.
3. **`func_1` function**: This function reads the number of test cases `t` and the values of `n` for each test case. It then prints the precomputed sum for each `n`.

This approach ensures that the program runs efficiently within the given time limit.
