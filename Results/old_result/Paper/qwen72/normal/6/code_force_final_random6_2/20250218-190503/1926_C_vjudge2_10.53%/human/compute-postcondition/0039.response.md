Output State: **`total` is 45, `i` is 11, `n` must be greater than or equal to 11, `values` is a list of integers with the specified values, `sum_values` is a list of integers with the specified values, `word` is '11', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 1, `values[10]` is `values[0] + values[1]`, `values[11]` is `values[1] + values[1]`, `sum_values[10]` is `values[10] + sum_values[9]**

Explanation:
- `values[i]` is assigned the value `values[last] + values[remainder]`.
- `i` is 11, `last` is 1, and `remainder` is 1, so `values[11]` is set to `values[1] + values[1]`.
- The initial state specifies that `values[10]` is `values[0] + values[1]`, which remains unchanged.
- All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
