Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is `t-1`, `n` and `k` are input integers.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` (which represents the number of test cases) will be 0 because the loop has completed all the iterations it was supposed to do. The variable `i` will be `t-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`. The variables `n` and `k` will still be the input integers for the last test case processed by the loop.
