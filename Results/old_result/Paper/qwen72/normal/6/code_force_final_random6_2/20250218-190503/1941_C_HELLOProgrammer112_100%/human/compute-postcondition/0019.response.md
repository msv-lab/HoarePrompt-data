Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`, `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`**

Explanation:
- The code `z = s.count('mapie')` updates the value of `z` to the number of times the substring 'mapie' appears in the string `s`.
- The initial state specifies that `s` is a new input string, and `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`. After executing the code, `z` is correctly assigned the count of 'mapie' in `s`.
- The values of `int(input())`, `_`, `a`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this code snippet, so they remain the same as in the initial state.
