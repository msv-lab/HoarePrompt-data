Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 47.
- `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` is 3.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

The `print(i)` statement will print the value of the variable `i`. According to the initial state, `i` is explicitly defined as 3.

Output: **3**
