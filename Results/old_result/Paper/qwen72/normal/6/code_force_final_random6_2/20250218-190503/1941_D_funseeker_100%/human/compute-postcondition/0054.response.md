Output State: **`r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - len(ans) - 1`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` now contains the element `(q + r) % n`, and `c` is either '0' or '?'.**

Explanation:
- `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the result of `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
- The value of `r` remains the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace.
- The value of `c` remains the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, and it is either '0' or '?'.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `m` remains `m - len(ans) - 1`.
- `x` remains the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `ans` still must contain at least one element.
- `temp` now contains the element `(q + r) % n`.
