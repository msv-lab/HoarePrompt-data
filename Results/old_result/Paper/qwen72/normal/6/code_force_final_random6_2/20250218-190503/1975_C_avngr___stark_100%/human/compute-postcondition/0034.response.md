To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions provided:

### Loop Head Analysis:
- The loop head is: `for i in range(n - 2):`
- The variables in the loop head are: `i` and `n`.

### Conditions Provided:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500.
- `n` is an input integer where 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `i` is `n-3`.
- `max` is 0.
- `_` is less than `t`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Range Calculation**:
   - The loop will execute if `range(n - 2)` is not empty.
   - `range(n - 2)` is not empty if `n - 2` is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute.

2. **Initial Value of `i`**:
   - The loop variable `i` is initialized by the `range` function.
   - The initial value of `i` is 0, not `n-3`.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - `t`, `a`, `max`, and `_` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute.
- `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 0, `max` is 0, and `_` is less than `t`**
