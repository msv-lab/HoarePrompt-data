Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `ops` now includes the additional list `[r + 1, l + 1]` and `[r + 1, r + 1]`, `n` is equal to `l - r + 1`. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, the function may have performed some operation, but the exact changes are unknown. If the minimum value is not 0, no additional operations were performed.**
