The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the user input. The string `s` is expected to consist of characters "+" and "-", and `n` is the length of `s` with the constraint 1 <= n <= 5000. The function calculates the number of '-' characters in `s` and prints a value based on the following conditions: if the number of '-' characters is not equal to `n`, it prints `n - 2 * neg`; otherwise, it prints `n`. The function does not return any value.
