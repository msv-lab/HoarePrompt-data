Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 1 or 2, `r` is `n` - 1 or `n` - 2, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so if `l` was 0, it is now 1, and if `l` was 1, it is now 2.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]` is still valid, but now `l` has a new value.
- The updates to `k` and `a[l]` are still valid, as they were specified in the initial state.
- `sunks` is still incremented by 1, as it was in the initial state.
