Output State: **`t` is `t - 2` and must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing the input integers `n` and the new input integer `n`, `n` is the new input integer.**

The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the new input integer to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `numbers` is a list containing the input integers `n` and the new input integer `n`, which means the list will now contain two instances of the new input integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0 after subtracting 2.
