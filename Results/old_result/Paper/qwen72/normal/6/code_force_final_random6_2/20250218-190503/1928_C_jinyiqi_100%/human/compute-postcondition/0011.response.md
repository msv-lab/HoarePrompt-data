The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x` (i.e., `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`).

At the end of the last iteration:
- `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.
- `i` is 2.
- If `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), `output1` is a list containing [1, 2] and `output2` is a list containing [x, int(x / 2)].
- Otherwise, `output1` and `output2` remain empty lists.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `i` is 3, `output1` is a list containing [1, 2] if `x % 2 == 0` otherwise `output1` is an empty list, `output2` is a list containing [x, int(x / 2)] if `x % 2 == 0` otherwise `output2` is an empty list.**
