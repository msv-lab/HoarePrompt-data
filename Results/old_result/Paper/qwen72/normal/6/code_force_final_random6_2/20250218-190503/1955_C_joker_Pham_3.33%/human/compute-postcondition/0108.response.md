Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 1 or 2, `r` is `n` - 1, `n` - 2, or `n` - 3, with `a[l]` less than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- `l` is incremented by 1, so if `l` was 0, it is now 1, and if `l` was 1, it is now 2.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `r` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]` still holds.
- `sunks` is increased by 1, as stated in the initial state.
