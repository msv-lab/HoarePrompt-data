The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `vals`. The loop iterates over the list `vals`, and at the start of each iteration, `x` is set to the next element in `vals`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the second element of `vals`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be set to the next element in the list, which is the third element of `vals`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is a list of N integers such that 2 ≤ `vals[i]` ≤ 20 for all 0 ≤ i < N, `den` is the result of `func_1(den, vals[1])`, `x` is the third element of `vals`.**
