Let's break down the code step by step based on the initial state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
   - `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.
   - The file opened by `open(0)` must have at least 3 lines.
   - `line` is the third line of the file.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `line.split()`: This splits the third line of the file into a list of tokens based on whitespace. Let's denote this list as `tokens`.
   - `len(tokens)`: This gives the number of tokens in the list.
   - `{*tokens}`: This creates a set from the list of tokens, effectively removing any duplicate tokens.
   - `len({*tokens})`: This gives the number of unique tokens in the list.
   - `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})`: This calculates the difference between the total number of tokens and the number of unique tokens. This difference represents the number of duplicate tokens in the list.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the number of duplicate tokens in the third line of the file.

Since the exact content of the third line is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **number of duplicate tokens in the third line of the file** (where the third line of the file is split into tokens based on whitespace, and the number of duplicate tokens is the difference between the total number of tokens and the number of unique tokens).
