Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, `i` is `int(input()) - 1`, `A` is an integer input, `B` is an integer input, `C` is an integer input. If `B * 2 < C`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is even, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has completed all its iterations, the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The loop variable `i` will have reached the value `int(input()) - 1`, which means the loop has run for `int(input())` iterations. The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` will have their final values based on the last input provided during the last iteration of the loop.

- If `B * 2` is less than `C` during the last iteration, no additional changes are made to the variables.
- If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is even during the last iteration, no additional changes are made to the variables.
- If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is odd during the last iteration, the variable `X` is set to `A // 2`.

The loop will have printed the appropriate values based on the conditions for each iteration, but the final state of the variables will be as described above.
