Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer input by the user such that \(0 \leq t \leq 49\).
- `n` is an integer input by the user for the current test case and must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is explicitly set to 2.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly set to 2, the `print` statement will output the value of `i`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
