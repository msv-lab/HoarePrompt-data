### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they make the best possible moves to achieve their goals.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many small integers as possible in `c`.
   - To minimize the MEX, Bob should try to exclude as many small integers as possible from `c`.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - If an integer appears more than once in `a`, Alice can always include it in `c` because Bob can only remove one instance of it.
   - If an integer appears exactly once in `a`, Bob can remove it to prevent Alice from including it in `c`.
   - The game ends when all elements of `a` are removed, and the MEX of `c` is determined.

4. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program calculates the frequency of each integer in `a` using a frequency array `freq`.
   - It then iterates through the integers from 0 to `n` to determine the MEX.
   - If an integer appears at least twice, it is ignored because Alice can always include it.
   - If an integer appears exactly once, it is counted.
   - If two such integers are found (i.e., `cou == 2`), the current integer `i` is printed as the MEX and the loop breaks.
   - If an integer does not appear at all, it is printed as the MEX and the loop breaks.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the smallest integer that is not present in `c` by considering the frequency of each integer.
   - The condition `if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0` ensures that the MEX is correctly determined:
     - `cou == 2` means that two integers with a frequency of 1 have been found, which implies that the current integer `i` is the smallest integer that cannot be included in `c` because Bob can remove both of them.
     - `freq[i] == 0` means that the current integer `i` is not present in `a` at all, which is the smallest integer that cannot be included in `c`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where all integers in `a` are the same correctly.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **State Before Function Call:**
  - `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list.
  - The length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5).

- **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
  - **Frequency Calculation:**
    - `freq = [0] * (n + 1)` initializes a frequency array of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
    - The loop `for i in arr: freq[i] += 1` correctly updates the frequency array.

  - **MEX Determination:**
    - `cou = 0` initializes a counter to track the number of unique integers that appear exactly once.
    - The loop `for i in range(n + 1):` iterates through all possible integers from 0 to `n`.
    - `if freq[i] >= 2: continue` skips integers that appear more than once, as Alice can always include them.
    - `if freq[i] == 1: cou += 1` increments the counter for integers that appear exactly once.
    - `if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0: print(i); break` prints the MEX and breaks the loop:
      - `cou == 2` means two unique integers with a frequency of 1 have been found, and the current integer `i` is the MEX.
      - `freq[i] == 0` means the current integer `i` is not present in `arr`, and it is the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly determines the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal play of Alice and Bob. The algorithm accurately identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in `c` by considering the frequency of each integer in `a`. The conditions used in the loop ensure that the MEX is correctly determined in all scenarios.
