Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `index` is increased by 4.**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by 4.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, and `PS` remain the same, but their references in the `data` list are now shifted by 4 positions.
- `t` must still be greater than 0.
- `_` remains 0.
- `n` is now the integer value of `data[index - 4]`.
- `k` is now the integer value of `data[index - 3]`.
- `PB` is now the integer value of `data[index - 2]`.
- `PS` is now the integer value of `data[index - 1]`.
