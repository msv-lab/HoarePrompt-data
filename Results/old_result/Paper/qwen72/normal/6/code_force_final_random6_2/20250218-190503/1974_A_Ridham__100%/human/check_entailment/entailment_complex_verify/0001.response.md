### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total space required for the 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`).
   - It also calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`).
   - The total space required is the sum of `space_x` and `space_y`, but this sum is not directly used in the calculations.

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program determines the number of screens required to fit all the 2x2 icons. Since each screen can fit 2 of the 2x2 icons (each screen has 15 cells, and 2x2 icons take 4 cells each), the calculation is:
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` if `y` is even.
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.
   - This is correct because each screen can fit exactly 2 of the 2x2 icons, and if there is an odd number of 2x2 icons, one additional screen is needed.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the remaining cells on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons: `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
   - This is correct because each screen has 15 cells, and the total number of cells used by the 2x2 icons is `space_y`.

5. **Fitting 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program checks if the remaining cells are sufficient to fit all the 1x1 icons: `if space_x <= remaining_cells`.
   - If they are, it appends the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons to the result list.
   - If they are not, it calculates the additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells` calculates the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed.
     - `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + (extra_space % 15 > 0)` calculates the number of additional screens needed. This is correct because each screen can fit 15 1x1 icons, and if there are any remaining icons that don't fit into a full screen, one additional screen is needed.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case on a separate line, which matches the problem's output requirements.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initial State**:
  - The function `func` does not accept any parameters and reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
  - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`.

- **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
  - The calculation `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + (y % 2 > 0)` is correct. It ensures that if `y` is odd, one additional screen is required.

- **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
  - The calculation `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` is correct. It correctly computes the number of remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.

- **Fitting 1x1 Icons**:
  - The condition `if space_x <= remaining_cells` is correct. It checks if all 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining cells.
  - The calculation for additional screens `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + (extra_space % 15 > 0)` is correct. It ensures that if there are any remaining 1x1 icons that don't fit into a full screen, one additional screen is required.

- **Output**:
  - The program prints the results for each test case on a separate line, which is the correct format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, calculates the number of screens required for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons, and outputs the results in the expected format. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: True**
