Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and `arr` must have at least one element. `i` is 0. The condition `new_segment` is true. The current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0. Additionally, the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment`.**
