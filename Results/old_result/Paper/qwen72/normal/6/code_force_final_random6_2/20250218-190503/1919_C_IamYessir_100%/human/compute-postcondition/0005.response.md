The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0**
