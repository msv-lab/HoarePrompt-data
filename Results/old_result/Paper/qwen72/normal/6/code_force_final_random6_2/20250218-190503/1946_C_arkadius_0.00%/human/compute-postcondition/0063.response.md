Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `v` is the first element of the tuple popped from `stack`, and `stack` is a list with the last tuple removed. If `postorder` is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` has been fully processed, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to the sum of its original value and the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, plus the `good_components` of all other children, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to the sum of its original value and the `remaining_size` of all children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. If `postorder` is False, `stack` has the tuple `(v, True)` and `(u, False)` appended to it for each child `u` of `v`, and all children of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children` have been processed by the loop.***
