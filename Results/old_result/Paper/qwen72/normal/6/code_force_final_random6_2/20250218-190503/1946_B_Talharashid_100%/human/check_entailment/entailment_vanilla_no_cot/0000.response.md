Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program attempts to find the maximum subarray sum and then applies a formula to calculate the final result, but it does not correctly handle the operations as specified in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Subarray Sum**: The program attempts to find the maximum subarray sum by iterating through the array and resetting the sum when encountering a negative number. This approach does not correctly find the maximum subarray sum, especially in cases where the array contains both positive and negative numbers.

2. **Incorrect Formula for Final Result**: The formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is not correct for the problem. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The formula used does not reflect this process accurately.

3. **Handling of Empty Subarrays**: The problem allows for the selection of an empty subarray, which should not change the sum of the array. However, the program does not handle this case correctly.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The program correctly applies the modulo operation, but the formula used is incorrect, so the result is not valid.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to consider the following:

- **Maximum Subarray Sum**: Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum.
- **Sum of the Array**: Calculate the sum of the entire array.
- **Operations**: For each operation, the maximum possible increase in the sum of the array is the maximum subarray sum. Therefore, the final sum after `k` operations is the sum of the array plus `k` times the maximum subarray sum.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_subarray_sum(arr):
    max_current = max_global = arr[0]
    for num in arr[1:]:
        max_current = max(num, max_current + num)
        max_global = max(max_global, max_current)
    return max_global

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        total_sum = sum(l)
        max_sum = max_subarray_sum(l)
        result = (total_sum + k * max_sum) % 1000000007
        print(result)

func()
```

This program correctly finds the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm and then calculates the final sum after `k` operations by adding `k` times the maximum subarray sum to the total sum of the array. The result is then taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
