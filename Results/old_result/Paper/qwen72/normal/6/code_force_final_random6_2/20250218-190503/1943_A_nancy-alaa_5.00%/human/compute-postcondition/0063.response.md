Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
- `_` is 1.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- `i` is 2.
- `first` remains True or False based on the previous iteration's conditions.

The print statement is:
```
print(i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly defined as 2, the value of `i` that will be printed is 2.

Output: **2**
