Postcondition: ***`s` is a string with at least one character, `i` is the first character of `s`, `neg` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is equal to '-' or not, and `func_1(s, n)` is defined with parameters `s` and `n` where `1 <= n <= 5000`. If `i` is equal to '-', `neg` is set to 1. Otherwise, `neg` remains 0.***
