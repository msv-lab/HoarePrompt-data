Output State: **`n` is equal to the length of the `array`, `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and all elements in `array` are distinct integers from 1 to `n`. `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`. `mid` is now `(l + r) // 2`. If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, `l` is 0 and `r` is `(n - 1) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `l` is `mid + 1` and `r` is `n - 1`. `l` must be less than or equal to `r` for the loop to execute one more time.**
