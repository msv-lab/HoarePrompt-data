The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially equal to `n`, and `cnt` is 0. Since `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, the minimum value between `n` and 0 will always be 0. Therefore, `ans` is updated to 0.

Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, and the first element of `a` is not equal to `tmp`.**
