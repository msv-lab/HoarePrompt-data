Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer where 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 2, `_` is less than `t` and incremented by 1, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]`. If `temp[1]` is greater than the initial value of `max`, `max` is updated to `temp[1]`. Otherwise, `max` retains its initial value.**

Explanation:
- The code `temp = a[i:i + 3]` updates the value of `temp` to a new list containing the elements from index `2` to index `4` of the list `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `i` is 2, so `a[i:i + 3]` translates to `a[2:5]`, which includes the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]`.
- The rest of the initial state remains unchanged, including the conditions for `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `_`, and `max`.
