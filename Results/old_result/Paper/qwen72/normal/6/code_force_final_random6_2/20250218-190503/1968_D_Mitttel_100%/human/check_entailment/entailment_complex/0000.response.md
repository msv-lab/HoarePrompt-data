### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Adjustment:**
   - The program correctly parses the input values for `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - It adjusts the indices of the permutation `p` and the array `a` to be 0-based, which is necessary for Python's list indexing.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the game for a single player starting from a given position `s` for `k` turns.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score encountered.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current score.
   - It initializes `vis` to a list of zeros, which will be used to mark visited positions in the permutation.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs until either the current position `s` is revisited (i.e., `vis[s]` is 1) or `k` reaches 0.
   - Inside the loop:
     - It marks the current position `s` as visited.
     - It updates `mx` to be the maximum of the current `mx` and the potential score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining `k` turns.
     - It adds the score at the current position `a[s]` to `cur`.
     - It decrements `k` by 1.
     - It moves to the next position `p[s]`.

4. **Termination and Return:**
   - The loop terminates when either a position is revisited or `k` reaches 0.
   - The function returns the maximum score `mx` encountered during the loop.

5. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After computing the scores for both Bodya and Sasha using `func_1`, the program compares the scores and prints the result:
     - "Draw" if the scores are equal.
     - "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher.
     - "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Adjustment of `a` and `p`:**
  - The program incorrectly adjusts the values of `a` and `p` by subtracting 1 from each element. This is only necessary for the permutation `p` to convert it to 0-based indexing. The array `a` should not be adjusted in this way because it contains the scores, not indices.
  - **Correction Needed:** Remove the line `a[i] -= 1` from the input parsing section.

### Corrected Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1  # Convert permutation to 0-based index
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        
        cur += a[s]
        
        k -= 1
        
        s = p[s]
        
    return mx
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected as described above.
- **False** if the program is not corrected.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (due to the incorrect adjustment of `a` and `p`).

If the program is corrected as described, the correctness would be **True**.
