Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. This is done using `t = int(input())` and a loop `for _ in range(t)`. This part of the program is accurate.

2. **Case Handling**:
   - **Case 1: `k == n`**:
     - If `k` is equal to `n`, it means all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. The only way this can happen is if all elements in the array are the same. The program correctly handles this by creating an array of `n` elements, all set to `1` using `res = [1] * n`. This is correct.
   - **Case 2: `k == 1`**:
     - If `k` is equal to `1`, it means exactly one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. One way to achieve this is to have an array where the elements are in strictly increasing order, and the first element is the smallest. The program correctly handles this by creating an array of `n` elements using `res = range(n)`, which generates a sequence from `0` to `n-1`. This is correct.
   - **Case 3: `k != 1` and `k != n`**:
     - If `k` is neither `1` nor `n`, the program outputs `-1` using `res = [-1]`. This is based on the assumption that for `k` to be valid, the array must either have all elements the same (for `k == n`) or exactly one sorted cyclic shift (for `k == 1`). However, this assumption is incorrect. There are other valid configurations for `k` values between `1` and `n` that can satisfy the condition of having exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. For example, for `n = 4` and `k = 2`, the array `[1, 1, 2, 2]` has exactly two sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 1, 2, 2]` and `[2, 2, 1, 1]`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of each test case using `print(*res)`. This correctly unpacks the list `res` and prints its elements separated by spaces, which is the required format for the output. This part of the program is accurate.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `k` is `1` or `n` correctly.
   - However, the program incorrectly outputs `-1` for any other value of `k`, which is not always the correct behavior. There are valid configurations for `k` values between `1` and `n` that the program does not account for.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly handle all the specified cases and constraints, particularly for `k` values between `1` and `n`.

Final: **False**
