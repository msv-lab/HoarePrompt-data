Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` divided by 2, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing `[0, 1]` if `k` (after the update) is odd, or an empty list if `k` (after the update) is even, `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i` for each `i` in the original `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`. If `c` reaches `n - 1`, the last element of `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)`, and the loop breaks. `c` is equal to the number of elements in `ans`. `ans` is now padded with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.**
