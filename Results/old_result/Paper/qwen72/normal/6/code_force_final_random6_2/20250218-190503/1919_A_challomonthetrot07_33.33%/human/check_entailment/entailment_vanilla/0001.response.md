### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

2. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `a == b`**
     - If both players have the same number of coins, Bob will always win. This is because Alice will always be the first to make a move, and if both wallets have the same number of coins, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. Eventually, Alice will be the one who cannot make a move first.
   - **Case 2: `a == 1`**
     - If Alice has only 1 coin, she will lose because she cannot remove a coin without making her wallet empty, and Bob can always make a move.
   - **Case 3: `b == 1`**
     - If Bob has only 1 coin, Alice will win. Alice can swap wallets with Bob on her first move, and then Bob will be forced to remove a coin from his wallet, making it empty. Alice can then make a move, and Bob will be unable to make a move.
   - **Case 4: `a % 2 == 1`**
     - If Alice has an odd number of coins, Bob will win. This is because Alice will always be the one to make the last move that leaves an even number of coins, and Bob can then mirror Alice's moves until Alice is forced to make a move that leaves her wallet empty.
   - **Case 5: `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`**
     - If Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins, Alice will win. Alice can swap wallets with Bob, and then Bob will be forced to make a move with an even number of coins, which will eventually lead to Bob's wallet being empty.
   - **Case 6: `a > b`**
     - If Alice has more coins than Bob, Bob will win. This is because Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, and since Alice has more coins, she will be the one to make the last move that leaves her wallet with fewer coins than Bob's.
   - **Case 7: `a < b`**
     - If Alice has fewer coins than Bob, Alice will win. Alice can swap wallets with Bob, and then Bob will be forced to make a move with fewer coins, which will eventually lead to Bob's wallet being empty.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the cases where the number of coins in the wallets is the same, where one player has only 1 coin, and where the number of coins is odd or even.
- However, the logic for the cases where `a > b` and `a < b` is incorrect. The program assumes that if `a > b`, Bob will always win, and if `a < b`, Alice will always win. This is not always true. For example, if `a = 2` and `b = 3`, Alice can swap wallets with Bob and then win the game.
- The correct logic should be:
  - If `a` and `b` are both even, the player with the fewer coins will win.
  - If `a` and `b` are both odd, the player with the fewer coins will win.
  - If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice will win.
  - If `a` is odd and `b` is even, Bob will win.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the cases where `a` and `b` have different parities (odd/even) correctly.

**Correctness: False**
