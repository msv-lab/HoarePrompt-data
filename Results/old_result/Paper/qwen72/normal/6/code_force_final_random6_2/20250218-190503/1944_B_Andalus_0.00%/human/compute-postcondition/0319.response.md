Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, `sz` is 0, the program has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice, separated by spaces, followed by the elements from `sng` until `sz` reaches `k` or `sng` is exhausted.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `sz = 0` sets the variable `sz` to 0.
- The initial state variables `i`, `rdb`, and the printing behavior of `ldb` and `sng` remain unchanged.
- The previous value of `sz` (which was the minimum of `k` and `2 * len(ldb)` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`) is now overwritten with 0.
