Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit`, if `lit` is an empty list, `x` is positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`. If `b` was an empty list before, `y` is positive infinity. If `b` was not an empty list before, `y` is not modified.**
