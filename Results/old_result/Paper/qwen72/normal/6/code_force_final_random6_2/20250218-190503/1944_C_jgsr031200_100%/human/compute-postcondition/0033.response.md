Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list.
   - `n` is the length of `arr`, and it is given that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the frequency of the integer `i` in `arr`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - If `freq[i]` is 1, `cou` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2 in the initial state.
   - The `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of `i`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `i` is 2, the `print(i)` statement will print 2.

Output: **2**
