Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `_` is a placeholder variable (its value is not relevant to the problem).
   - `n` is the first integer read from the input line.
   - `k` is the second integer read from the input line.
   - `n` is not equal to `k`.
   - The current value of `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet simply prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides conditions that must be true before the code snippet is executed:
     - `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
     - `n` is not equal to `k`.
     - `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the initial state guarantees that `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition is always true.
   - Therefore, the code snippet will always print `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
