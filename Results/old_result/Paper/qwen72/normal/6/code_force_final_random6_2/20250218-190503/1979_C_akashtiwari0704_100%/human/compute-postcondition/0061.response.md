Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]` and `a[1]`, `a[1]` is updated to `prod // a[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[i]`, which is `a[1]` since `i` is 1.
- The value of `a[1]` is already updated to `prod // a[1]` as per the initial state.
- Therefore, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[1]`, which is `prod // a[1]`.
- The values of `bets`, `i`, `a[0]`, and `a[1]` remain as specified in the initial state.
