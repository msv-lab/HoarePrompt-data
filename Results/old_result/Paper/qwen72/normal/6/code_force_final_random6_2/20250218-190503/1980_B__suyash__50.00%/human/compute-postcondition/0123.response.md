The code snippet `b = list(map(int, a.split()))` converts the input string `a` into a list of integers, where each integer is derived from the substrings of `a` separated by whitespace. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `t`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`i` is the length of `l`, `k` is the initial `k` minus the sum of the counts of all strings in `l` that are not equal to `fav`, `t` is greater than the length of `l`, `b` is a list of integers derived from the substrings of `a` separated by whitespace.**
