Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `t`, `c`, `s`, `u`, `v`, `f` remain unchanged, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is updated to `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values input during the `m` iterations, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 0, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 1**

The value of `s` is updated to `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. The variable `i` is 1, and `c` is the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`. The value of `a` is the sum of all `f` values input during the `m` iterations. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
