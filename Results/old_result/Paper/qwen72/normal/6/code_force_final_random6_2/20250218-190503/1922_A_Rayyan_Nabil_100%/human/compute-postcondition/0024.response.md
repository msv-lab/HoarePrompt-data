Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(0 < t \leq 1000\).
   - `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended `t` times. This means `results` will have `t` elements.
   - `result` is the second element in the `results` list.
   - `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are string inputs by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(result)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `results` will have at least 2 elements.
   - The second element in the `results` list is assigned to `result`.
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the value of `result`, which is the second element in the `results` list.

4. **Precise Description:**
   - The value of `result` is the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for the second call in the loop that appends `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to `results` `t` times.
   - Since the exact inputs `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical or string value of `result`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will output the result of the second call to `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.

Output: **result (where result is the second element in the `results` list, which is the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for the second call in the loop)**
