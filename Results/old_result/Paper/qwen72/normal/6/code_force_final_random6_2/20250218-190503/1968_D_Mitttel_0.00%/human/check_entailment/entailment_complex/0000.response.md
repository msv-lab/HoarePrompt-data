Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` takes in the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
   - It calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').
   - The logic for comparing scores and determining the winner is straightforward and correct.

2. **Function 2 (`calculate_score`)**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position `start_pos`.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the game for `k` turns, updating the score and moving to the next position based on the permutation `p`.
   - It correctly handles cycles by detecting when a position is visited again and calculating the score for the remaining steps using the cycle length and cycle score.
   - The function returns the total score after `k` steps, which is correct.

3. **Function 3 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed one by one after all test cases are processed.
   - The function handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

**Potential Issues**:
- **Cycle Length Calculation**: The comment in `calculate_score` mentions that `cycle_length` is set to 0, but in the code, it is correctly calculated as `steps - cycle_start`. This is a minor discrepancy in the comments, but the actual code is correct.
- **Full Cycles Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the score for full cycles and the remaining steps within the cycle.
- **Input Parsing**: The input parsing in `func_2` is correct and follows the problem's input format.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for the permutation game as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
