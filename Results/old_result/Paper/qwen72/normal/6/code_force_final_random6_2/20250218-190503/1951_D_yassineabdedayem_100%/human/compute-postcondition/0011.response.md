Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `_` is a placeholder variable (not used in the print statement).
- `n` is the first integer read from the input line.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input line.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- The current value of `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Condition**:
   - The condition `n + 2 > k * 2` can be simplified to:
     \[
     n + 2 > 2k
     \]
     Subtract 2 from both sides:
     \[
     n > 2k - 2
     \]

2. **Expression in the Print Statement**:
   - The expression `n - k + 1` can be broken down as follows:
     \[
     n - k + 1
     \]

3. **Simplifying the Expression**:
   - Given the condition \( n > 2k - 2 \), we can infer that \( n \) is at least \( 2k - 1 \) (since \( n \) must be greater than \( 2k - 2 \)).
   - Therefore, the minimum value of \( n - k + 1 \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     (2k - 1) - k + 1 = k
     \]
   - This means \( n - k + 1 \) is at least \( k \).

4. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `n - k + 1` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Final Output:
The code prints the value of `n - k + 1`, which is at least \( k \) based on the given condition.
Output: **n - k + 1 (where n - k + 1 is at least k)**
