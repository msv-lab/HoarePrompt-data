Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers provided by the user input, `t` is an input positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000 and `t` must be greater than 1, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains two integers `b` and `x` with `b` in {1, 2} and 1 <= `x` <= `n` for `b`=1 and 1 <= `x` <= 10^9 for `b`=2, `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user input, where each integer `k_i` is such that 1 <= `k_i` <= min(10^18, `c`) and `c` is the size of the array after all operations, `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]` reads `n` lines of input, each line containing two integers, and stores them in the list `operations`.
- Each sublist in `operations` contains two integers `b` and `x`, where `b` is either 1 or 2, and `x` is within the specified ranges based on the value of `b`.
- The values of `n`, `q`, `t`, `queries`, `result`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `operations` is a list of `n` sublists, each containing two integers as described.
