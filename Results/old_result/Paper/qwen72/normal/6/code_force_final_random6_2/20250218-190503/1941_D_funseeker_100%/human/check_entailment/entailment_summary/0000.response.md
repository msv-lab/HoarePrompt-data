### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1` reads a line from the standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. This is used to read individual lines of input.
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` by calling `func_1` and converting the result to an integer.
   - `func_3` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts each part to an integer. This is used to read the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case.

2. **Main Logic in `func_4`:**
   - The function `func_4` processes each test case.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each of the `m` throws, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c` (or '?' if the direction is unknown).
   - It then updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after the throw. This is done by:
     - Adding `(q + r) % n` to `temp` if the direction is clockwise ('0') or unknown ('?').
     - Adding `(q - r) % n` to `temp` if the direction is counterclockwise ('1') or unknown ('?').
   - After processing all throws, it ensures that if `0` is in the set `ans`, it is replaced with `n` (since player 0 does not exist, and player `n` is the same as player 0 in a circular context).
   - Finally, it prints the number of possible players who could have the ball and the sorted list of these players.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly handles the circular nature of the game by using modulo operations.
   - It correctly accounts for unknown directions by considering both possible transitions.
   - The set `ans` is used to keep track of all possible positions, ensuring that duplicates are not added.
   - The final adjustment to replace `0` with `n` is necessary to match the problem's constraints where players are numbered from 1 to `n`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `c` is '?' by considering both directions.
   - It correctly handles the case where the ball could be with player `n` (which is the same as player 0 in a circular context).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.
