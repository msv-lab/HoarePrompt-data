Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is called with the variable `pergunta` set to `float('inf')` and is not properly utilized to track the minimum cost. Additionally, the logic inside `func_1` does not correctly account for the costs of moving Kirill to a position `j` and paying the necessary coins to people in between. Here is a potential case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
14
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will not produce the correct output because it does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position `j` and pay the necessary coins to people in between. The logic inside the loop is flawed, and the variable `pergunta` is not updated correctly to reflect the minimum cost.
