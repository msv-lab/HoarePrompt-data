Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 4, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (g / count + 1)`, `countmins` is 2, `g` is equal to `n / 3 - 2`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
