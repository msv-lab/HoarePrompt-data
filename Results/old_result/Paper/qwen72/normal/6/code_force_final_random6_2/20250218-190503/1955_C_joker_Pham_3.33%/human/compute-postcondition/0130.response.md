Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is 0, 1, or 2, `r` is `n` - 2, `n` - 3, or `n` - 4. If `k` >= `a[r] * 2`, `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`, `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, `sunks` is increased by 1, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `k` < `a[r] * 2` and `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement without changing `sunks`.***
