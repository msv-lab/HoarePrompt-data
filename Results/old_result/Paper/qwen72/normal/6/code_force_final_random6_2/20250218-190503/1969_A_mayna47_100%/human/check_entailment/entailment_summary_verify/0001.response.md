### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program reads the number of friends `n` and initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` with zeros.
   - It then updates `v` to include the input values, starting from index 1. This is necessary because the friends are indexed from 1 to `n`.

3. **Checking for Pairs**:
   - The program iterates over each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - It checks if `v[v[i]] == i`, which means that the best friend of `i`'s best friend is `i` itself. This indicates that `i` and `v[i]` form a pair of mutual best friends.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns immediately, as sending invitations to both friends in the pair will ensure that both come to the party.

4. **Default Case**:
   - If no such pair is found, the program prints `3`.
   - The reasoning here is that if there are no mutual best friend pairs, the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3. This is because inviting 3 friends will always ensure that at least 2 of them have their best friends also invited.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 2` correctly. In this case, the only possible input is `[2, 1]`, and the program will print `2` because the two friends are mutual best friends.
   - For larger `n`, the program correctly identifies mutual best friend pairs and prints `2` if such a pair exists. If no such pair exists, it prints `3`.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - It handles all given constraints and edge cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly identifies the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, and it handles all given constraints and edge cases correctly.

Final: **True**
