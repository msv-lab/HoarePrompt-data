Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is the last character of `s`, `s` is the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed and must not be empty, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s`. If `len(a) > 1`, then `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` (from the middle to the end) with the first half of `s` (from the start to the middle), and `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s`. If `len(a) == 1`, then `newstr` and `isreverse` remain as defined in the previous iteration.***
