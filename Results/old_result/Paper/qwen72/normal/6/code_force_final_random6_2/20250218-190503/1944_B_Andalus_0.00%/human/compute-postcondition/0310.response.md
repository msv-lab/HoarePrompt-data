Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index.
   - `sz` is the minimum of `k` and `2 * len(ldb)` plus 1.
   - The program has already printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice, separated by spaces.
   - `sng` is a non-empty iterable.
   - `elem` is the next element in `sng`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - `elem` is the next element in the iterable `sng`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `sng` is a non-empty iterable and `elem` is the next element in `sng`, the output will be the value of `elem` followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] (where [elem] is the next element in the iterable `sng`)**
