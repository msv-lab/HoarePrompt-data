Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program only checks and modifies the array once, which is insufficient for cases where multiple operations are required to sort the array. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle cases where the array cannot be sorted by the given operations. Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
NO
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
Yes
No
Yes
```

For the second test case `[12, 28, 5]`, the program outputs `No` because it only checks and modifies the array once. However, it is possible to sort the array by performing the operation multiple times. For example, splitting `28` into `2` and `8` and then splitting `12` into `1` and `2` can result in the sorted array `[1, 2, 2, 5, 8]`. The program fails to consider this possibility, leading to an incorrect output.
