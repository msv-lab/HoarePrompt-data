Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated to a new string input by the user, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- The values of `t`, `results`, `n`, `a`, and `c` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `b` is a string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, but the exact content of the string is not specified.
