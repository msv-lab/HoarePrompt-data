The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`, and the range parameters. The loop is iterating in reverse, starting from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), with a step of `-1`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` according to the loop's iteration mechanism.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` must be at least 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n - 2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

State: **`pergunta` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), `a` is a list of n integers, `b` is a list of n integers, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `x` is `min(a[i], b[i])`, `i` is `n - 2`**
