Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `t`, the loop has completed all iterations. For each of the `t` test cases, the variables `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`, and `cost` have been updated and printed according to the logic of the loop. The final `cost` for each test case has been calculated and printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the loop counter `_` will have reached the value of `t`, indicating that the loop has completed its execution. For each of the `t` test cases, the loop has processed the inputs `L` and `M`, calculated the necessary variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`, and `cost`), and printed the final `cost` for that test case. The values of `L` and `M` for each test case are provided by the user and are processed independently within each iteration of the loop. The loop does not affect the initial value of `t`, and the `continue` statement ensures that each iteration is completed before moving to the next one.
