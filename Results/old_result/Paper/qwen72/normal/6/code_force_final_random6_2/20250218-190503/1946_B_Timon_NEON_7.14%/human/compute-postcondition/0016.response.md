Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and `arr` must have at least one element. `i` is 0. `new_segment` is true. The first element of `arr` (i.e., `arr[0]`) is greater than or equal to 0. `max_segment[0]` is now equal to its previous value plus `arr[0]`.**
