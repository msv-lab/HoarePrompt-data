Reasoning:

The provided program and the original assessment are generally accurate, but there are a few points to consider to ensure the program is fully correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and processes them to update the number of available positions for placing rooks.

2. **Move Processing**:
   - The program correctly reduces `n` by 2 if `a != b` (since both `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are occupied by rooks).
   - It correctly reduces `n` by 1 if `a == b` (since only one position `(a, a)` is occupied by a rook).

3. **Dynamic Programming for Final Configurations**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `[1, 1]` to handle the base cases.
   - The loop iterates from 2 to `n`, updating the DP array based on the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`.
   - The result is returned as `dp[-1]`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the result of `func_1(n)`.

However, there is a minor issue in the original assessment:
- The dynamic programming formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)` is correct, but the modulo operation should be `10^9 + 7` (which is `1000000007`), not `7 + 10 ** 9` (which is `1000000007` as well, but the expression is misleading).

Given this, the program is still correct because the modulo operation is correctly implemented, but the expression in the assessment is misleading. This does not affect the correctness of the program's logic or its output.

Final: **True**

The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately. The dynamic programming approach is efficient and handles the constraints properly. The only issue is a minor misleading expression in the assessment, but the program itself is correct.
