The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element, and `i` must be set to the first element of `arr`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list.
- The length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5).
- `freq` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.

To ensure the loop executes, `arr` must have at least one element, and `i` must be the first element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list and must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `n` is the length of `arr` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `freq` is a list of `n + 1` zeros**
