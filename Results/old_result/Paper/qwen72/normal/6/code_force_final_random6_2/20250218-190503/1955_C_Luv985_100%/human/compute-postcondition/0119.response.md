Output State: **`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is greater than 0, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the update.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - mi`.
- The value of `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the update.
- The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` or `n - 3`, and `k` is greater than 0 still holds.
