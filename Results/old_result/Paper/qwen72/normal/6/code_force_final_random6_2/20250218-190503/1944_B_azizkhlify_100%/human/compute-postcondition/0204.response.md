To determine the required adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head: `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(n, 2 * n)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `res` is a non-empty list.
- `ul` and `ur` are not equal.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n + 1`.

The loop head is:
```
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`.
2. **Next Iteration of `i`**: In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `n + 2`.
3. **Range Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.

### Adjustments:
- **`i`**: Incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n + 2`.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified in the loop head or by the loop body (as per the given conditions).

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `2 * n`. Given that `i` is `n + 2` and `n` is greater than 0, the loop will continue to execute as long as `n + 2` is less than `2 * n`.

State: **`res` is a non-empty list, `ul` and `ur` are not equal, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is `n + 2`**
