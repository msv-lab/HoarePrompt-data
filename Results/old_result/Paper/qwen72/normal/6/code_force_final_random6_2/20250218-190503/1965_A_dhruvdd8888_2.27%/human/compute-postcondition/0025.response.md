Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `i` is the index of the last element in `nums` that was checked before the loop terminated. If all consecutive elements from `nums[1]` to `nums[len(nums) - 2]` have a difference of 1, then `cd` is `len(nums) - 3`. Otherwise, `cd` is the number of consecutive elements starting from `nums[1]` that have a difference of 1 before the first non-consecutive pair is found.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the elements of `nums` from index 0 to `len(nums) - 3`.
- For each iteration, it checks if the difference between `nums[i + 1]` and `nums[i]` is 1.
- If the difference is 1, it increments `cd` by 1.
- If the difference is not 1, the loop breaks.
- After all iterations, `i` will be the index of the last element checked before the loop terminated.
- `cd` will be the number of consecutive elements starting from `nums[1]` that have a difference of 1 before the first non-consecutive pair is found, or `len(nums) - 3` if all elements are consecutive.
