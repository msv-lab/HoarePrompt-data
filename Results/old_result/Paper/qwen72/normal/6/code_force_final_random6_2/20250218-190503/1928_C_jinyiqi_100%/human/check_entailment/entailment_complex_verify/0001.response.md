### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem describes a pattern in which students are assigned numbers in a line. The pattern repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - For a given position \(n\) and number \(x\), we need to determine how many different values of \(k\) fit the constraints.

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The pattern for the first \(k\) positions is \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, k\).
   - The pattern for the next \(k - 2\) positions is \(k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2\).
   - This pattern repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.

3. **Constraints:**
   - \(k > 1\)
   - \(1 \le x < n \le 10^9\)

4. **Key Observations:**
   - For a given \(n\) and \(x\), \(k\) must be such that \(n\) falls into one of the repeating segments.
   - The position \(n\) can be either in the increasing segment or the decreasing segment.
   - The increasing segment starts at position 1 and ends at position \(k\).
   - The decreasing segment starts at position \(k + 1\) and ends at position \(2k - 2\).

5. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - If \(n\) is in the increasing segment, then \(n \mod (2k - 2) \le k\).
   - If \(n\) is in the decreasing segment, then \(n \mod (2k - 2) > k\) and \(n \mod (2k - 2) \le 2k - 2\).

6. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to find all divisors of a given number.
   - It then checks if the divisors fit the constraints for \(k\).

7. **Program Breakdown:**
   - **Input Reading:**
     - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
     - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(x\).

   - **Divisor Calculation:**
     - `func_1` calculates all divisors of a given number \(x\).
     - It returns a list of divisors in descending order.

   - **Condition Checking:**
     - The program checks if \((n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0\) and \((n - x) \% 2 == 0\).
     - For each condition, it finds the divisors of the respective number and checks if they fit the constraints for \(k\).

   - **Valid \(k\) Calculation:**
     - The program correctly checks if the divisors fit the constraints for \(k\) by ensuring \((s + 2) \% 2 == 0\) and \((s + 2) / 2 \ge x\).

8. **Correctness Verification:**
   - **Divisor Calculation:**
     - `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of a number and returns them in descending order.
   - **Condition Checking:**
     - The conditions \((n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0\) and \((n - x) \% 2 == 0\) are necessary to ensure that \(n\) and \(x\) fit into the pattern.
     - These conditions are derived from the fact that the pattern repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions, and the modulo operation helps in identifying the segment.
   - **Valid \(k\) Calculation:**
     - The program correctly checks if the divisors fit the constraints for \(k\) by ensuring \((s + 2) \% 2 == 0\) and \((s + 2) / 2 \ge x\).
     - The use of \((s + 2) / 2\) ensures that the \(k\) values are natural numbers greater than 1.

9. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where \(k = 1\) is not valid.
   - It also handles the constraints \(1 \le x < n \le 10^9\).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the number of valid \(k\) values based on the given constraints. The divisor calculation and condition checking are appropriate for the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
