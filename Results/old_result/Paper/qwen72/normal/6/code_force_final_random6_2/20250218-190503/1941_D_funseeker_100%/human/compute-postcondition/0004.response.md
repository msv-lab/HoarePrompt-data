Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace.**

Explanation:
- The code `r = int(r)` converts the variable `r` from a string to an integer.
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain as they were returned by `func_3()`.
- The set `ans` still contains the value of `x`.
- The condition that `m` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
- The variable `c` remains the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace.
