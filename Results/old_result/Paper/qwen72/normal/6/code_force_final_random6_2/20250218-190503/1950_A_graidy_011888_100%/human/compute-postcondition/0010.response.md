Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `a < b` and `b > c`, then the condition `a < b and b > c` is true. Otherwise, the condition `a < b < c` is not true, and the condition `a < b and b > c` is also not true.***
