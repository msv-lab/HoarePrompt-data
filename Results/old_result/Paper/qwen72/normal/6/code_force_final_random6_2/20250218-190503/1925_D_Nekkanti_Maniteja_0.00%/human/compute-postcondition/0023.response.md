To determine what will be printed by the `print(s % M)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\).
   - `i` is `k - 1`.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user.
   - `M` is \(1000000007\).
   - `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \times (n - 1) \div 1\) modulo \(M\).
   - `s` is updated to \(s + c \times (0 \times m + 1 \times m + 2 \times m + \ldots + (k-1) \times m) + c \times a \times k\).
   - `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the user over `m` iterations.
   - `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated with the final values provided by the user in the last iteration.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` and `m` are user-provided integers.
   - `k` is another user-provided integer, and `i` is `k - 1`.
   - `M` is a constant \(1000000007\).
   - `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \times (n - 1)\) modulo \(M\). This means \(c\) is the integer such that \((n \times (n - 1) \times c) \equiv 1 \pmod{M}\).
   - `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the user over `m` iterations.
   - The expression \(0 \times m + 1 \times m + 2 \times m + \ldots + (k-1) \times m\) can be simplified to \(m \times (0 + 1 + 2 + \ldots + (k-1))\). The sum of the first \(k-1\) integers is \(\frac{(k-1) \times k}{2}\). Therefore, the expression becomes \(m \times \frac{(k-1) \times k}{2}\).

3. **Updating `s`:**
   - The update to `s` is given by:
     \[
     s = s + c \times \left(m \times \frac{(k-1) \times k}{2}\right) + c \times a \times k
     \]
   - Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
     \[
     s = s + c \times \left(\frac{m \times (k-1) \times k}{2}\right) + c \times a \times k
     \]
   - Combining the terms:
     \[
     s = s + c \times \left(\frac{m \times (k-1) \times k + 2 \times a \times k}{2}\right)
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     s = s + c \times \left(\frac{k \times (m \times (k-1) + 2 \times a)}{2}\right)
     \]

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(s % M)` statement will print the value of `s` modulo \(1000000007\).

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables. The final output will be the value of `s` after the update, modulo \(1000000007\).

Output: **s % M (where s is updated to s + c * (m * (k-1) * k / 2) + c * a * k, and c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo 1000000007)**
