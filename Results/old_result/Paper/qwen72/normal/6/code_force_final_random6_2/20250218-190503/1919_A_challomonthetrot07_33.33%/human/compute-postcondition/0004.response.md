Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input.
   - `T` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is equal to `b`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('Bob')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bob'`.
   - The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `T`, and `i`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
   - Since the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and simply prints a constant string, the output will always be `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
