Output State: **`T` is an input integer (1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4) decreased by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 1), `k` is the second integer from the input split by space (now converted to an integer and must be greater than 0), `a` is a list of integers representing the input split by spaces, `l` is 0 (or 1 if `a[l]` is 0), `r` is `n - 1` (or `n - 2` if `a[r]` is 0), `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `t` is `k % 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of `k % 2`, which is the remainder when `k` is divided by 2. Since `k` is a positive integer, `t` will be either 0 or 1 depending on whether `k` is even or odd, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
