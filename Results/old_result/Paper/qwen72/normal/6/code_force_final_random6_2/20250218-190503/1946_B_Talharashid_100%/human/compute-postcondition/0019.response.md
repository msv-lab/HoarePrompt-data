The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ele` and the list `l`. The loop iterates over the elements of `l`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `ele` must be the next element in the list `l`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `int(input())` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `n` and `k` are integers from the input split by a space
- `l` is a list of integers from the input split by a space that must have at least 2 elements
- `ele` is the second element in the list `l`
- If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, `c` and `maxi` remain 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to `c + ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ele` must be the third element in the list `l`, and the list `l` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers from the input split by a space that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, `c` and `maxi` remain 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to `c + ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0.**
