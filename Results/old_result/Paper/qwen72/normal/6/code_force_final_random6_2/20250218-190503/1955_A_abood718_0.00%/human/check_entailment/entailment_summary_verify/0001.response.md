### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary in detail to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Logic for Each Test Case:**
   - **Case 1: `B * 2 < C`**
     - If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is less than the promotion price (`C`), then it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price.
     - The program prints `A * B`, which is the total cost of buying `A` yogurts at the regular price.
     - This part of the logic is correct.

   - **Case 2: `A % 2 == 0`**
     - If the number of yogurts `A` is even, then Maxim can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.
     - The program prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the total cost of buying `A` yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.
     - This part of the logic is correct.

   - **Case 3: `A % 2 != 0`**
     - If the number of yogurts `A` is odd, then Maxim can buy `A // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price.
     - The program prints `X` (which is `A // 2`), and then prints `X * C + B`.
     - The function summary states that the program should print only the total cost `X * C + B` for this case. However, the program prints `X` separately, which is incorrect.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic for the first two cases is correct.
   - The logic for the third case is almost correct, but the program incorrectly prints `X` before the final result. This extra print statement is not part of the expected output and can cause the program to fail test cases.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issue, we need to remove the extra print statement for `X` in the third case. The corrected program should look like this:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Final Evaluation:
Given the reasoning and the corrected program, the original program is incorrect due to the extra print statement in the third case.

Final: **False**
