### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The cost of each operation is the length of the chosen substring.
   - We need to minimize the total cost of all operations.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The function reads a binary string and converts it into a list of integers.
     - It initializes two variables: `n` to count the number of 1s and `ans` to store the total cost.
     - It iterates through the string:
       - If the current character is `1`, it increments `n`.
       - If the current character is `0` and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
     - Finally, it prints `ans`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - **Input Handling in `func_1`:**
     - The function `func_1` reads the input using `input().split()`, which is incorrect for a binary string. The input should be read as a single string, not split into a list.
     - The correct way to read a binary string is `s = input().strip()`.
   - **Conversion to List of Integers:**
     - The function converts the string to a list of integers using `list(map(int, s))`. This is correct, but it should be `list(map(int, s.strip()))` if `s` is a string.
   - **Logic for Calculating Cost:**
     - The logic for calculating the cost is flawed. The cost should be calculated based on the number of 1s that need to be moved to the left of 0s, but the current implementation does not correctly handle this.
     - The current implementation adds `n + 1` to `ans` for each 0 that comes after at least one 1, which is not the correct way to calculate the minimum cost.
     - The correct approach is to find the number of transitions from `1` to `0` and calculate the cost based on these transitions.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - For a binary string to be sorted in non-descending order, all `1`s should be to the right of all `0`s.
   - The minimum cost to achieve this is the length of the longest contiguous segment of `1`s that needs to be moved to the right of all `0`s.
   - This can be calculated by finding the number of transitions from `1` to `0` and then summing the lengths of the substrings that need to be shifted.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The original assessment correctly identifies that `input().split()` is incorrect for reading a binary string. The correct way to read a binary string is `input().strip()`.
  - This is a significant issue that affects the correctness of the program.

- **Conversion to List of Integers:**
  - The original assessment correctly notes that the conversion to a list of integers should be `list(map(int, s.strip()))` if `s` is a string.
  - This is a minor issue but still important for the program to work correctly.

- **Logic for Calculating Cost:**
  - The original assessment correctly identifies that the logic for calculating the cost is flawed.
  - The current implementation adds `n + 1` to `ans` for each 0 that comes after at least one 1, which does not correctly calculate the minimum cost.
  - The correct approach involves finding the number of transitions from `1` to `0` and calculating the cost based on these transitions.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program has significant issues in input handling and the logic for calculating the cost, which make it incorrect for solving the given problem.

Final: **False**
