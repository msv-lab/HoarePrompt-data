#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of arr is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).
def func_1(arr):
    freq = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, `n` is the length of `arr` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the frequency of the integer `i` in `arr`.
    cou = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if freq[i] >= 2:
            continue
        
        if freq[i] == 1:
            cou += 1
        
        if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:

            break
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, `n` is the length of `arr` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `freq` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the frequency of the integer `i` in `arr`, `i` is the first index in `freq` where `freq[i]` is 0 or `cou` reaches 2. If `cou` reaches 2, the loop prints the value of `i` at which `cou` reaches 2. If `freq[i]` is 0 before `cou` reaches 2, the loop prints `i` and breaks. Otherwise, `cou` is the number of unique integers in `arr` that appear exactly once, and the loop has completed all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers, where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 200,000. It prints the first integer `i` that either has a frequency of 0 in `arr` or is the second unique integer in `arr` that appears exactly once. If no such integer is found, the function completes without printing anything. The function does not return any value.
