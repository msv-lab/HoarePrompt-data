Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `N` is greater than 0, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`, `t` is 1 if `cnt[i]` is 1, otherwise `t` remains 0. If `t` is at least 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.***
