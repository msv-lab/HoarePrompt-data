The function `func` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` (which is not used in the function) and a string `s`. The function then calculates the number of times the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' appear in `s`, and prints the result of `x + y - z` for each test case, where `x` is the count of 'map', `y` is the count of 'pie', and `z` is the count of 'mapie'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes.
