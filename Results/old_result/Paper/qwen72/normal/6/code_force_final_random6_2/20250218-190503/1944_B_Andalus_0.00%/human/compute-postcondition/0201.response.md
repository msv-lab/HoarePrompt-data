The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `rdb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `rdb`. If `rdb` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `elem` will be the first element in `rdb` at the start of the loop.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `sz` is 0, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to the negative of the number of elements in `sng` that were processed, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, `sng` must have at least as many elements as were processed, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`, `rdb` must have at least one element**
