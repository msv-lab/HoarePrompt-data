The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads input from `stdin`, where each input consists of two positive integers `n` and `k` such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26. The function processes these inputs and writes the output to `stdout`. 

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from `stdin`, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` within the range 1 to 26. It processes each test case and writes the result to `stdout`.**
