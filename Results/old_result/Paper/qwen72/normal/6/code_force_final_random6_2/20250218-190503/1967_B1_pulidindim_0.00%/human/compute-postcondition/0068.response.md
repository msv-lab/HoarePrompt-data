Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n`, `countmins` is 1, and `g` is the final value of `n / m - (m - 1)`. `m` must be at least 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `countmins` is updated to `count - 1`. Since `count` is 2, `countmins` becomes 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, and `g`) retain their initial values or conditions.
