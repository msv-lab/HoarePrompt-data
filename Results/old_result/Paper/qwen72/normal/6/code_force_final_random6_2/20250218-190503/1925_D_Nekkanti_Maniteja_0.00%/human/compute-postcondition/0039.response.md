Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is `m - 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the user over `m` iterations, `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated with the final values provided by the user in the last iteration, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, and the input value must be greater than `k - 1`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `m` iterations:
- The variable `i` will be `m - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `m - 1`.
- The variable `a` will be the sum of all `f` values provided by the user over the `m` iterations.
- The variables `u`, `v`, and `f` will hold the values provided by the user in the last iteration of the loop.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, and `c`) will remain unchanged from their initial values.
