Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, `sz` is 0.** 

The code initializes `sz` to 0, but does not change the values of `i` or the contents of `rdb`. Therefore, the initial state for `i` and `rdb` remains the same, and `sz` is now 0.
