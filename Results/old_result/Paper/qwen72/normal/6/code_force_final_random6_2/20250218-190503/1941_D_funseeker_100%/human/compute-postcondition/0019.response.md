Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and must have at least 2 elements, `m` is greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '0', `temp` is an empty set. If `c` is neither '0', '1', nor '?', `temp` remains an empty set. `q` is the next element in `ans`.**

Explanation:
- The code `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
- If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` initially contains the value `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
- After executing the code, `temp` will contain both `(q + r) % n` and `(q + r) % n`, but since sets do not allow duplicate values, `temp` will effectively contain only `(q + r) % n`.
- If `c` is '0', `temp` is initially an empty set, and after executing the code, it will contain `(q + r) % n`.
- If `c` is neither '0', '1', nor '?', `temp` remains an empty set, and after executing the code, it will contain `(q + r) % n`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged.
- `q` is the next element in `ans`, and its value is used in the calculation.
