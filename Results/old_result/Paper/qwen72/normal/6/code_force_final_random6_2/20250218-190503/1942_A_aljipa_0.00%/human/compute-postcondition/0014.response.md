The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `a`, and `k` is an integer representing the number of sorted cyclic shifts the array `a` must have, such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The function returns the number of sorted cyclic shifts of the array `a` that can be achieved with exactly `k` shifts.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the length of the array `a` and `k` is the number of sorted cyclic shifts. It returns the number of sorted cyclic shifts of the array `a` that can be achieved with exactly `k` shifts.**
