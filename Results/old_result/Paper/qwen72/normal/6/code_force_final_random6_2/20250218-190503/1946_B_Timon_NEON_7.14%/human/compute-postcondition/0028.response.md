Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and `arr` must have at least two elements. `i` is 1. `segments_variants` is a list that now includes the list `new_segment + [0]`. `max_segment` is equal to `new_segment`.**

The value of `max_segment` is now set to the value of `new_segment`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
