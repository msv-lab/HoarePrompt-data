### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Check if All Elements are the Same:**
   - The program uses a flag `flag` to check if all elements in the array are the same.
   - It iterates through the array and sets `flag` to `False` if it finds any element that is different from the previous one.

3. **Calculate Minimum Consecutive Elements:**
   - If the array is not all the same, the program initializes `ans` to infinity and `val` to the first element of the array.
   - It then iterates through the array to count consecutive elements equal to `val` and updates `ans` with the minimum count of such consecutive elements.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - If `flag` is `True` (all elements are the same), the program prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful.
   - Otherwise, it prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of consecutive elements equal to `val` that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

### Issues and Considerations:
- **Incorrect Function Signature:**
  - The function `func_1` should take two parameters: `t` and `arrays`, but it does not. This is a significant issue because the function is not designed to handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.
  - The function should be modified to accept `t` and `arrays` as parameters and process each array in `arrays`.

- **Consecutive Elements Calculation:**
  - The logic for calculating the minimum number of consecutive elements to remove is incorrect. The program only considers consecutive elements equal to the first element `val`, which is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
  - The correct approach should consider all possible consecutive elements that can be removed to break the "beautiful" property.

- **Use of Decimal:**
  - The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` is unnecessary and can be replaced with a simpler `float('inf')` or a large integer like `10**9`.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses the issues:

```python
def func_1(t, arrays):
    for _ in range(t):
        arr = arrays[_]
        n = len(arr)
        flag = True
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
                flag = False
                break
        
        if flag:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = float('inf')
            for i in range(1, n - 1):
                if arr[i - 1] == arr[i + 1]:
                    ans = min(ans, 1)  # Removing one element at index i will break the beautiful property
            print(ans)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    arrays = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        arrays.append(arr)
    func_1(t, arrays)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Function Signature:**
  - `func_1` now takes two parameters: `t` (number of test cases) and `arrays` (list of arrays for each test case).
- **Consecutive Elements Calculation:**
  - The program iterates through the array and checks if `arr[i - 1] == arr[i + 1]`. If this condition is met, it means removing `arr[i]` will break the "beautiful" property, and the minimum number of elements to remove is 1.
- **Output:**
  - If the array is all the same, it prints `-1`.
  - Otherwise, it prints `1` as the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
