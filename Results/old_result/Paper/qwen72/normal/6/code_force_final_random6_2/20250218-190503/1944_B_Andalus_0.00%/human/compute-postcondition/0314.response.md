Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and `2 * len(ldb)` plus 2, the program has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice, separated by spaces, `sng` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `elem` is the next element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next part of the code.***
