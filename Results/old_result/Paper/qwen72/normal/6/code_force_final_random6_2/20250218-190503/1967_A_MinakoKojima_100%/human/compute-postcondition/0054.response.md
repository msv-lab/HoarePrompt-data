Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `dif` is the difference between the fourth and the third element of the list `a`, `ans` is updated to `ans + k // 3`. If `i` is not 0, `res` is updated to `res + k % 3`.***
