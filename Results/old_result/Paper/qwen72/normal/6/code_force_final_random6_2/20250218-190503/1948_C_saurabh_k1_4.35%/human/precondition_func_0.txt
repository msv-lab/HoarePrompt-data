t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. The function receives a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer n and two strings of length n, each consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
