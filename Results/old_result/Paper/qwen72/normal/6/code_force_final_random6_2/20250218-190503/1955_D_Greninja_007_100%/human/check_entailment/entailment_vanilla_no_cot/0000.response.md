Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the way it updates the sliding window. Specifically, the conditions for incrementing and decrementing the `sm` (sum of matches) are incorrect. The program should correctly handle the addition and removal of elements from the sliding window to ensure that the count of matches is accurately maintained.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(b)
    ca = Counter(a[:m])
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1
    for r in range(m, n):
        # Add the new element to the window
        new_elem = a[r]
        ca[new_elem] += 1
        if new_elem in cb and ca[new_elem] <= cb[new_elem]:
            sm += 1
        
        # Remove the old element from the window
        old_elem = a[r - m]
        if old_elem in cb and ca[old_elem] <= cb[old_elem]:
            sm -= 1
        ca[old_elem] -= 1
        
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
    return ans

# Reading input and processing each test case
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, k, a, b))
```

### Explanation of the corrections:
1. **Adding the new element to the window:**
   - The new element `a[r]` is added to the counter `ca`.
   - If the new element is in `cb` and its count in `ca` is less than or equal to its count in `cb`, then it is a match, and `sm` is incremented.

2. **Removing the old element from the window:**
   - The old element `a[r - m]` is removed from the counter `ca`.
   - If the old element is in `cb` and its count in `ca` is less than or equal to its count in `cb`, then it was a match, and `sm` is decremented.

These changes ensure that the sliding window is correctly maintained and the count of matches is accurately updated.
