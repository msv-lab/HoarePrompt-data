### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided program initializes the answer `ans` to `n` and then iterates over possible values of `b` starting from 2 up to `m`.
   - For each `b`, it calculates `countmins` as `b - 1`.
   - It then computes `g` as `n / b`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, it updates `g` by subtracting `countmins` and adds \((g / b) + 1\) to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the integer value of `ans`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Initialization**: The initial value of `ans` is set to `n`. This is incorrect because the number of valid pairs should start from 0, not `n`.
   - **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from 2 to `m`. This is correct as it covers all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
   - **Calculation of `countmins`**: `countmins` is set to `b - 1`. This is correct as it represents the number of values less than `b`.
   - **Calculation of `g`**: `g` is set to `n / b`. This is incorrect because `g` should be the integer division of `n` by `b` (i.e., `n // b`).
   - **Condition Check**: The condition `if g < countmins` is correct as it ensures that the loop breaks if `g` is less than `b - 1`.
   - **Update of `ans`**: The update `ans += g / b + 1` is incorrect. It should be `ans += (g // b) + 1` to ensure integer division and correct counting of valid pairs.
   - **Final Output**: The program prints the integer value of `ans` after the loop, which is correct.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case \((1, 1)\), the only valid pair is \((1, 1)\). The program should output 1, but it starts with `ans = 1` and adds more, which is incorrect.
   - For the fourth test case \((10, 8)\), the valid pairs are \((1,1)\), \((2,1)\), \((2,2)\), \((3,1)\), \((4,1)\), \((5,1)\), \((6,1)\), \((6,2)\), \((6,3)\), \((7,1)\), \((8,1)\), \((9,1)\), \((10,1)\), \((10,2)\). The program should output 14, but due to the incorrect initialization and division, it may not produce the correct result.

### Conclusion:
The provided program has several logical and mathematical errors that prevent it from correctly solving the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
