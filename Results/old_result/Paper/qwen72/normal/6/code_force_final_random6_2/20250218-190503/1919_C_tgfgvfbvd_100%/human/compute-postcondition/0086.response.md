Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 0, `c` is 0, and `a` and `b` are both `float('inf')`. If `a` > `b`, then `a` is set to be equal to `b`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain `float('inf')`.***
