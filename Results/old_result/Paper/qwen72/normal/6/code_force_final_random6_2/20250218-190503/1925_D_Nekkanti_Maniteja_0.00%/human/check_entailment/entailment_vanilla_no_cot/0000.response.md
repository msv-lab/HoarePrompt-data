Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a logical error in the way it calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Let's break down the problem and the solution to understand why.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - \( n \): Number of children.
   - \( m \): Number of pairs of friends.
   - \( k \): Number of excursions.
   - \( (a_i, b_i, f_i) \): Pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.

2. **Output:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - For each excursion, the probability of choosing a specific pair is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values after \( k \) excursions can be calculated by considering the contribution of each pair of friends to the expected value.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Calculate the Probability:**
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair of friends is \( \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).

2. **Initial Contribution:**
   - Each pair of friends contributes its initial friendship value \( f_i \) to the expected value for each excursion.

3. **Incremental Contribution:**
   - Each pair of friends also contributes an additional 1 to the expected value for each subsequent excursion if it is chosen in the current excursion.

4. **Sum of Contributions:**
   - The total expected value is the sum of the initial contributions and the incremental contributions over all excursions.

### Correct Calculation:
- **Initial Contribution:**
  \[
  \text{Initial Contribution} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i
  \]

- **Incremental Contribution:**
  \[
  \text{Incremental Contribution} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \times k \times i \right)
  \]

- **Total Expected Value:**
  \[
  \text{Total Expected Value} = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \right) + \left( \frac{2k}{n(n-1)} \times \sum_{i=1}^{m} i \right)
  \]

- **Sum of First \( m \) Natural Numbers:**
  \[
  \sum_{i=1}^{m} i = \frac{m(m+1)}{2}
  \]

- **Final Formula:**
  \[
  \text{Total Expected Value} = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \right) + \left( \frac{2k \times \frac{m(m+1)}{2}}{n(n-1)} \right) = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \right) + \left( \frac{k \times m \times (m+1)}{n(n-1)} \right)
  \]

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        s = (a + k * m * (m + 1) // 2 * c) % M
        print(s)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Calculate the Inverse:**
   - \( c = \left( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \mod M \) is calculated using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - \( a = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \) is calculated by summing up the initial friendship values.

3. **Calculate the Total Expected Value:**
   - The total expected value is calculated using the formula derived above.
   - The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to ensure it fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The corrected program above should be used to solve the problem accurately. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.
