### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` and the list `lst` of length `2n`.

2. **Array Splitting**:
   - The program splits the list `lst` into two halves: `lft` (first half) and `rgt` (second half).

3. **Sorting**:
   - Both `lft` and `rgt` are sorted. This is a good approach because it helps in identifying pairs of duplicate elements easily.

4. **Finding Duplicates and Singles**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted `lft` array to find duplicates and singles.
   - Duplicates are added to the list `ldb` (left duplicates).
   - Singles are added to the list `sng` (singles).
   - Similarly, duplicates in the `rgt` array are added to the list `rdb` (right duplicates).

5. **Constructing Arrays `l` and `r`**:
   - The program constructs the array `l` by first adding pairs of duplicates from `ldb` until the size of `l` reaches `2k`.
   - If more elements are needed, it adds singles from `sng`.
   - The same process is repeated for the array `r` using `rdb` and `sng`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `l` and `r` in the required format.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Duplicates and XOR**:
  - The XOR of a pair of identical elements is zero. Therefore, adding pairs of duplicates to both `l` and `r` ensures that the XOR of these pairs is zero, which helps in balancing the XOR of the entire arrays.
  - If there are not enough pairs of duplicates, the program uses singles. However, the problem guarantees that at least one valid solution exists, so this should not be an issue.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where `k` is 1 by ensuring that it can always find a valid pair or single element to satisfy the XOR condition.
  - The program also handles the case where `k` is greater than 1 by ensuring that it can find enough pairs or singles to construct arrays of length `2k`.

- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly identifies and uses pairs of duplicates and singles to construct the arrays `l` and `r`.
  - The program ensures that the XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of elements in `r`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and logic. It constructs the arrays `l` and `r` such that the XOR of their elements is equal, and it handles the edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
