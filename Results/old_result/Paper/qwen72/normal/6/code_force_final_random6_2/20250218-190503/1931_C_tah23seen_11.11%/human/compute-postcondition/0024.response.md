Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `i` is less than or equal to `j`, `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i - 1]`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially less than or equal to `j`, this condition remains valid after the increment. The initial condition that `arr[i]` was equal to `arr[i + 1]` is now updated to `arr[i]` being equal to `arr[i - 1]` because `i` has been incremented.
