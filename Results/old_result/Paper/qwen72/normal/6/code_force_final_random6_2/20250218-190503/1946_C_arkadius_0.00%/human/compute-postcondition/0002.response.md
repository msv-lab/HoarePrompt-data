The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. The variable `i` should start at 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer read from the input, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` as its argument**
