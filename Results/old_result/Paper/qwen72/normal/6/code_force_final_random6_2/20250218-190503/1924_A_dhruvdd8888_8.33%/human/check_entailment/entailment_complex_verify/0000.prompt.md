You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters `n`, `k`, and `s`. `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES' and returns None.
    #State: `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, and it is now updated to the user input string. `us` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. `win` is an empty set. `ans` is a list containing the characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach a size of `k` and then cleared `win`. `ps` is the number of times `win` reached a size of `k` and was cleared, and `ps` is less than `n`.

The loop has printed a string for each element in `us` that was not in `win` at the time of iteration, and `win` has been updated to include these elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads user input to determine `n`, `k`, and `m` (integers), and a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It then processes `s` to find sequences of `k` unique characters. If the number of such sequences reaches `n`, the function prints 'YES' and returns `None`. If fewer than `n` sequences are found, the function prints 'NO' and, for each unique character in the first `k` alphabets that was not part of the last sequence, it prints a string composed of the characters that formed the sequences, followed by the missing character, and padded with 'a' characters to reach a length of `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, it fails to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the string `s`.

### Case When the Program Does Not Work Correctly:
Consider the input:
```
3
2 2 4
abba
2 2 3
abb
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

For the third test case:
- `n = 3`, `k = 3`, `m = 10`
- `s = "aabbccabab"`

The program should check if all possible strings of length 3 formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets (i.e., 'a', 'b', 'c') occur as a subsequence in `s`. The possible strings are:
- "aaa", "aab", "aac", "aba", "abb", "abc", "aca", "acb", "acc", "baa", "bab", "bac", "bba", "bbb", "bbc", "bca", "bcb", "bcc", "caa", "cab", "cac", "cba", "cbb", "cbc", "cca", "ccb", "ccc".

However, the program does not generate and check all these possible strings. Instead, it only checks if the window `win` contains all `k` characters and then appends the current character to `ans` if the condition is met. This approach is flawed because it does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are checked.

For example, the string "ccc" does not occur as a subsequence in `s`, but the program does not correctly identify this and prints "NO" followed by an incorrect string.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
