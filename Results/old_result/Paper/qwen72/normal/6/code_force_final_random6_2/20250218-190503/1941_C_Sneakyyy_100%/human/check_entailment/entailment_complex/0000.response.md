### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a string to make it beautiful, where a string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

Let's break down the program and analyze its correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `a`.

2. **Processing the String:**
   - The program initializes a variable `ans` to 0, which will store the count of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings "map" or "pie".
   - It uses a while loop to iterate through the string `a` with an index `i`.
   - For each position `i`, it checks a substring of length 3 (`a[i:i + 3]`).
   - If the substring is "map" or "pie", it increments `i` by 3 and increments `ans` by 1, effectively marking the removal of the entire substring.
   - If the substring is not "map" or "pie", it increments `i` by 1 to move to the next character.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing the string, the program prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Non-Overlapping Substrings:**
  - The program correctly identifies and counts non-overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie".
  - However, the problem requires the minimum number of characters to be deleted, not the number of non-overlapping substrings.

- **Character Deletion:**
  - The program increments `ans` by 1 for each non-overlapping occurrence of "map" or "pie". This is incorrect because each occurrence of "map" or "pie" requires the deletion of 3 characters, not 1.
  - For example, if the string is "mmapnapie", the program will count 2 occurrences of "map" and "pie" and print `ans` as 2, but the correct answer should be 6 (3 characters for "map" and 3 characters for "pie").

### Correctness:
- The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted. It counts the number of non-overlapping substrings instead of the number of characters to be deleted.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program needs to be modified to correctly count the number of characters that need to be deleted, which is 3 for each occurrence of "map" or "pie".
