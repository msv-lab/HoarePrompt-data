Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Input Handling**: `func_1` reads a list of integers (0s and 1s) from the input. However, the input is split using `input().split()`, which is incorrect for a binary string. Binary strings should be read as a single string and then converted to a list of integers.
- **Processing**:
  - It initializes `n` to count the number of 1s encountered so far.
  - It initializes `ans` to accumulate the cost.
  - For each character in the string:
    - If the character is 1, it increments `n`.
    - If the character is 0 and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
- **Output**: The function prints the accumulated cost `ans`.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Input Handling**: `func_2` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
- **Loop**: It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value, but `func_1` prints the result for each test case.

### Issues:
1. **Input Handling in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` uses `input().split()`, which is incorrect for reading a binary string. It should use `input().strip()` to read the entire string and then convert it to a list of integers.
   - Corrected code for `func_1` should be:
     ```python
     def func_1():
         s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
         n = 0
         ans = 0
         for i in range(len(s)):
             if s[i] == 1:
                 n += 1
             if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
                 ans += n + 1
         print(ans)
     ```

2. **Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The logic of adding `n + 1` to `ans` for each 0 that comes after at least one 1 is correct. This is because each 0 that comes after a 1 requires a shift of a substring of length `n + 1` to move the 0 to the correct position.
   - However, the function does not handle the case where the string is already sorted correctly. In such cases, the cost should be 0, and the function should print 0.

### Correctness:
- The logic in `func_1` is almost correct but has an issue with input handling.
- The logic in `func_2` is correct for handling multiple test cases.

Given the issues with input handling in `func_1`, the program is **incorrect** as it stands.

Correctness: **False**
