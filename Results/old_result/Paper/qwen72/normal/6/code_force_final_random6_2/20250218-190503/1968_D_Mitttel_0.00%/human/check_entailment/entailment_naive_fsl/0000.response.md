Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the game mechanics, including the detection and handling of cycles in the permutation, which is crucial for games lasting more than a few turns. The `calculate_score` function accurately computes the score for each player by following the rules of the game, and the `func_1` function correctly determines the winner based on the scores. The `func_2` function properly reads the input and processes multiple test cases, ensuring that the program works for all potential inputs as specified in the problem description. No edge cases or missing logic have been identified that would cause the program to fail.
