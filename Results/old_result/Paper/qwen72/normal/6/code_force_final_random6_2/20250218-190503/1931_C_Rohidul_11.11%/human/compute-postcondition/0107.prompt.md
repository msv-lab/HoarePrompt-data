You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the size of the array, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n, representing the elements of the array. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        l, r = 0, n - 1
        
        st, end = 0, 0
        
        while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
            l += 1
            st += 1
        
        while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
            r -= 1
            end += 1
        
        if a[0] == a[-1]:
            ans = r - l - 1
        elif st == 0 and end == 0 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            ans = len(a) - 1
        else:
            ans = r - l
        
        print(max(0, ans))
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1 for each test case, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input for each test case, `l` and `r` are indices such that `l` is the smallest index where `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l + 1]` and `r` is the largest index where `a[r]` is not equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the beginning of the list `a` that are equal to `a[0]`, `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal to `a[-1]`. For each test case, if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. If either `st` is not 0 or `end` is not 0, then `ans` is `r - l`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It processes each test case and returns a result for each one.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
