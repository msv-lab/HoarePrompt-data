Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer where `n` must be at least 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `x` is positive infinity, `y` is positive infinity, `i` is -1, and `s` is the total count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 0. If the length of `a` is 0, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is set to infinity. If the length of `b` is greater than 0, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `x > y`, `b` is updated to include `lit[i]` as its last element if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]`, `x` is set to the last element of `a` (which may be `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`), and `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `lit[i] > x`, `b` has `lit[i]` appended to it; otherwise, if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`, `a` has `lit[i]` appended to it, and `x` is now greater than or equal to `lit[i]`. If `x <= y`, `a` has one more element, which is `lit[0]` if `x == y`. If `x < y` and `x >= lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of `a` and `y` remains the last element of `b` if the length of `b` is greater than 0, otherwise `y` is infinity. If `x < lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, `a` has `lit[i]` appended to it. If `x < lit[i]` and `lit[i] <= y` but `lit[i] > x`, `b` has `lit[i]` appended to it. Otherwise, the state of `b` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1. If `x > y` and `y >= lit[i]`, `b` has `lit[i]` appended to it, `x` is set to the last element of `a` (which may be `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`), and `y` is set to the last element of `b` (which is now `lit[i]`). If `x > y` and `y < lit[i]`, and the length of `a` is greater than 0, `x` is set to the last element of `a`; otherwise, `x` is infinity. If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is infinity, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If the length of `b` is greater than 0, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `lit[i] > x`, `b` has `lit[i]` appended to it, and `x` is set to the last element of `a` (which may be `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`), and `y` is set to the last element of `b` (which is now `lit[i]`). If `lit[i] <= x` and `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, `a` has `lit[i]` appended to it, and `x` is set to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i] <= x` and `x < lit[i]` and `lit[i] <= y`, `b` has `lit[i]` appended to it. Otherwise, the state of `a` and `b` remains unchanged, and `x` and `y` retain their values based on the conditions described in the precondition. If `x <= y` and `x == y`, `a` has one more element which is `lit[i]`, `x` is now `lit[i]`, and `b` remains unchanged. If `x < y` and `x >= lit[i]`, `a` has `lit[i]` appended to it, `b` remains unchanged, and `x` is set to `lit[i]` (the last element of `a`), with `y` remaining the same (infinity if the length of `b` is 0, or the last element of `b` if the length of `b` is greater than 0). If `x < y` and `x < lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, `a` has one more element which is `lit[i]`, `b` remains unchanged, and `x` is set to `lit[i]` (the last element of `a`), with `y` remaining the same (infinity if the length of `b` is 0, or the last element of `b` if the length of `b` is greater than 0). If `x < y` and `x < lit[i]` and `lit[i] <= y` but `lit[i] > x`, `b` has `lit[i]` appended to it, and `y` is now `lit[i]` (the last element of `b`). If `x < y` and `x < lit[i]` and `lit[i] <= y` and `lit[i] <= x`, the state of `b` remains unchanged, and `x` is set to the last element of `a` (which may be `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y`), and `y` is set to the last element of `b` (which is `lit[i]` if `y < lit[i]`). If the length of `a` is 0, `x` is set to infinity. If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is set to infinity.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `x > y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `b` now contains the element `lit[2]` as its last element. If `x > y`, and `y` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` now contains the element `lit[i]` at the end of the list. If `x > y`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x <= y`, and `x` equals `y`, then `a` is no longer an empty list, and `x` is set to the last element of `a` (which is `lit[2]`). If `x <= y`, and `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` now contains the element `lit[i]` at the end of the list. If `x <= y`, and `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, `b` is no longer an empty list, and `y` is set to the last element of `b`, which is `lit[i]`. If `x <= y`, and `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` now contains the element `lit[i]` at the end of the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
