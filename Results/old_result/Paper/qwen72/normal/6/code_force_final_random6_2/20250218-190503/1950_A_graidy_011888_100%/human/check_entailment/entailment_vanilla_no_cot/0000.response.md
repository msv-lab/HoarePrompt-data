Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Condition Checking**:
   - It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair.
   - It checks if `a < b` and `b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".
3. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case as specified in the problem description.

The program follows the problem's constraints and requirements, and it will produce the correct output for valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
