To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the provided information step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(0 < t \leq 1000\). This means `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
   - `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended `t` times. This means the list `results` will have `t` elements, each of which is the result of calling `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.
   - `results` must have at least 3 elements. Since `t` is a positive integer, this condition is always satisfied as long as `t` is at least 3.
   - `result` is the third element in the `results` list. This means `result` is `results[2]` (since list indices are 0-based in Python).
   - `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
   - `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
   - `b` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
   - `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

2. **Understanding `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**:
   - The function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` is called `t` times, and the results are appended to the `results` list.
   - The exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, so we cannot determine the specific value of `result` without knowing what `func_1` does. However, we know that `result` is the third element in the `results` list, which is the result of the third call to `func_1`.

3. **Output of the `print(result)` Statement**:
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the value of the third element in the `results` list.
   - Since `result` is `results[2]`, it will print the result of the third call to `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.

Given the information, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **result (where result is the third element in the `results` list, which is the result of the third call to `func_1(n, a, b, c)`)**
