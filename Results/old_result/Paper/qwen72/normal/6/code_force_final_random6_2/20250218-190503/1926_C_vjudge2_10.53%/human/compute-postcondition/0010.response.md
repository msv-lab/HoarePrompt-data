Output State: **`t` is `t - 2` and must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing the input integers `n` and the new input integer `n`, `n` is the new input integer, `numbers` now contains an additional `n`.**

The value of `t` remains `t - 2` and must be greater than 0. The list `numbers` initially contained the input integers `n` and the new input integer `n`. After the code execution, `numbers` now contains an additional `n`, making it a list with three elements, all of which are the new input integer `n`. The value of `n` remains the new input integer.
