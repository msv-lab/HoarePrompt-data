To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the states of the variables `l`, `r`, and `a` that are involved in the loop condition. Let's break it down:

1. **Loop Condition**: `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`
   - `l < r` must be true.
   - `a[l] == a[l + 1]` must be true.

2. **Current State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
   - `n` is equal to `t`.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n` - 1.
   - `st` is 0.
   - `end` is 0.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - `l` is 0, and `r` is `n` - 1. For `l < r` to be true, `n` must be greater than 1. Since `n` is equal to `t`, `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `a[l] == a[l + 1]` must be true. This means that the first two elements of the list `a` must be equal.

Given these conditions, the state must be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 1 and the first two elements of `a` are equal.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1]`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 1, `st` is 0, `end` is 0**
