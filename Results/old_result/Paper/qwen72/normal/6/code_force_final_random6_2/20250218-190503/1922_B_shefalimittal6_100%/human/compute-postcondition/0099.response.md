Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `v[x]` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `n`, `_`, `x`, and `idx` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- `n` must still be greater than 1.
- `_` is still 1.
- `x` is still the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`.
- `idx` is still `idx + 2`.
