The function `func_1` should take two parameters: `t` (an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `arrays` where each inner list represents a beautiful array `a` of integers. Each `a` has a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and contains integers `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
