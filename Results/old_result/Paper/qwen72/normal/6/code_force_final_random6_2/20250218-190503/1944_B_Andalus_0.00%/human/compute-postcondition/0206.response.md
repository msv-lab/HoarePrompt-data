Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `T` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `lst` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
   - `rgt` is a sorted list in ascending order containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end.
   - `sz` is 0.
   - The difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to the negative of the number of elements in `sng` that were processed.
   - `ldb` must be a non-empty list.
   - `sng` must have at least as many elements as were processed.
   - `elem` is the first element in `rdb`.
   - `rdb` must have at least one element.
   - The current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - `elem` is defined as the first element in `rdb`.
   - Since `rdb` must have at least one element, `elem` is guaranteed to have a value.

4. **Output:**
   - The value of `elem` will be printed twice, followed by a space.
   - The exact value of `elem` depends on the first element of `rdb`, but it is an integer as `rdb` is a list of integers.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where elem is the first element of the list rdb)**
