Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, up to the `n-1` index, `sz` is 2, `ldb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `ldb`. The current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- `sz` is incremented by 2, so `sz` is now 2.
- The initial condition that `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2 is no longer valid, as `sz` is now 2. The new condition is that `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
