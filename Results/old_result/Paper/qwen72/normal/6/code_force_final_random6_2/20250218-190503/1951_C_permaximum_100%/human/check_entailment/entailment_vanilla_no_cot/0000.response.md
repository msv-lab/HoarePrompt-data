Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase exactly k tickets under the given constraints. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, as well as the list of prices for each day.

2. **Priority Queue Initialization**: The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with the initial prices and their corresponding days. This allows the program to always consider the cheapest available ticket first.

3. **Heap Operations**: The program uses a while loop to keep buying tickets until the required number `k` is reached. In each iteration:
   - It pops the cheapest ticket from the priority queue.
   - It increases the price of the ticket by the total price increase incurred so far.
   - It calculates the number of tickets to buy on that day, which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets that can be bought per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - It updates the total cost and the number of tickets bought.
   - It increases the price increase for subsequent days by the number of tickets bought.

4. **Output**: After the loop, the program prints the total cost for each test case.

This approach ensures that the program always buys the cheapest available tickets first, which is the optimal strategy to minimize the total cost. The use of a priority queue helps efficiently manage the dynamic prices and the constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought per day.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.
