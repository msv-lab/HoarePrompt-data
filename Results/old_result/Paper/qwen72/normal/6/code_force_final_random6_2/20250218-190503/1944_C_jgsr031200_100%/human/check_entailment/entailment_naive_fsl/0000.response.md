Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. However, the function does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Instead, it directly calculates the MEX of the array `arr` based on the frequency of elements, which is incorrect.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```
According to the problem, Alice and Bob will play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c`, respectively. The optimal strategy would lead to the array `c` being `[0, 1, 2]` or `[0, 1, 3]` after the game, and the MEX of `c` would be `3` or `2`, respectively. However, the program will output `1` because it does not simulate the game and instead just checks the frequency of elements in `arr`.

The correct implementation should simulate the game and consider the optimal strategies of both players. The provided code does not do this, hence it is incorrect.
