Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n` if `n` is even or `n - 1` if `n` is odd, `p` is a list where every even-indexed element (starting from 0) is filled with values decreasing by 2 starting from `n` down to `n - (n // 2) * 2`, and the rest are zeros, `ind` is 1 if `n` is odd or 2 if `n` is even.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ind` is updated to `1 + n % 2`.
- If `n` is odd, `n % 2` is 1, so `ind` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
- If `n` is even, `n % 2` is 0, so `ind` becomes `1 + 0 = 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, and `p`) remain unchanged.
