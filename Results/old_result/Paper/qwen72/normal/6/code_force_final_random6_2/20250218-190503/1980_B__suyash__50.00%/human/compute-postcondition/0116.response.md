Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order and must have at least 3 elements.
   - `k` is decreased by `dic[l[2]]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
   - The values of `i`, `l`, and `k` are not directly used in the `print` statement, so they do not affect the output.
   - The precondition provides information about the state of the program, but it does not influence the string being printed.

Given the above analysis, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward:

Output: **YES**
