Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and `ans` is 0 if `s[1]` is 1. If `s[1]` is 0 and `n` is not 0, `ans` is 1. If `s[1]` is 1 and `n` is 0, `ans` remains 0. If `s[2]` is 1, `n` is incremented by 1. If `s[2]` is 0 and `n` is not 0, `ans` is `n` + 1.***
