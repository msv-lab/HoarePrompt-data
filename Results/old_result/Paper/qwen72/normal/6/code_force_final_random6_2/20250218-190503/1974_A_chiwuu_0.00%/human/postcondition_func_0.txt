The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `n` from the user input, which represents the number of pairs of integers to process. For each of the `n` pairs, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, calculates a value `t` based on these integers, and prints the result. The value of `t` is determined by a series of arithmetic and conditional operations involving `a` and `b`. After processing all pairs, the function concludes without modifying any external state.
