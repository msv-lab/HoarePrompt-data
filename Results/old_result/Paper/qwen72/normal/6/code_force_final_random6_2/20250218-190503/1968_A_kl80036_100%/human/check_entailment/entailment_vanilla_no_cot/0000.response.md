Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program provided is correct for the given problem. The key insight is that for any integer \( x \), the value \( y = x - 1 \) will always maximize the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

1. **GCD Calculation**: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) is always 1 because \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) are consecutive integers, and consecutive integers are coprime (i.e., their GCD is 1).

2. **Expression Value**: Therefore, \( \gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = 1 + (x-1) = x \). This is the maximum possible value for \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) because for any other \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)), \( \gcd(x, y) \) will be at most \( x/2 \) (if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \)), and \( y \) will be less than \( x-1 \).

3. **Output**: The program outputs \( y = x - 1 \) for each test case, which is a valid and optimal solution.

Thus, the program correctly solves the problem for all valid inputs.
