### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid, where each row must have supports installed at the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes a single row of the river grid.
   - It sets the first element of the row to 1 (since the cost of installing a support in the first column is always 1).
   - It increments each element in the range from 1 to `d-1` by 2 (this is likely to account for the initial setup of the first few supports).
   - It uses a min-heap to dynamically update the cost of installing supports in the rest of the row, ensuring that the distance condition is met.
   - The function returns the last element of the modified row, which should represent the minimum cost of installing supports in that row.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It reads the grid of river depths and stores it in `rows`.
   - It calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1` and stores these costs in `costs`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing up the costs of `k` consecutive rows and appends these sums to `total_costs`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum value from `total_costs`, which represents the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**: The input is correctly read and parsed.
   - **Row Processing**: `func_1` correctly processes each row to find the minimum cost of installing supports, considering the distance constraint `d`.
   - **Total Cost Calculation**: `func_2` correctly calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges and finds the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.
   - **Output**: The output is the minimum total cost, which is the correct result for the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid, ensuring the distance condition is met. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
