Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, the current directory contains subfolders that can be represented as integers within the range [start, end], `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 2, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the new input string, `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. If `count_1 % 2 != 0`, no changes are made to the variables. If `s.count('11') == 1`, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
