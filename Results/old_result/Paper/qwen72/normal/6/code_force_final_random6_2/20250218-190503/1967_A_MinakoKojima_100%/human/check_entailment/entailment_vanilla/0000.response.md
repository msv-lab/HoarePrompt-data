### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` types of cards, with `a_i` cards of type `i`.
   - We can buy up to `k` new cards of any type.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - A subarray of length `n` is a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]` if it contains exactly one card of each type.
   - To maximize the score, we need to ensure that the number of cards of each type is as close as possible to each other, because this will allow us to form more permutations.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - **Initialization:** We initialize `ans` to the minimum number of cards of any type (`a[0]` after sorting) and `res` to `n - 1` (the number of types that need to be balanced).
   - **Balancing the Counts:**
     - We iterate through the sorted list of card counts.
     - For each type, we calculate the difference `dif` between the current type and the next type.
     - If `dif` is zero, it means the counts are already balanced, so we decrement `res`.
     - If `dif` is non-zero, we check if we have enough coins (`k`) to balance the counts up to the next type.
     - If we have enough coins, we increment `ans` by `dif` and decrement `k` by `dif * (i + 1)`.
     - If we don't have enough coins, we increment `ans` by the maximum possible amount (`k // (i + 1)`) and adjust `res` and `k` accordingly.
   - **Final Adjustments:**
     - If there are still coins left (`k != 0`), we use them to increment `ans` by `k // n` and adjust `res` by `k % n`.
   - **Calculating the Score:**
     - The score is calculated as `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is zero correctly by not attempting to buy any cards.
   - The program also handles the case where `k` is large enough to balance all card counts and still have some coins left.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly balances the card counts to form as many permutations as possible.
   - The final score calculation is correct and follows the logic of forming permutations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and follows the problem's requirements and constraints.
