Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `L` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.**

Explanation:
- `n` is updated to the length of `N`.
- `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`, where `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.
- `k` is `L[2]`, and `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
- `t`, `_`, `L`, and `M` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `n` is the number of elements in `N`.
