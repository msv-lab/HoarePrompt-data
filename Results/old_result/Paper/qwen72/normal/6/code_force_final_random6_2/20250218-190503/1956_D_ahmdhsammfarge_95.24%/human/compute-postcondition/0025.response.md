Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (3 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `sm` is the sum of the first element of `lst` plus the sum of elements from the third element to the end of `lst` plus 4, `over_sum` is equal to `sm`, `r` is [1, 2], `l` is [1, 2].**

Explanation:
- The value of `over_sum` is updated to be equal to `sm`.
- The values of `lst`, `i`, `j`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `sm` is greater than `over_sum` is no longer valid because `over_sum` is now equal to `sm`.
