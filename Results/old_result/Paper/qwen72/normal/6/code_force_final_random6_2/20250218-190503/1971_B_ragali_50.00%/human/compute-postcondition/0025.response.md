Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is the last character of `s`.
   - `s` is the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed.
   - `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s`.
   - The set `a` contains exactly one unique character.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'NO'`.
   - The values of `t`, `i`, `s`, and `a` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables or objects.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always output the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, or `a`.

Output: **NO**
