The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `int(input())` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `int(input())` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`i` is 2, `A`, `B`, and `C` are updated to the input integers, and `int(input())` is greater than 2. If `B * 2 < C`, there are no further changes. Otherwise, if `A` is even, there are no further changes. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.**
