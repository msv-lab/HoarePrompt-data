Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `first` is True if `mpp[i]` is 1, otherwise `first` remains False, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement after the if block.***
