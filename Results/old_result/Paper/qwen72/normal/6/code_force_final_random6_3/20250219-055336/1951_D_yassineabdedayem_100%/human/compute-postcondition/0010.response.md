The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer value `2`. The precondition provides information about the variables `t`, `_`, `n`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the value `2` that is explicitly printed.

Output: **2**
