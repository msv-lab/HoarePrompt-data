Output State: **`input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `index` is 13 + 4 * `n` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`), `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the most recent `result`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[index - 4:index - 4 + n]` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`), `a` is a list of integers from `data[index - 4:index - 4 + n]` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`), `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `t` is decreased by 1.**
