Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the third tuple and must have at least `len(arr)` elements, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the value of `count` has been appended to it, `count` is now 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary.**

The code snippet `mod_y_map = {}` initializes `mod_y_map` as an empty dictionary, but does not populate it with any values. Therefore, `mod_y_map` remains an empty dictionary. All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
