Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `onum` up to the point where the elements differ, or `n - 1` if all elements from index 0 to `n - 2` are equal, `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, and `cn` is `cn + ck`.** 

The value of `cn` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and `ck`. All other variables remain unchanged.
