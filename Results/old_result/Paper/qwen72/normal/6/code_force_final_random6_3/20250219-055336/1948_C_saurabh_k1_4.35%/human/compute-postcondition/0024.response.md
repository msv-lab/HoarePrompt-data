The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and a list of tuples. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is a list of integers where each integer is even and 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the size of the grid for each test case. The list of tuples contains two strings of length `n` with characters '<' or '>', representing the arrows in the grid for each test case.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines if the arrows in the grid form a valid configuration. If the configuration is valid, the function returns "Valid" for that test case; otherwise, it returns "Invalid".

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` (a list of even integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a list of tuples (each containing two strings of length n with characters '<' or '>'). It returns a list of results, where each result is "Valid" if the arrows in the grid for the corresponding test case form a valid configuration, or "Invalid" otherwise.**
