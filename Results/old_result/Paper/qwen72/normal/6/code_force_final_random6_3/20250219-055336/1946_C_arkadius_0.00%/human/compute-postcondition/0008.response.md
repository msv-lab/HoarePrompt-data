The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` is incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which is now 3).

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class initialized with `n` nodes, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `u` and `v` are specific integers provided by the user, an edge has been added between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the `tree`.**
