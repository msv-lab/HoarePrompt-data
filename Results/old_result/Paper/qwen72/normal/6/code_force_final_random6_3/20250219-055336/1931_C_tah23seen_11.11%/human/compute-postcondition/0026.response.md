Output State: **`i` is less than or equal to `len(arr)`, and `arr[i-1]` must be equal to `arr[i]`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now one step closer to `len(arr)`. The condition that `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]` is no longer valid because `i` has changed. However, the new condition that `arr[i-1]` must be equal to `arr[i]` is now true, reflecting the updated state of the array and the index.
