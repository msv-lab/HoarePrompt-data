### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the integer `n`.

2. **Special Character Requirement**:
   - The problem states that a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This means that for a string to have exactly `n` special characters, the string must be constructed in a way that each special character has exactly one neighbor that is the same as itself.

3. **Odd `n` Case**:
   - The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character has exactly one neighbor that is the same. This is because special characters must come in pairs to satisfy the condition of being equal to exactly one neighbor.

4. **Even `n` Case**:
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` using the pattern 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each 'A' is a special character because it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors (the other 'A' in the 'AAB' pattern).
   - The length of the string `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`, which is always less than or equal to 200 for `n` in the range [1, 50]. Therefore, the condition `len(s) < 200` is always true for valid inputs.

5. **Output**:
   - For even `n`, the program prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string `s`.
   - For odd `n`, the program prints 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. It ensures that for even `n`, a valid string is constructed and printed, and for odd `n`, it correctly reports that no such string exists.

### Correctness:
**True**
