Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has at least 4 elements, each element in `nums` is now 0, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums` before the loop, `i` is `len(nums) - 4`, `nw` is the same as the previous value of `cw`, `cw` is True.**

Explanation:
- The initial state is unchanged except for the variable `cw`.
- The code snippet `cw = True` sets the variable `cw` to `True`.
- All other variables (`test_cases`, `N`, `nums`, `ls`, `i`, `nw`) remain in their initial states.
