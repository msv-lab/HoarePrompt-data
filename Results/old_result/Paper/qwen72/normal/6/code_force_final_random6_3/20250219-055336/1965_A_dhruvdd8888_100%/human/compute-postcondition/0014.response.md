Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0, `ls` is now the sum of all elements in `nums` before the loop, and each element in `nums` is now 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `test_cases` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `N` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `nums` is a sorted list of integers that initially includes the integer 0. After the loop executes, each element in `nums` is reduced by the cumulative value of `ls` at each iteration, which eventually results in all elements in `nums` becoming 0.
- The variable `ls` is updated in each iteration by adding the current value of `nums[i]` after it has been reduced by `ls`. By the end of the loop, `ls` will be the sum of all the original values in `nums` before the loop started.
