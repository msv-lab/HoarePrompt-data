Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist), `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements, `sz` is 4 if `k - sz >= 2` was true, otherwise `sz` remains 2, `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged, `rdb` must have at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `rdb`, the difference between `k` and `sz` is greater than or equal to 0, if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is in, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial conditions and variable values remain the same.
