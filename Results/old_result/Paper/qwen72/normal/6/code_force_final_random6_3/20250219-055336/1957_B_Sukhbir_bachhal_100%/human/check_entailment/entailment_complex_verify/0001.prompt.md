You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1.
    #State: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and n is not equal to 0.
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: `n` is 0; `position` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial `n`.
    return position - 1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). It returns the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` minus one. If `n` is 0, it returns -1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) such that their sum is \( k \).
   - Additionally, the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers should be maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - If \( n \) is greater than 1, it uses a function `func_1` to determine the highest bit position set in \( k \).
   - It then constructs the sequence:
     - The first element is \( 2^{\text{counter}} - 1 \), which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position.
     - The second element is \( k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1) \), which ensures the sum of the first two elements equals \( k \).
     - The remaining \( n-2 \) elements are set to 0.
   - If \( n \) is 1, it simply prints \( k \).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` returns the highest bit position set in \( n \).
   - It works by right-shifting \( n \) until it becomes 0, counting the number of shifts.
   - The function returns the position of the highest bit minus 1 (since bit positions are 0-indexed).

4. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - **Sum Condition:** The sum of the sequence is \( k \). For \( n > 1 \), the sum is \( (2^{\text{counter}} - 1) + (k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1)) = k \). For \( n = 1 \), the sum is \( k \).
   - **Maximizing 1s in Bitwise OR:**
     - The number \( 2^{\text{counter}} - 1 \) has all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of \( k \).
     - The second number \( k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1) \) will have bits set in positions that are not covered by \( 2^{\text{counter}} - 1 \).
     - The bitwise OR of these two numbers will have all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of \( k \), which is the maximum possible number of 1s.
   - **Handling \( n = 1 \):** When \( n = 1 \), the sequence is simply \( k \), which trivially satisfies the conditions.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **\( n = 1 \):** The program correctly handles this case by printing \( k \).
   - **\( k = 0 \):** The program does not handle \( k = 0 \) explicitly, but since \( k \geq 1 \) as per the problem constraints, this is not an issue.
   - **\( n > 1 \) and \( k \) is a power of 2:** The program will correctly set the first element to \( k - 1 \) and the second element to 1, ensuring the sum is \( k \) and the number of 1s in the bitwise OR is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers that sum to \( k \) and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.
