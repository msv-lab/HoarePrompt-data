You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple (op_type, value) has op_type as an integer in {1, 2} and value as a positive integer, and queries is a list of positive integers such that 1 <= k <= min(10^18, c) for each k in queries, where c is the length of the array after all operations.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a list of tuples with `n` tuples, `array` is a list that contains the elements added by the operations in `operations` and possibly repeated based on the `op_type` values, `result` is an empty list, `op_type` is the last tuple's `op_type` in `operations`, and `value` is the last tuple's `value` in `operations`.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a list of tuples with `n` tuples, `array` is a list that contains the elements added by the operations in `operations` and possibly repeated based on the `op_type` values, `result` is a list containing the elements at indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`, `op_type` is the last tuple's `op_type` in `operations`, `value` is the last tuple's `value` in `operations`, `queries` is a non-empty list.
    return result
    #The program returns the list `result` which contains the elements at indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`. The elements in `array` are determined by the operations specified in the `operations` list, and the final `op_type` and `value` are from the last tuple in `operations`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list of tuples `operations` where each tuple represents an operation on an array, and a list of positive integers `queries`. It returns a list `result` containing the elements at specific indices in the array, as determined by the operations and the queries.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `result` which contains the elements at indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`. The elements in `array` are determined by the operations specified in the `operations` list, and the final `op_type` and `value` are from the last tuple in `operations`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
