The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`.
- `m` is an integer representing the length of the list `b`.
- `k` is an integer that must be between 1 and `m` inclusive.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers, each ranging from 1 to 10^6.
- `b` is a list of `m` integers, each ranging from 1 to 10^6.

The function returns the number of times the sum `sm` of elements from list `b` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop iterations.

Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It returns the number of times the sum of elements from list `b` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop iterations.**
