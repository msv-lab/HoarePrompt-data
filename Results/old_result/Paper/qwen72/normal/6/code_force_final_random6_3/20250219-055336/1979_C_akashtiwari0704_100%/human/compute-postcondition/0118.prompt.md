Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to handle input through a predefined structure not shown in the function definition, typically involving multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the winning outcomes. The function should output a list of n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9) representing the bets on each outcome, or -1 if no valid distribution exists. `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):

    def lcm(l):
        g = 1
        for i in range(len(l)):
            g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
        return g
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = lcm(a)
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *After the loop executes all the iterations, `bets` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `bets - 1`, and each element in `a` is updated to `prod // a[i]` where `i` ranges from 0 to `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`. Otherwise, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `bets` is greater than 0, and `ans` is a string containing the values of `str(a[0])`, `str(a[1])`, ..., `str(a[bets-1])` each followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`bets` is greater than 0, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the updated list `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `str(a[0])`, `str(a[1])`, ..., `str(a[bets-1])` each followed by a space. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`. Otherwise, `sumo` is less than `prod`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`bets` is an input integer, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `bets - 1`) is updated to `prod // a[j]`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the updated list `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the original list `a`, `T` is `T + 1`, `t` must be greater than `T + 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, `ans` is no longer valid. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing all elements of the updated list `a` separated by spaces, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
