Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1 if all elements in `num` are the same, otherwise `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where the first pair of consecutive elements differ. Additionally, either `n` is 1 or all elements in `num` are the same (i.e., `f` is 1). The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
