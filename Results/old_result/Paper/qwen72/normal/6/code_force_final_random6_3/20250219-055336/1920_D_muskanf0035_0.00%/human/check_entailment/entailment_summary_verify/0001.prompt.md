You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads a series of inputs from the user. It first reads an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 5000), which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `q` (1 <= n, q <= 10^5), followed by `n` lists of integers (each representing an operation) and a list of `q` integers (representing queries). It then calls another function `func_1` with `n`, `operations`, and `queries` as arguments, and prints the result returned by `func_1`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the results of each test case have been printed.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to handle two types of operations on an initially empty array:
     - Append an integer `x` to the array.
     - Append `x` copies of the current array to itself.
   - After performing all operations, we need to answer queries about the `k`-th element of the array.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (number of operations), `operations` (list of operations), and `queries` (list of queries).
   - It initializes an empty array `array` and an empty result list `result`.
   - It iterates through each operation:
     - If the operation type is 1, it appends the value to the array.
     - If the operation type is 2, it extends the array by appending `x` copies of the current array to itself.
   - After all operations, it processes each query by appending the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` to the result list.
   - Finally, it returns the result list.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It reads the operations and queries.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the result.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - **Memory and Performance:**
     - The array can grow very large, especially with operation type 2, which appends `x` copies of the current array. This can lead to memory issues and slow performance.
     - For example, if `x` is a large number (up to \(10^9\)), the array can become extremely large, which is not feasible to store in memory.
   - **Correctness of Query Handling:**
     - The query handling in `func_1` uses `(k - 1) % len(array)` to find the `k`-th element. This assumes that the array is cyclic, which is not always the case.
     - For large `x` values in operation type 2, the array length can exceed the query indices, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

5. **Correctness Evaluation:**
   - The current implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` will work for small inputs and simple cases, but it will fail for large inputs due to memory and performance issues.
   - The query handling is also incorrect for large `x` values in operation type 2, as it does not account for the actual size of the array after each operation.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all valid inputs as described in the problem.

Correctness: **False**
