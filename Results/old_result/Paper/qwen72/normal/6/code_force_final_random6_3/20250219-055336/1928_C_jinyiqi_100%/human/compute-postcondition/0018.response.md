The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`, where `x` is an integer such that \(1 \le x \le 10^9\). The function returns a list that combines `output2` and `output1`. `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in reverse order. `output2` contains the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` within the range \(1 \le x \le 10^9\) and returns a list containing all divisors of `x`. The list is composed of two parts: the first part contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order, and the second part contains the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`.**
