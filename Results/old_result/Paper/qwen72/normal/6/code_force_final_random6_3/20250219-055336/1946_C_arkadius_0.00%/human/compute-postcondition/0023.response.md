Output State: **The program returns `good_components` and `remaining_size`. `good_components` is the sum of all `good_components_subtree` values for each child of vertex `v` plus the number of children whose `remaining_size_subtree` is greater than or equal to `x`. `remaining_size` is 1 plus the sum of all `remaining_size_subtree` values for children whose `remaining_size_subtree` is less than `x`.**
