Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` from the user, representing the number of times it will process a time input. For each of the `n` times, it reads a time in the format "hh:mm" from the user, converts it to a 12-hour format, and prints the time along with 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` is 0, and the program state is such that the function has printed the converted times for all `n` inputs. **
