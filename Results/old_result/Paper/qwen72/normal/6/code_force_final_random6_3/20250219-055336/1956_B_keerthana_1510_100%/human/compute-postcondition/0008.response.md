Functionality: ** The function `func` reads from the standard input (file descriptor `0`), processing every third line starting from the third line. For each processed line, it calculates the difference between the number of tokens (words) and the number of unique tokens in the line, and prints this difference. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is unchanged except for the side effect of printing the calculated differences for each line. **
