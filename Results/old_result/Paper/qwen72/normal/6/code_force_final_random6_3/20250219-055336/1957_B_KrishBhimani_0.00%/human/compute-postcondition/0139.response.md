Output State: **`arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is the number of elements in `arr`, `ans` is a list containing elements where each element is `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr`. If `c` is `n - 1`, the last element of `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`. The length of `ans` is now `n`, with the additional elements being 0.**
