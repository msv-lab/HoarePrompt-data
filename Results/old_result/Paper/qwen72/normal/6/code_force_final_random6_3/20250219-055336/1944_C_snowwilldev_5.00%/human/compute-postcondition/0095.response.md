Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is a new input integer greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `tc` is 2.
   - `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with default integer values and now contains the count of each element in `a`.
   - `a` is a new list of integers input by the user.
   - If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is 1 or 2 depending on the count of the element at index 1 in `a` plus 1. Otherwise, `t` remains 0 or 1 depending on the count of the element at index 1 in `a`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `i`:**
   - According to the initial state, `i` is explicitly set to 2.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
