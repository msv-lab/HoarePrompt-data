Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `num2` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 <= num2 <= 500, `i` is `num2 - 1`, `order` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than or equal to the next element in the list from index 0 to `num2 - 2`, and `order` is not equal to 0.**
