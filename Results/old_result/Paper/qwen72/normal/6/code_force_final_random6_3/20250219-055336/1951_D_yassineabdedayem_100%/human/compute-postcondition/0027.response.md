Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are the new input integers. If `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` holds. Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`. Regardless of the condition, if `n` is equal to `k`, the condition `n == k` holds.***
