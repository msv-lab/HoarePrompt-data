Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the segment with the highest sum from the list of segments that contain at least one non-negative number, where each segment is represented as a list containing the sum of the segment, the starting index, and the ending index. If no such segment is found, the function returns `[-1]`. The input list `arr` remains unchanged. **
