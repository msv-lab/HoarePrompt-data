The function `func_2` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `q`. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, and `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5. The sum of `n` and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `q`, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, and `n` and `q` are positive integers between 1 and 100,000. The sum of `n` and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 100,000. The function returns a result based on these parameters.**
