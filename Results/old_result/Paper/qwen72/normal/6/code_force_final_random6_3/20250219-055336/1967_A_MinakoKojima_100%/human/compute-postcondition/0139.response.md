Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, `ans_list` now contains `a[0]` and `ans`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, and `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`.
- Since the initial state specifies that `a` remains a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input.
- The values of `ans`, `ans_list`, `n`, `k`, and `res` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.
