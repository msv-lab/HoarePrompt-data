### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. The function `func_1` only checks the frequency of elements in the array `arr` and prints the first integer that appears exactly once or does not appear at all, which does not align with the game's rules and objectives.

Let's break down the function `func_1` and the game rules:

1. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each integer in `arr` and stores it in the `freq` list.
   - This step is correct and necessary to understand the distribution of elements in `arr`.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The game's objective is to find the MEX of the array `c` after all elements are removed from `arr` by Alice and Bob.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The function `func_1` does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob or consider their optimal strategies. Instead, it prints the first integer that appears exactly once or does not appear at all, which is not the correct approach.

3. **Counterexample Analysis:**
   - The counterexample provided in the original assessment is valid. For the input:
     ```
     1
     5
     0 1 2 3 4
     ```
   - The expected output is 1, but the program outputs 5.
   - The optimal game play, as described, results in `c = [0, 2, 4]`, and the MEX of `c` is 1, not 5.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game and consider the optimal moves for both players.
   - Alice should always pick the smallest integer that appears exactly once in `arr` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should always pick the smallest integer that appears exactly once in `arr` to minimize the MEX.
   - If no such integer exists, Alice and Bob should pick the smallest integer that appears more than once.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game, and the counterexample clearly demonstrates this.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
