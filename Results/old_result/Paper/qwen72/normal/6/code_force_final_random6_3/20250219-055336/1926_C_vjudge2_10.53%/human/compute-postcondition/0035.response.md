The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 10, and `n` must be at least 9. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be at least 11 to allow the loop to continue.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 respectively, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except the first 10 elements which are 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, and 45 respectively, `sum_values[10]` is 54, `total` is 45, `i` is 11, `n` must be at least 11, `word` is '10', `last` is 0, `remainder` is 1, `values[10]` is 9, `sum_total` is 54**
