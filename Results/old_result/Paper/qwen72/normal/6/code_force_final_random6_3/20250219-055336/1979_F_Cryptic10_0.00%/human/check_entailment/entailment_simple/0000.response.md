### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a complete undirected graph with \( n \) vertices.
   - \( n - 2 \) edges are removed from the graph.
   - We need to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using at most \( n \) queries.
   - Each query of the form `"? d "` returns a vertex \( v \) with a degree at least \( d \) and another vertex \( u \) that is not connected to \( v \) (or 0 if no such vertex exists).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices \( n \) and calls `func_2(n)` to find the Hamiltonian path.
   - `func_2(n)` initializes an empty list `path` and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from 1 to \( n \).
   - It then enters a loop that continues until `remaining_vertices` is empty.
   - Inside the loop, it iterates over possible degrees \( d \) from \( n-1 \) down to 0.
   - For each degree \( d \), it calls `func_1(d)` to get the vertex \( v \) and another vertex \( u \).
   - If \( v \) is 0, it continues to the next degree.
   - If \( v \) is a valid vertex (i.e., it is in `remaining_vertices`), it appends \( v \) to `path` and removes \( v \) from `remaining_vertices`.
   - The loop breaks after a valid vertex \( v \) is found and processed.
   - Finally, it prints the Hamiltonian path and flushes the output buffer.

3. **Function `func_1(d)`:**
   - This function prints the query `"? d "` and reads the response \( v \) and \( u \).
   - It returns the pair \( (v, u) \).

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly follows the interaction protocol by printing queries and reading responses.
   - It ensures that the number of queries does not exceed \( n \) by breaking the loop after a valid vertex is found and processed.
   - The program correctly handles the case where no vertex with the required degree is found (i.e., \( v = 0 \)).
   - The program constructs a Hamiltonian path by iteratively selecting vertices with the minimum degree and removing them from the graph.
   - The final path is printed in the required format.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding a Hamiltonian path in the graph using the specified queries. It adheres to the constraints and interaction rules provided in the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
