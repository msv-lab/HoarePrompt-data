Output State: **`bets` is greater than 0, `i` is `bets`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the updated list `a`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `str(a[0])`, `str(a[1])`, ..., `str(a[bets-1])` each followed by a space, if `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`. Otherwise, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `T` is `T + 1`, `t` must be greater than `T + 1`, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a non-empty list with a length greater than `bets`.**

Explanation:
- The code `g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])` updates the value of `g` to the result of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.
- The value of `i` is `bets`, so `l[i]` is `l[bets]`.
- The `gcd` function computes the greatest common divisor of `g` and `l[bets]`.
- The new value of `g` is the result of `g * l[bets] // gcd(g, l[bets])`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
