Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer with a range \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `t` is now `t - 1`, which means `t` has been decremented by 1.
- `n` is an input integer with a range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `i` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the string `'1'` with the `end` parameter set to `' '`. This means that after printing `'1'`, the cursor will remain on the same line, followed by a space.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` are not used in the `print` statement, so they do not affect the output.

### Output:
The code will print the string `'1'` followed by a space.

Output: **1 **

This is the exact output that will be printed when the `print` statement is executed.
