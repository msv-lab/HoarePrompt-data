### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line.
   - It then reads the list of ticket prices `M` from the second line.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `m` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure that the maximum number of tickets purchasable per day does not exceed the total number of tickets needed.
   - The list of ticket prices `M` is sorted in ascending order to minimize the cost.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Cost**:
   - The number of days required to buy all `k` tickets is calculated as `q = math.ceil(k / m)`.
   - The first `q` days' prices are stored in `N`.
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in these `q` days equals `k` (i.e., `n * m == k`), the cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - If not, the last day's price is removed from `N` and the remaining tickets are bought on the last day. The cost is then calculated as `mu * w` (where `mu` is the number of tickets bought on the last day and `w` is the price on that day) plus the cost of buying `m` tickets on the other days.

4. **Output**:
   - The calculated cost is printed for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Sorting the Prices**: Sorting the prices in ascending order ensures that the cheapest tickets are bought first, which is a good strategy to minimize the total cost.
- **Ceiling Calculation**: `q = math.ceil(k / m)` correctly calculates the number of days required to buy all `k` tickets, considering the maximum `m` tickets per day.
- **Cost Calculation**:
  - If `n * m == k`, the cost is calculated correctly by summing the prices of the first `q` days and adding the incremental cost due to the price increase.
  - If `n * m != k`, the function correctly handles the remaining tickets by buying them on the last day and adjusting the cost accordingly.

### Potential Issues:
- **Price Increase Calculation**: The function does not correctly account for the price increase on subsequent days. The price increase should be applied to the remaining days' prices, but the function does not update the prices in `N` after each purchase.
- **Logic for Remaining Tickets**: The logic for handling the remaining tickets on the last day is not entirely correct. The incremental cost should be applied to the remaining days' prices, but the function does not handle this correctly.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with the price increase calculation and the logic for handling remaining tickets, the function does not correctly implement the required algorithm to find the minimum cost.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
