The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, and then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function concludes, `t` is the number of times `func_1` was called, and the final state of the program includes the side effects of `func_1` being called `t` times.
