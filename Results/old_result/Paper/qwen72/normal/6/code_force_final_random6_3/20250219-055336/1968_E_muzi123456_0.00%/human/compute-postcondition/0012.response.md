Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `t` is then updated to `t - 1`. This means `t` is now one less than its original value, but it still remains a positive integer within the range \(0 \leq t \leq 49\).
   - `n` is an input integer with the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
   - `i` is explicitly defined as 3.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of `i`.
   - From the initial state, we know that `i` is explicitly defined as 3.

Therefore, the output of the `print(i)` statement will be:

Output: **3**
