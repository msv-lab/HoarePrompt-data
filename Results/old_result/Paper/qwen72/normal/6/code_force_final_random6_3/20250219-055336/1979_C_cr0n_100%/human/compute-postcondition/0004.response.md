Output State: **`N` is an input integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 50), `vals` is a list of N integers where each integer `k_i` satisfies (2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20), `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)`, `x` is the first integer in the list `vals`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `den = func_1(den, x)` updates the value of `den` to the result of the function `func_1` when called with `den` and `x` as arguments. The initial value of `den` is the first integer in the list `vals`, and `x` is also the first integer in the list `vals`. After the execution, `den` is updated, but the values of `N` and `vals` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is still the first integer in the list `vals`.
