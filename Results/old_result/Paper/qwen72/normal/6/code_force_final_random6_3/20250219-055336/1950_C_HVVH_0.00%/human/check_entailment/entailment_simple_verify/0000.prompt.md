You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'PM'

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59.
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'PM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'AM'
        
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is 0, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the initial conditions and the input times provided. For each iteration, if `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` > 12, `h` is decreased by 12 and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'PM'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the way it determines the AM/PM designation for the hours. Specifically, the program incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' for hours between 1 and 11, and it incorrectly sets `day` to 'AM' for the hour 12. This results in incorrect AM/PM designations for times in the afternoon and evening. 

For example, for the input "01:01", the program will output "01:01 PM" instead of the correct "01:01 AM". Similarly, for the input "12:14", the program will output "12:14 AM" instead of the correct "12:14 PM". 

The correct logic should be:
- Hours from 00 to 11 should be 'AM', with 00 being converted to 12.
- Hours from 12 to 23 should be 'PM', with 12 remaining as 12 and 13 to 23 being converted to 01 to 11.
