Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 3 to 78, `i` is 2, and `word` is either a string containing the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string followed by 'zz' if `n` > 52, or 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z' if `n` > 27 and `n` ≤ 52, or 'aay' if `n` is 27, or 'aa' followed by the (n-3)th letter of the alphabet if `n` is between 3 and 26.**

Explanation:
- `n` is reassigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer within the range 3 to 78.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `word` is determined based on the new value of `n`:
  - If `n` > 52, `word` is a string containing the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string followed by 'zz'.
  - If `n` > 27 and `n` ≤ 52, `word` is 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'.
  - If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'.
  - If `n` is between 3 and 26, `word` is 'aa' followed by the (n-3)th letter of the alphabet.
