Reasoning:  
The program aims to find a Hamiltonian path in a graph where exactly \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed from a complete undirected graph with \( n \) vertices. The program uses a query-based approach to interactively determine the path.

### Function Analysis:

1. **func_1(d):**
   - **Input:** A non-negative integer \( d \) such that \( 0 \le d \le n - 1 \).
   - **Output:** Two integers \( v \) and \( u \) provided by the interactor.
   - **Behavior:** The function sends a query to the interactor in the format `? d` and reads the response. The response is a vertex \( v \) with a degree of at least \( d \) and another vertex \( u \) that is not connected to \( v \) (or 0 if no such vertex exists). The function returns these two integers.

2. **func_2(n):**
   - **Input:** An integer \( n \) such that \( 2 \le n \le 10^5 \).
   - **Output:** A Hamiltonian path in the format `! v1 v2 ... vn`.
   - **Behavior:**
     - Initializes an empty list `path` to store the vertices of the Hamiltonian path.
     - Initializes a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from 1 to \( n \).
     - Uses a while loop to continue until `remaining_vertices` is empty.
     - For each \( d \) from \( n - 1 \) down to 0, it calls `func_1(d)` to get a vertex \( v \) and another vertex \( u \).
     - If \( v \) is 0, it continues to the next \( d \).
     - If \( v \) is in `remaining_vertices`, it appends \( v \) to `path` and removes \( v \) from `remaining_vertices`.
     - The loop ensures that each vertex is added to the path exactly once, and the set `remaining_vertices` is eventually empty.
     - Finally, it prints the Hamiltonian path in the required format and flushes the output buffer.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Query Handling:** The function `func_1` correctly sends the query and reads the response, which is essential for the interactive problem.
- **Path Construction:** The function `func_2` constructs the path by iteratively querying the interactor for vertices with the highest possible degree and ensuring that the selected vertex is removed from the graph. This approach is valid because it always selects the vertex with the minimum degree among those with a degree of at least \( d \), and it ensures that the vertex with the minimum number is chosen if there are multiple such vertices.
- **Termination:** The while loop in `func_2` ensures that the program continues until all vertices are included in the path, which is necessary to find a Hamiltonian path.
- **Output Format:** The final output format `! v1 v2 ... vn` is correct and matches the problem requirements.

### Potential Issues:

- **Query Limit:** The program is designed to make at most \( n \) queries, which is within the allowed limit.
- **Hamiltonian Path Existence:** The problem guarantees that a Hamiltonian path always exists under the given constraints, so the approach should always find a valid path.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the required logic to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using the provided interactive queries. It adheres to the constraints and ensures that the path is constructed correctly.

Correctness: **True**
