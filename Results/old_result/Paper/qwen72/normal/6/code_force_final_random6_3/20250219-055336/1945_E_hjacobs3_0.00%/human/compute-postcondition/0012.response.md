Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `mid` is (`l` + `r`) // 2, `l` is `mid` + 1, `r` is `mid` - 1, and `l` is now `mid` + 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.
- The other variables (`array`, `find`, `n`, `mid`, and `r`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `l` must be less than or equal to `r` is still valid, but `l` is now `mid + 1`.
