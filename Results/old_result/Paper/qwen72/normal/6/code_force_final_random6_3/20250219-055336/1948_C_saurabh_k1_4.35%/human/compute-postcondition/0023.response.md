Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations. `_` is equal to the number of test cases minus 1, `n` is the last input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4), `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the last input, and `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the last input. If the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`, then the condition is met and 'No' is printed. Otherwise, the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is not the string `"<"` and 'Yes' is printed.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for a total of `t` iterations, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- After all iterations, `_` will be equal to `t - 1` because the loop starts with `_` at 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration.
- For each iteration, `n` is read from the input, and `a` and `b` are lists of characters from the input strings.
- The final values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be those from the last iteration.
- The condition inside the loop checks if the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is `"<"`. If it is, 'No' is printed; otherwise, 'Yes' is printed. This condition is checked for each iteration, and the final output will depend on the last iteration's values.
