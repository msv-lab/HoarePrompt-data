The only objects in the loop head are the variables `remainder_steps` and the loop counter `_`. The loop can execute one more time if `remainder_steps` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0, and the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `remainder_steps` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `remainder_steps` must still be greater than 0. The loop counter `_` is not explicitly tracked in the state, so we focus on `remainder_steps`.

Since the loop executes `remainder_steps` times, after the last iteration, `remainder_steps` is decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `remainder_steps` must be at least 1.

State: **`cycle_length` must be greater than 0, `cycle_score` is incremented by the value of `a[cycle_pos - 1]` for each iteration, `cycle_pos` is updated to `p[cycle_pos - 1]` after each iteration, the loop executes `cycle_length` times, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length` and must be greater than 0, `score` is increased by `full_cycles * cycle_score` and `a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]`, `remainder_steps` is `remainder_steps - 1` and must be greater than 0**
