To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which are `elem` and `rdb`. The loop will execute if `rdb` is not empty. The state of `elem` will be determined by the first element in `rdb` when the loop starts.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist)
- `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements
- `sz` is 0
- `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged
- `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before `sz` reached or exceeded `k`. If `sz` never reaches or exceeds `k`, then `elem` is the last element in `sng`.

For the loop to execute:
- `rdb` must have at least one element.
- `elem` will be the first element in `rdb` when the loop starts.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist), `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements, `sz` is 0, `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rdb` remain unchanged, `rdb` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`**
