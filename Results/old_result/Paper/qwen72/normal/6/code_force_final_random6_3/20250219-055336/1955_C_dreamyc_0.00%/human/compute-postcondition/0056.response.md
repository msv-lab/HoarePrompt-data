Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer indicating the length of the list `nums`), `k` (a positive integer representing the total reduction capacity), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns the total count of elements that have been fully reduced to 0 or less during the loop execution. If, after the loop, there is exactly one element left in `nums` and `k` is greater than or equal to this single remaining element, the function returns this count plus one. Otherwise, it returns the count of fully reduced elements. The original list `nums` is transformed into a deque during the function execution, and elements that are not fully reduced are returned in the deque, which may be empty or contain fewer elements than the original list. **
