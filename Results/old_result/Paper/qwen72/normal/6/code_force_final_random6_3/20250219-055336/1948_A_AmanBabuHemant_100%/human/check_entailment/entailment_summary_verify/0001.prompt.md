You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and checks if `n` is even. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO". If `n` is even and the length of the string generated by repeating 'AAB' `n // 2` times is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the generated string. If the length of the generated string is 200 or more, it prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the integer `n`.

2. **Special Character Requirement**:
   - The problem states that a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This means that for a string to have exactly `n` special characters, the string must be constructed in a way that each special character has exactly one neighbor that is the same as itself.

3. **Odd `n` Case**:
   - The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character has exactly one neighbor that is the same. This is because special characters must come in pairs to satisfy the condition of being equal to exactly one neighbor.

4. **Even `n` Case**:
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` using the pattern 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each 'A' is a special character because it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors (the other 'A' in the 'AAB' pattern).
   - The length of the string `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`, which is always less than or equal to 200 for `n` in the range [1, 50]. Therefore, the condition `len(s) < 200` is always true for valid inputs.

5. **Output**:
   - For even `n`, the program prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string `s`.
   - For odd `n`, the program prints 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. It ensures that for even `n`, a valid string is constructed and printed, and for odd `n`, it correctly reports that no such string exists.

### Correctness:
**True**
