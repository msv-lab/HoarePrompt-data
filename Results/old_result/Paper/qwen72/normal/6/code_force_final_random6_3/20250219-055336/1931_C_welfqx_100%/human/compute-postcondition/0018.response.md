Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1 if all elements in `num` are the same, otherwise `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where the first pair of consecutive elements differ.**

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `t` remains an input integer within the given range, `r` remains 0, `n` remains the input integer, and `num` remains the list of integers provided by the user. The variable `f` will be 1 if all elements in `num` are the same; otherwise, `f` will be 0. The variable `j` will be `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, or it will be the index where the first pair of consecutive elements in `num` differ, causing the loop to break.
