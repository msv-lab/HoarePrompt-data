To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This is the loop index, which starts at 0.
2. **Variable `n`**: This is the number of iterations the loop will perform. Since `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and equal to `t`, it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and equal to `t`.
- `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
- `first` is False.
- `i` is the index of the first integer in `arr` that either does not appear in `mpp` or appears exactly once and `first` is True, or `n` if the loop completes without breaking.

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must start at 0.

The other variables and objects (`t`, `a`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
