Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2. If the length of `lit` is 0, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`. If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x > y`: If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]`, then `b` is a list with the last element equal to `lit[2]`. If `lit[2]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list with the last element being `lit[2]`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a list containing `lit[2]`. If none of these conditions are met, `a` remains unchanged. If `x <= y`: If `x == y`, `a` is a list containing `lit[2]`. If `x < y`, then: if `x >= lit[2]`, `a` is a list that includes `lit[2]`. If `x < lit[2]` and `lit[2] > y`, `a` is a list that includes `lit[2]`. If `x < lit[2]` and `y >= lit[2]` and `lit[2] > x`, `b` is a list with the last element being `lit[2]`. If `x >= y`, there are no changes to `a` or `b`.**
