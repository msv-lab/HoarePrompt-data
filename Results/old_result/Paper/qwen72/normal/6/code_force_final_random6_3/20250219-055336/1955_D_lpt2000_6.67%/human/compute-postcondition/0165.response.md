Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of integers with a length greater than `m + 1`, `in_aa` is the second element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the second element in `aa[:n - m]`, `tot` is the sum of all values in `D`, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. If `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.***
