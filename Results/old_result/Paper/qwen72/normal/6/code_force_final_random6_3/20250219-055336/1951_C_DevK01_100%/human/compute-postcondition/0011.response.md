Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is not explicitly set before the loop but will be assigned values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop's execution, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is equal to `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `n * m` is equal to `k`, `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**

Explanation:
- `cost` is calculated using the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- `sum(N)` is the sum of the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`.
- `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is the result of the arithmetic series formula for the sum of the first `n-1` natural numbers, multiplied by `m * m`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, and `n * m`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values.
