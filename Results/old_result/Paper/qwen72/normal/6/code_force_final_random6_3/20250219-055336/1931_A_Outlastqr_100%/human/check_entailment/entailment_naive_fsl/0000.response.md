Correctness: **False**.

Explanation of the incorrectness:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain values of `n`.

For example, consider the input `n = 51`:
- According to the program, the output will be `azz` because `51 > 27` and `51 - 28 = 23`, so the second letter is `w` and the third letter is `z`. Thus, the output is `awz`.
- However, the lexicographically smallest word that sums to 51 is `ayy` (1 + 25 + 25 = 51).

The program also fails for other values, such as `n = 50`:
- The program outputs `avy` (1 + 22 + 27 = 50).
- The correct output should be `ayx` (1 + 25 + 24 = 50).

These examples show that the program does not always generate the lexicographically smallest word for the given `n`, hence it is incorrect.
