To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop `for i in range(1, n + 1):` will execute if `n` is at least 1, but since `n` is given to be in the range `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3`, the loop will always execute at least once. However, the initial state of `i` is given as `n`, which is not correct for the loop to start properly. The loop should start with `i` being 1.

Let's break it down:
- `n` is already within the valid range (2 to 10^3), so it does not need to be adjusted.
- `i` must be set to 1 for the loop to start correctly.

The state `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 49) and is now `t - 2` with `t` being at least 0, but this state does not affect the loop's execution and is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 49) and is now `t - 2` with `t` being at least 0, `n` is a new input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), `i` is 1**
