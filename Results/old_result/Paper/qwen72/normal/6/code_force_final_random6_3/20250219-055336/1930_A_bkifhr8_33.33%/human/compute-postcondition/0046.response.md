To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(n * 2):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n * 2`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is greater than `n * 2`
- `i` is 0
- `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`
- `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0
- `l` is the new input string
- `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter
- If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers, and the first and third elements of `lst` have been removed
- If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the minimum of the two integers in `lst`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- `n` must remain the same, as it is the input and does not change within the loop.

The other variables (`t`, `ans_f`, `l`, `lst`, and `ans`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is greater than `n * 2`, `i` is 1, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers, and the first and third elements of `lst` have been removed. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the minimum of the two integers in `lst`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
