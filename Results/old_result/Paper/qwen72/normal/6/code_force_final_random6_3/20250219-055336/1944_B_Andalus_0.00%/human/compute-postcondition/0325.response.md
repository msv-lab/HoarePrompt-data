Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements and must have at least 1 element.
   - `sz` is 0.
   - The loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each.
   - The loop has also printed the first `min(k - (2 * min(k // 2, len(ldb))), len(sng))` elements of `sng`.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop has been exited.
   - `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, meaning that at least 2 more elements can be printed without exceeding `k`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is inside a loop, and it prints `elem` twice, followed by a space.
   - The variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we can infer that it must be an element from `rdb` because the loop is still running and `rdb` is the only list mentioned that has elements to print.
   - Since `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop can print at least 2 more elements without exceeding `k`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will print the next element from `rdb` twice, followed by a space.
   - The exact value of `elem` is not provided, but it is an element from the `rdb` list.

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where elem is the next element from the rdb list)**
