Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`, `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`**

Explanation: The code `x = s.count('map')` updates the value of `x` to the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s`. The values of `y` and `z` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code. The other variables (`int(input())`, `_`, `a`, `s`) also remain unchanged.
