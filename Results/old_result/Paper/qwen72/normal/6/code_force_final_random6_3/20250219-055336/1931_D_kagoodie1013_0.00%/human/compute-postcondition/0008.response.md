Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the first tuple and must have at least one element, `results` is an empty list, `count` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_x` is `-num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `count` is incremented by the sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`.
- Since `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are both empty dictionaries, the values `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` are both 0.
- Therefore, `count` is incremented by 0, so its new value remains 0.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
