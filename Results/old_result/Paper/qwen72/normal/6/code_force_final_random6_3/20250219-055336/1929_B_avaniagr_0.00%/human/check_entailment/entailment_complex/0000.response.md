### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` reads from the standard input, which is appropriate for the problem statement.
   - It skips the first line (which contains the number of test cases) and processes each subsequent line.
   - Each line is split into two integers `n` and `k`, which are the size of the grid and the number of diagonals that need to have at least one colored cell, respectively.

2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The calculation is based on the value of `k`:
     - If `k` is less than `4 * n - 3`, the function prints `(k // 2 + k % 2)`.
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to `4 * n - 3`, the function prints `2 * n` plus 1 if `k` equals `4 * n - 2`.

3. **Correctness of the Calculation**:
   - For `k < 4 * n - 3`, the formula `(k // 2 + k % 2)` is used. This formula essentially rounds up `k / 2` to the nearest integer, which is the minimum number of cells needed to cover `k` diagonals. This is because each colored cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal).
   - For `k >= 4 * n - 3`, the formula `2 * n` is used. This is because when `k` is close to the maximum number of diagonals (`4 * n - 2`), it is more efficient to color the cells along the main and anti-diagonals, which will cover `2 * n` diagonals.
   - If `k` equals `4 * n - 2`, an additional cell is needed to cover the last diagonal, hence the `+ 1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2` by adding 1 to the result.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where `k` is less than `4 * n - 3` by using the rounding up logic.

5. **Input and Output**:
   - The function processes the input as described in the problem statement and prints the correct output for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
