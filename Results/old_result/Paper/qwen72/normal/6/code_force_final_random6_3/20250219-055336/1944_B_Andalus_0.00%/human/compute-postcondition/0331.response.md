To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements and must have at least 2 elements.
   - `sz` is 2.
   - The loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each.
   - The loop has also printed the first `min(k - (2 * min(k // 2, len(ldb))), len(sng))` elements of `sng`.
   - If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is increased by 2, and the loop has printed the next 2 elements.
   - If `k - sz` is less than 2, then `sz` remains 2, and no additional elements are printed.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop has been exited.
   - If `sz` is less than `k`, the loop continues to execute.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement is inside a loop that is printing elements.
   - The loop has already printed some elements based on the conditions provided.
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space.

4. **Determine `elem`**:
   - The value of `elem` is not explicitly given, but it is implied that `elem` is an element from the `rdb` list.
   - Since `rdb` contains duplicates of elements from `rgt`, `elem` will be one of these duplicate elements.

5. **Determine the Output**:
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space.
   - The exact value of `elem` is not specified, but it is known to be a duplicate element from the `rdb` list.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is a duplicate element from the `rdb` list)**
