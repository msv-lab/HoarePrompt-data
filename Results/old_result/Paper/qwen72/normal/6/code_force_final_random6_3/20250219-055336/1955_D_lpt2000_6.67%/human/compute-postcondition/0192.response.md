The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. Additionally, it accepts two lists of integers, `a` and `b`, where `a` has `n` elements and `b` has `m` elements, and each element in `a` and `b` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6.

The function returns a value based on the following cases:
- Case_1: If `k` is less than 1 or greater than `m`, or if `m` is less than 1 or greater than `n`, or if `n` is less than 1 or greater than 2 · 10^5, the function returns an error message indicating invalid input.
- Case_2: If the elements in `a` or `b` are not within the range 1 to 10^6, the function returns an error message indicating invalid input.
- Case_3: If the input is valid, the function returns a specific result based on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. It returns an error message if the parameters do not meet the constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6. If the input is valid, it returns a specific result based on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.**
