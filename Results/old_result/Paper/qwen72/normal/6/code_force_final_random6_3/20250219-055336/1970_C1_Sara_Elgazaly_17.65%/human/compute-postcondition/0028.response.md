The variable in the loop head is `lst[x]`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `lst[x]`. If `lst[x]` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lst[x]` is one element shorter and still contains at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `lst[x]` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 2Ã—10^5, `_` is `x - 2`, `a` and `b` are input integers, `lst[a]` is a list that now includes `b` `x - 1` times, `lst[b]` is a list that now includes `a` `x - 1` times, `s` is True, `lst[x]` is now one element shorter and still contains at least one element, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the execution.**
