Output State: **The program returns nothing.** 

In the initial state, `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n`, and no integer in `p` is equal to its index, and all integers in `p` are distinct. `v` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements initialized to some input values, and `i` is 3. The condition `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i` is given, so the program does not return any value.
