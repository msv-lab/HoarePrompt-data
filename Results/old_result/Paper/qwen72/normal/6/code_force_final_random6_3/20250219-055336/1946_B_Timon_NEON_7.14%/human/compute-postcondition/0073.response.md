Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a list `total_max_segment` that contains the sum of the maximum segment of positive integers found in `arr`, along with the starting and ending indices of this segment. If no such segment exists (i.e., all elements in `arr` are negative), the function returns `[-1]`. **
