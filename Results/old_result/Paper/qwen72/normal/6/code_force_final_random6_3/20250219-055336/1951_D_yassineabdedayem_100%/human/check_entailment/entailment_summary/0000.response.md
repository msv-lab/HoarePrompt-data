Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **First Condition (`n == k`)**:
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. This is correct because Alice will spend all `n` coins to buy `k` jewels, and since `n == k`, she will buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - The program prints 'YES', followed by 1 and 1, which is correct.

3. **Second Condition (`n + 2 > k * 2`)**:
   - This condition is intended to check if it is possible to set up two stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The condition `n + 2 > k * 2` simplifies to `n > 2 * k - 2`.
   - If `n > 2 * k - 2`, Bob can set up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and 1. Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling `k` jewels.
   - The program prints 'YES', followed by 2, and the prices `n - k + 1` and 1, which is correct.

4. **Third Condition (Else Case)**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'NO'. This is correct because if `n <= 2 * k - 2`, it is impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels without exceeding the constraints.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, if `n` is very small compared to `k`, it will correctly print 'NO'.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where `n` is exactly `k`, as well as the case where `n` is slightly larger than `2 * k - 2`.

6. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the problem description. For each test case, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' followed by the required number of stalls and their prices if the answer is 'YES'.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
