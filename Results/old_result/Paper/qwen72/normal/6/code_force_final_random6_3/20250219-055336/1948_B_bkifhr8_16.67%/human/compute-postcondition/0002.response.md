The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, inclusive. After executing the function body, if the list `lst` is already sorted in ascending order, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` of integers (each between 0 and 99) and returns `True` if `lst` is sorted in ascending order. If `lst` is not sorted in ascending order, it returns `False`.**
