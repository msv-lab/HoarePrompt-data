You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, and then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function concludes, `t` is the number of times `func_1` was called, and the final state of the program includes the side effects of `func_1` being called `t` times.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Input Handling in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to read a binary string `s` from the input.
   - However, the line `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` is incorrect. This line assumes that the input is a space-separated list of integers, which is not the case for a binary string. The correct way to read a binary string is `s = input().strip()`.
   - After reading the string, it should be converted to a list of integers for further processing, which can be done using `s = list(map(int, s))`.

3. **Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes `n` to 0, which is used to count the number of 1s encountered.
   - It also initializes `ans` to 0, which is used to accumulate the total cost.
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - If the character is 1, it increments `n`.
   - If the character is 0 and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. This is because the cost of cyclically shifting a substring of length `n + 1` (where `n` is the number of 1s and 1 is the 0) is `n + 1`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the cost is correct. The idea is to count the number of 1s and then, whenever a 0 is encountered, add the cost of shifting the substring containing the 1s and the 0.
   - However, the input handling in `func_1` is incorrect, which will cause the program to fail on actual test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the incorrect input handling in `func_1`. The function `func_1` should read the binary string as a single string and then convert it to a list of integers.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1():
    s = input().strip()  # Read the binary string
    s = list(map(int, s))  # Convert the string to a list of integers
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```
