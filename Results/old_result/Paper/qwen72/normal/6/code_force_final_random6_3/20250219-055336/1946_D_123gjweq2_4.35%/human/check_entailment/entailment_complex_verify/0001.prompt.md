You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `find_max` accepts a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` such that 0 <= bit < 30.

Otherwise, it processes the list to create a new list `new_arr` containing cumulative XOR values of elements in `cur_arr` that had the bit at position `bit` set to 0 at the time of their XOR operation. The function then returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`, unless the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is set to 1, in which case it returns -1.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments `[l_1, r_1]`, `[l_2, r_2]`, ..., `[l_k, r_k]` such that:
     - `l_1 = 1`
     - `r_k = n`
     - `l_i <= r_i` for all `i` from 1 to `k`
     - `r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1}` for all `i` from 1 to `k - 1`
     - The bitwise OR of the XOR results of each segment is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(arr, x)`**:
     - This function calls `find_max(arr, 31)`. The choice of 31 is likely because the maximum value of `x` is less than `2^30`, so the highest bit to consider is the 30th bit (0-indexed), and 31 is the next bit.
   
   - **`find_max(cur_arr, bit)`**:
     - **Base Case**:
       - If `bit == -1`, it returns the length of `cur_arr`. This means we have considered all bits from 30 down to 0, and the length of the current array `cur_arr` is the number of segments that satisfy the condition.
     - **Recursive Case**:
       - It initializes `new_arr` and `xor` to 0.
       - It iterates through `cur_arr` and computes the running XOR of the elements.
       - If the current bit (bit `bit`) of the running XOR is not set (i.e., `xor >> bit & 1` is 0), it appends the current XOR to `new_arr` and resets `xor` to 0.
       - After the loop, if the current bit of the final `xor` is set, it sets `thing1` to -1, indicating that the current segment cannot be split further.
       - If the current bit of `x` is not set (i.e., `x >> bit & 1` is 0), it returns `thing1`.
       - If the current bit of `x` is set, it returns the maximum of:
         - The result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)`, which considers the next bit.
         - The length of `new_arr`, which represents the number of valid segments formed by the current bit.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `find_max` is designed to recursively check each bit from the highest to the lowest.
   - It correctly handles the base case when all bits have been considered.
   - It correctly splits the array into segments based on the current bit and checks if the segments can be valid.
   - The logic for handling the current bit of `x` and the running XOR is sound.
   - The function ensures that the segments are contiguous and start from the beginning and end at the end of the array.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function should handle cases where `x` is 0 or the array `arr` is all zeros.
   - The function should handle cases where no valid segments can be formed, returning -1.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The function has a time complexity of \(O(n \log x)\), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
