### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, which is incorrect because it should take the number of test cases `t` and the arrays `a` for each test case as parameters. However, since the function is called within a loop that reads the number of test cases and the array for each test case, this part of the program is functionally correct, even though it is not the best practice.

2. **Checking if All Elements Are the Same:**
   - The function uses a flag `flag` to check if all elements in the array are the same. If all elements are the same, the flag remains `True`, and the function prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - This logic is correct for the given problem description.

3. **Finding the Minimum Consecutive Subarray Length:**
   - The function initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and `val` to the first element of the array. It then iterates through the array to count the length of consecutive subarrays where the elements are equal to `val`.
   - If a different element is found, it updates `ans` to the minimum of the current `ans` and the count of consecutive elements `cnt`.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to account for the last subarray of consecutive elements.
   - This logic is correct for finding the minimum length of consecutive subarrays where the elements are equal to the first element.

4. **Output:**
   - If the flag is `True`, it prints `-1` because all elements are the same.
   - If the flag is `False`, it prints `ans`, which is the minimum length of consecutive subarrays where the elements are equal to the first element.
   - The output is correct based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem as described. It checks if all elements are the same and prints `-1` if they are. Otherwise, it finds the minimum length of consecutive subarrays where the elements are equal to the first element and prints this length. The logic and execution states are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
