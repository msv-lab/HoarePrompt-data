The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of the `range(int(input()))` function call. For the loop to execute, the `range` function must generate a sequence of numbers, which means the input provided to `range` must be greater than 0.

Since the state before the loop starts specifies that `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, and this `n` is expected to be the input to the `range` function, we need to ensure that the input provided is within this range. However, the input is taken dynamically during the loop's execution, so we cannot directly adjust `n` in the state. Instead, we need to ensure that the input provided will be a valid integer within the specified range.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer, and for it to be consistent with the program's expectations, it should be within the range 3 to 78. The variable `i` will start at 0, as is typical for a `range` loop.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `i` is 0, and the input to `range` must be an integer within the range 3 to 78**
