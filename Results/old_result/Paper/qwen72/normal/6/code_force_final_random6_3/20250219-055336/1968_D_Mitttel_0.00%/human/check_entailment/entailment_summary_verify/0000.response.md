### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function takes the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
   - It calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function.
   - It then compares the scores and returns "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if the scores are equal.
   - The logic here is straightforward and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function 2 (`calculate_score`)**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting at a given position.
   - It initializes the score to 0 and the current position to the starting position.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to track the positions visited and the number of steps taken to reach them.
   - It iterates up to `k` steps, adding the score at each position and moving to the next position according to the permutation `p`.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., the current position has been visited before), it calculates the cycle length and the score within the cycle.
   - It then adds the score for the remaining steps by completing full cycles and then the remaining steps within the cycle.
   - This function correctly handles the cycle detection and score calculation, which is crucial for the game's mechanics.

3. **Function 3 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes it to handle multiple test cases.
   - It extracts the parameters for each test case and calls `func_1` with these parameters.
   - It collects the results and prints them.
   - The function correctly reads and processes the input format specified in the problem description.

### Validation of Original Assessment:

- **Cycle Detection and Score Calculation**:
  - The `calculate_score` function correctly identifies cycles and calculates the score for the remaining steps within the cycle. This is essential for handling large values of `k` efficiently.
  - The function ensures that the score is computed accurately by following the rules of the game.

- **Input and Output Handling**:
  - The `func_2` function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases, which is consistent with the problem's input and output requirements.
  - It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program appears to handle all edge cases, such as when the starting positions are the same, when the permutation is a simple cycle, and when `k` is very large.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, handles the game mechanics, and processes the input and output as required. There are no apparent issues with the cycle detection, score calculation, or the handling of multiple test cases.

Final: **True**
