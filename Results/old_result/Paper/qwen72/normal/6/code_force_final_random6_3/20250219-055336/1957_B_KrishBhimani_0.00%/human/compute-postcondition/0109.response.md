Output State: **`arr` is an empty list or contains `[0]` depending on whether `k0` was odd, and if `k` is odd, `arr` is updated to `[1]` if `k0` was odd or `[0, 1]` if `k0` was even. `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is `k0` right-shifted by 2 bits and must be non-zero, `i` is 1, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, and `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by right-shifting `k0` by 1 bit, and then right-shifting the result by another 1 bit, effectively right-shifting `k0` by 2 bits.
- The other variables (`arr`, `n`, `i`, `k0`, `c`, `ans`, `l1`) remain unchanged.
