It seems there was a mistake in the function definition provided. Based on the problem description, the function should take the number of test cases, the number of piles, and the list of piles as inputs. Here is the corrected function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```
def game_winner(t, n, piles):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and piles is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
