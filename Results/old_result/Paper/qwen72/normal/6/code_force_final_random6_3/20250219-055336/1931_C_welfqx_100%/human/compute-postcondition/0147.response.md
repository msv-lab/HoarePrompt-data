The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but the execution of the program will proceed to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of `num` that are equal, up to `n - 1`, `cn` is increased by `ck` if `symb1` and `symb2` are equal, `r` is `t - 1`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1 if all elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is `n - 2`, and either `n` is 1 or `f` is 1. The current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
