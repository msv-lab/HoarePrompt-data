### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - If all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same, it is impossible to distribute the coins to meet the requirement because the total amount received back for any winning outcome would be the same as the total amount bet.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** This function correctly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - It reads the number of outcomes \( N \) and the list of multipliers \( k_i \).
     - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier and then iteratively calculates the LCM of `den` and each multiplier in the list.
     - It computes `vprod` as the list of integer divisions of `den` by each multiplier.
     - It checks if `den - sum(vprod)` is less than or equal to 0. If so, it prints \(-1\) and returns.
     - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string.

3. **Evaluating the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the program does not correctly handle the case where all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same.
   - Let's consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
     ```
     2
     5
     5 5 5 5 5
     ```
   - The program will calculate the LCM of all 5s, which is 5.
   - It will then compute `vprod` as `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` because \( 5 // 5 = 1 \).
   - The total amount bet is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 \).
   - The program will check if \( 5 - 5 \leq 0 \), which is true, and will print \(-1\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly identifies that it is impossible to distribute the coins when all multipliers are the same and prints \(-1\).
   - The original assessment is incorrect because the program does handle the case where all multipliers are the same and correctly outputs \(-1\).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
