The function `func_1` does not explicitly define any parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and the context, it is implied that the function operates on a set of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers. The constraints for these parameters are as follows: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i ≠ i, and all `p_i` are distinct.

The function `func_1` returns nothing in all cases. This suggests that the function is designed to perform some operations or checks on the input data but does not produce a return value. Instead, it might modify some external state, print results, or handle the data in a way that does not require returning a value.

Functionality: **The function accepts an implicit set of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list `p` of `n` integers where each `p_i` is between 1 and `n`, `p_i` ≠ i, and all `p_i` are distinct. The function performs operations on these inputs but does not return any value.**
