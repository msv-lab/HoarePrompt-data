Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is equal to `a[0]` or `a[0] + dif` depending on the condition, `ans_list` contains `a[0]` and `a[0]`, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `res` is equal to `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `i` is 0, and `dif` is not 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
