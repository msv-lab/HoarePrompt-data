The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `0`.**
