Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `steps` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are the last set of integers provided by the user, `n` is equal to (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f), `x` is equal to (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h). If `x` > `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations:
- The variable `t` remains the same as the initial value provided, which is an integer between 1 and 100.
- The variable `steps` is now `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all but the last iteration.
- The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` hold the values of the last set of coordinates provided by the user.
- The variable `n` is calculated as the squared Euclidean distance between the coordinates `(a, b)` and `(e, f)`.
- The variable `x` is calculated as the squared Euclidean distance between the coordinates `(c, d)` and `(g, h)`.
- The loop will print the smaller of `n` and `x` for each iteration. After the last iteration, `n` and `x` will be the last calculated values based on the last set of coordinates provided.
