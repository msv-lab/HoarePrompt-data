Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0, 1, 1, or 2, `r` is n - 1, n - 2, n - 2, or n - 3, and `sunks` is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. If `k` == 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `a[l] <= a[r]` and `k` >= `a[l] * 2`, then `l` is updated to 1, 2, 2, or 3, `sunks` is updated to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10, `k` is updated to `k - a[l-1] * 2`, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l-1]`. If `a[r]` == 0, `r` is updated to n - 2, n - 3, n - 3, or n - 4, and `sunks` is updated to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11. If `l` == `r` and `k` >= `a[r]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` < `a[l] * 2` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[l] > a[r]`, the values of `l`, `r`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `sunks` remain unchanged.***
