The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `num`. The loop iterates backward from `len(num) - 1` to `0`, decrementing `i` by 1 each time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(num) - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 to `len(num) - 2`.

Since the loop condition is `i` being greater than or equal to `0`, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is not less than `0`. The state of `num` does not change in the loop head, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`num` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9, and the length of `num` is an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `m` is an integer (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6), `i` is `len(num) - 2`, `counter` is 0 or 1 depending on the previous iteration's outcome**
