You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
    print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, each test case consists of n (2 <= n <= 50) and a list p of n integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements initialized to the input values, `i` is `n`. If `v[v[i]]` is equal to `i` for any `i` in the range 1 to `n`, the program prints 2 and returns. Otherwise, the program returns nothing.
    print(3)
    #This is printed: - The code will execute the `else` block and print `3`.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` implicitly processes a set of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list `p` of `n` integers where each `p_i` is between 1 and `n`, `p_i` ≠ i, and all `p_i` are distinct. It checks if there exists any index `i` in the range 1 to `n` such that `p[p[i]]` is equal to `i`. If such an index is found, the function prints `2` and returns. If no such index is found, the function prints `3` and returns. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `v`.

2. **Array Initialization:**
   - The array `v` is initialized with an extra element at the beginning (index 0) to make the indices 1-based, which aligns with the problem's description.

3. **Checking for Mutual Best Friends:**
   - The program iterates over each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - It checks if `v[v[i]] == i`, which means that friend `i` and friend `v[i]` are mutual best friends.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns immediately, as inviting both friends in this pair will ensure that both come to the party.

4. **Default Case:**
   - If no mutual best friends are found, the program prints `3` and returns.
   - This is based on the assumption that if no mutual best friends exist, the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Correctness of Mutual Best Friends Check:**
  - The condition `v[v[i]] == i` correctly identifies pairs of mutual best friends.
  - If such a pair is found, inviting both friends will ensure that both come to the party, which satisfies the requirement of having at least 2 friends at the party.

- **Default Case:**
  - The default case assumes that if no mutual best friends are found, the minimum number of invitations needed is 3.
  - This assumption is not always correct. For example, consider the case where `n = 4` and `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`. In this case, there are no mutual best friends, but inviting any 3 friends will still ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

### Counterexample:
- For the input:
  ```
  1
  4
  2 3 4 1
  ```
  - The program will print `3`, which is correct in this case.
  - However, for the input:
  ```
  1
  4
  2 1 4 3
  ```
  - The program will print `3`, but the correct answer should be `2` because friends 1 and 2 are mutual best friends, and inviting them will ensure both come to the party.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to identify situations where there are multiple pairs of mutual best friends or where the minimum number of invitations needed is less than 3 even if no mutual best friends are found.

### Correctness:
**False**
