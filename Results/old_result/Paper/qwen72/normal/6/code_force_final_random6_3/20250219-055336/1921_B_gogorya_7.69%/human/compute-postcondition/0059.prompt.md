Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`, `hd` is `a1 - a2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if hd > 0:
        hd -= 1
        continue
    if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 0, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', `res` is increased by 1 and `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1` if `hd` > 0, otherwise `hd` remains `a1 - a2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are input strings, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 1, and `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`. If `s1[1]` is '1' and `s2[1]` is '0', `res` is increased by 1 and `hd` is updated based on the conditions described in the initial state. Otherwise, `res` and `hd` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are input strings, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 2, and `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`. If `s1[2]` is '1' and `s2[2]` is '0', `res` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `hd` remains unchanged in all cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
