Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of input integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 1. `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element. `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and also not equal to their following element, provided `i` is less than `n - 1`. `rdb` remains an empty list.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The loop variable `i` will be `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has run from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`.
- The list `ldb` will contain all elements in `lft` that are duplicates of their preceding element.
- The list `sng` will contain all elements in `lft` that are not duplicates of their preceding element and also not duplicates of their following element, as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.
- The list `rdb` will remain empty, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`) will retain their initial values, as they are not affected by the loop.
