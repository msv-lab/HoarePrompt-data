    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is n or a value such that `a[l]` is greater than `k` and `r` is less than `l` or a value such that `a[r]` is greater than `k`, `sunks` is the total number of successful operations performed, where each operation either subtracts `2 * a[l]` from `k` and updates `a[r]` or subtracts `2 * a[r]` from `k` and updates `a[l]`, and increments `sunks` by 1 or 2 depending on the conditions.

    #The program returns the total number of successful operations performed, `sunks`, where each operation either subtracts `2 * a[l]` from `k` and updates `a[r]` or subtracts `2 * a[r]` from `k` and updates `a[l]`, and increments `sunks` by 1 or 2 depending on the conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `k` (a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15), and `a` (a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9). It returns the total number of successful operations performed, `sunks`. Each operation either subtracts `2 * a[l]` from `k` and updates `a[r]` by subtracting `a[l]` from it, or subtracts `2 * a[r]` from `k` and updates `a[l]` by subtracting `a[r]` from it. The function continues performing these operations until `k` is less than the value required for the next operation or until the pointers `l` and `r` meet or cross each other. The final state of the program is that `k` is reduced by the total amount subtracted during the operations, and the elements in `a` are updated accordingly. The function increments `sunks` by 1 for each successful operation and by 2 in specific cases where the operation exactly matches `k`.
