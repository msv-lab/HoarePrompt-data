To determine what will be printed when the `print(c)` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `x` is `n-1`.
   - `a` is the smallest value in the list `l`.
   - `b` is the second smallest value in the list `l`.
   - `c` is the number of elements in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `x` is `n-1`, which means `x` is also a positive integer (since `n` is greater than 0).
   - `a` is the smallest value in the list `l`.
   - `b` is the second smallest value in the list `l`.
   - `c` is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

3. **Determining the Value of `c`**:
   - To find `c`, we need to count how many elements in the list `l` are greater than both `a` and `b`.
   - Since `a` is the smallest value and `b` is the second smallest value, any element in `l` that is greater than `b` will automatically be greater than `a`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The value of `c` will be the number of elements in `l` that are greater than the second smallest value `b`.

Therefore, the `print(c)` statement will output the number of elements in the list `l` that are greater than the second smallest value in `l`.

Output: **c (where c is the number of elements in the list `l` that are greater than the second smallest value in `l`)**
