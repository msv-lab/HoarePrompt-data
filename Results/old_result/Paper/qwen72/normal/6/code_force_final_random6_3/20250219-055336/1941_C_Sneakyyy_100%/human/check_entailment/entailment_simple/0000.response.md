### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `a`.

2. **Loop to Find Substrings**: The program uses a `while` loop to iterate through the string `a` and check for the substrings "map" and "pie". The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, which ensures that there are at least 3 characters left to form a substring.

3. **Substring Check and Deletion Count**: Inside the loop, the program extracts a substring of length 3 starting from index `i`. If the substring is either "map" or "pie", it increments `i` by 3 and increases the deletion count `ans` by 1. This is because removing one character from a "map" or "pie" substring will make the string beautiful, and the next potential substring to check will start 3 characters ahead.

4. **Output**: After the loop completes, the program prints the deletion count `ans` for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string does not contain "map" or "pie", `ans` remains 0, which is the correct output.
   - If the string contains multiple occurrences of "map" or "pie", the program correctly counts and removes the minimum number of characters.

6. **Efficiency**: The program efficiently handles the constraints, as it iterates through the string in a linear manner, ensuring that the time complexity is O(n) for each test case, where n is the length of the string.

### Correctness:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases. It correctly identifies and counts the minimum number of characters to be removed to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
