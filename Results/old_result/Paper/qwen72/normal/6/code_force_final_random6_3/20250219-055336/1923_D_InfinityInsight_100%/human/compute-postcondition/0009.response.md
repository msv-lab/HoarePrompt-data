The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If `a[2]` is not equal to `a[1]`, `last` is a list that now contains the value 2. If `a[2]` is equal to `a[1]`, `last` has one more element, which is the same as its previous last element.**
