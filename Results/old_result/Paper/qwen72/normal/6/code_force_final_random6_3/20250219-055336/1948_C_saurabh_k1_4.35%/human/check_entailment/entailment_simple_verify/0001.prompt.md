You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t (an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n (where each n is even and 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a list of tuples (each containing two strings of length n with characters '<' or '>'), representing the arrows in the grid for each test case.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. `_` is equal to the number of test cases minus 1, `n` is the last input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4), `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the last input, and `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the last input. If the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`, then the condition is met and 'No' is printed. Otherwise, the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is not the string `"<"` and 'Yes' is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and needs to reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot can move left, right, up, or down, but it cannot move outside the grid.
   - After each move, the robot follows the direction of the arrow in the current cell.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case provides the grid size \( n \) and the arrows in the two rows.
   - The output should be "YES" if the robot can reach (2, n) and "NO" otherwise.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The robot must eventually move to the second row to reach (2, n).
   - The robot can only move to the second row by moving down from the first row.
   - Once in the second row, the robot must be able to move to the right to reach (2, n).

4. **Critical Condition:**
   - The robot can only move to the second row if there is a cell in the first row where the arrow points down (i.e., the robot can move from (1, i) to (2, i)).
   - Once in the second row, the robot must be able to move to the right to reach (2, n). This means that the cell (2, n-1) must have an arrow pointing to the right (i.e., `b[n-2]` must be `>`).

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size \( n \) and the arrows in the two rows.
   - The program checks if the arrow in the cell (2, n-1) (i.e., `b[n-2]`) is pointing to the right (`>`).
   - If `b[n-2]` is `<`, it prints "No" (indicating the robot cannot reach (2, n)).
   - If `b[n-2]` is `>`, it prints "Yes" (indicating the robot can reach (2, n)).

6. **Flaws in the Program:**
   - The program only checks the arrow in the cell (2, n-1). It does not consider whether the robot can actually move to the second row from the first row.
   - The robot must be able to move down from the first row to the second row at some point. This means there must be a cell (1, i) where the arrow points down (i.e., `a[i-1]` must be `v` or `b[i-1]` must be `^`), but the program does not check for this condition.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it only checks the direction of the arrow in the cell (2, n-1) and does not verify if the robot can move to the second row from the first row. Therefore, it may produce incorrect results in cases where the robot cannot move to the second row.

### Correctness:
**False**
