Postcondition: ***`t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + n + 3`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is a list containing a single string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each `v[x]` (for each `x` read from `data` starting from index `n + 3` to `n + n + 2`) is incremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 2]` and must be greater than 0, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[n + n + 2]`, `_` is `n - 1`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated to `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`, and `v[i]` remains greater than or equal to 3. Otherwise, `v[i]` is less than 3.***
