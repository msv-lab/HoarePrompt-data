The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `d` within the range of 0 to n-1, where n is the number of vertices in a graph. It prints a query string in the format `? d` to the standard output and then reads two integers `v` and `u` from the user input. The function returns these two integers `v` and `u`. After the function concludes, the program has printed the query and received and returned the two integers provided by the user.
