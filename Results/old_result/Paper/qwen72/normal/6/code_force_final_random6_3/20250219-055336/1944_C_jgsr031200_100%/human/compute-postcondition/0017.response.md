Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`.
   - The length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5.
   - `freq` is a list where each element at index `i` corresponds to the number of times the integer `i` appears in `arr`.
   - `cou` is 1 if `freq[i]` is 1, otherwise `cou` remains 0.
   - `n` must be at least 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The current value of `freq[i]` is either 1 or greater than or equal to 2.
   - Additionally, either `cou` is 2 or `freq[i]` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 0 in the initial state.
   - The value of `i` does not change in the code snippet.
   - Therefore, the `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 0.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The value of `i` is 0.

Output: **0**
