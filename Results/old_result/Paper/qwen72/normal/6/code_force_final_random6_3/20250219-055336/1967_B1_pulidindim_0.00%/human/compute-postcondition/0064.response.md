Output State: **`t` is a specific positive integer provided by the user and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `count` is equal to `m + 1`, `ans` is equal to `n + Î£((n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1) for k from 2 to m`, where `k` is the loop counter starting from 2 and incrementing by 1 each iteration.**

Explanation:
- The values of `t`, `i`, `count`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user through the `input()` function.
