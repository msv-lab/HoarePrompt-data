Output State: **`arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 3, `ans` is a list containing three elements which are `1 << i`, `1 << i`, and `1 << i`.**

The code `ans.append(1 << i)` adds another element to the list `ans`, which is the value of `1 << i`. Since `i` is the third element of `arr`, and `ans` initially contains two elements both equal to `1 << i`, after the code execution, `ans` now contains three elements, all of which are `1 << i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
