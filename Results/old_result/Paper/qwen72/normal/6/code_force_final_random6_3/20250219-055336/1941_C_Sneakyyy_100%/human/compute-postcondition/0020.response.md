Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string with length greater than 8, `s` is the substring of `a` from index 6 to index 8 (inclusive), `ans` is 2, `i` is 6**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to be the substring of `a` starting from index 6 to index 8 (inclusive).
- The values of `n`, `a`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The length of `a` is still greater than 8, and `n` is still an integer greater than 0.
