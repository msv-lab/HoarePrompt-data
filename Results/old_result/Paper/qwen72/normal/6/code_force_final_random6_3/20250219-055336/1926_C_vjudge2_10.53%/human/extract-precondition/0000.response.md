Precondition: **The function `func_1` should actually be defined with an input parameter `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) provided before the individual test cases.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func_1(n):
```

For the purpose of this task, I will provide the precondition based on the correct function definition:

Precondition: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.**
