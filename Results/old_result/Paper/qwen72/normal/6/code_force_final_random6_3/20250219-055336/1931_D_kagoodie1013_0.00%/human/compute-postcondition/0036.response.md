Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the second tuple and must have at least one element, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the result of `-num % x`.**

Explanation:
- `mod_x` is calculated as `-num % x`. This means `mod_x` will be the remainder when `-num` is divided by `x`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
