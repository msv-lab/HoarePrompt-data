The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('No')
```

Based on the initial state:
- `_` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input.
- `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input.
- If the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is not the string `"<"`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('No')
```

This statement will print the string `'No'` regardless of the values of `_`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. The condition described in the initial state does not affect the execution of this `print` statement because it is not part of any conditional logic in the provided code snippet.

Output: **No**
