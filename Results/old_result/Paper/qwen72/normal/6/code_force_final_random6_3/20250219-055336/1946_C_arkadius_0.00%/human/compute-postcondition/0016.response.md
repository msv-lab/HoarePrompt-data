Output State: **`tree` is an instance of the Tree class representing a tree with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `k` < `n`, `mid` is `(beg + end + 1) // 2`, `beg` is now equal to `mid`, and `beg` must be less than `end`.**

The value of `beg` is updated to be equal to `mid`, which is calculated as `(beg + end + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition that `beg` must be less than `end` still holds.
