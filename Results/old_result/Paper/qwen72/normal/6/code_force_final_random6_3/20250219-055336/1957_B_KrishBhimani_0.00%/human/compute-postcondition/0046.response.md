Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the first integer from `l1`.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `k0` is the second integer from `l1` and must be greater than or equal to the number of bits in `k`.
   - `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits in the original `k` that were set to 1.
   - `ans` is a list containing the elements `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`.
   - If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, the last element in `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)` before the final append.
   - `c` is equal to `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking early, otherwise `c` is less than `n - 1`.
   - `ans` has been extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` is the first integer from `l1`, which means `n` is the number of elements in the final `ans` list.
   - `k` is initialized to 0, so initially, `arr` (which contains the indices of the bits set to 1 in `k`) will be an empty list.
   - `k0` is the second integer from `l1` and must be greater than or equal to the number of bits in `k`. Since `k` is 0, `k0` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `arr` is an empty list because `k` is 0.
   - `ans` is a list that will be populated with elements `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr`. Since `arr` is empty, `ans` will start as an empty list.
   - The loop will run until `c` reaches `n - 1`. Since `arr` is empty, no elements will be added to `ans` from the loop.
   - If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, the last element in `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)`. Since `ans` is empty, `sum(ans)` is 0, so the last element will be `k0`.
   - `ans` will be extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.

3. **Constructing the `ans` List:**
   - Since `arr` is empty, no elements are added to `ans` from the loop.
   - If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, the last element in `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)`. Since `ans` is empty, `sum(ans)` is 0, so the last element will be `k0`.
   - `ans` will be extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.

4. **Final `ans` List:**
   - `ans` will be a list of length `n` with the last element being `k0` and all other elements being 0.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

Given the initial state and the construction of `ans`, the output will be a list of `n` elements where the last element is `k0` and all other elements are 0.

Output: **0 0 ... 0 k0 (where there are n-1 zeros and k0 is the second integer from l1)**
