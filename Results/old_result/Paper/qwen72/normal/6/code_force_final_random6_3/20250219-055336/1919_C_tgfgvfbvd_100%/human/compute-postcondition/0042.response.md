Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is `n-1`, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, and `c` is the number of elements in the new `l` that are greater than `b`.**

The values of `a` and `b` are now both set to `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. The other variables remain unchanged.
