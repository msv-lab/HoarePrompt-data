Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged. `b` now contains the first element of `lit`. If `b` is not empty, `x` is set to infinity, and `y` is set to the last element of `b`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`, and `y` is less than `lit[i]`. The current value of `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `x`.**
