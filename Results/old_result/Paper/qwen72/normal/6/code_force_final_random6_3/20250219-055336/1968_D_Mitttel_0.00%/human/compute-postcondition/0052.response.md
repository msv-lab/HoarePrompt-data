Output State: **`cycle_length` must be greater than 0, `cycle_score` is incremented by the value of `a[cycle_pos - 1]` for each iteration, `cycle_pos` is updated to `p[cycle_pos - 1]` after each iteration, the loop executes `cycle_length` times, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`.**

The code snippet `remaining_steps = k - steps` calculates the difference between `k` and `steps` and assigns this value to `remaining_steps`. The other variables and conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `remaining_steps` and the unchanged conditions for `cycle_length`, `cycle_score`, and `cycle_pos`.
