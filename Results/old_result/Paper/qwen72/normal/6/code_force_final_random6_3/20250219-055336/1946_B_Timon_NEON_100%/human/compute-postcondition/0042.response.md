Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is either an empty list or `[arr[1], 1]` based on the conditions described, `new_segment` is either an empty list or `[arr[1], 1]` based on the conditions described, `segments_variants` is updated with a new list that is `new_segment` plus `[1]`.**

Explanation:
- `max_segment` is now assigned the value of `new_segment`, which can be either an empty list or `[arr[1], 1]` based on the conditions described.
- The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `max_sum`, `new_segment`, and `segments_variants`) remain unchanged or retain their updated values from the initial state.
