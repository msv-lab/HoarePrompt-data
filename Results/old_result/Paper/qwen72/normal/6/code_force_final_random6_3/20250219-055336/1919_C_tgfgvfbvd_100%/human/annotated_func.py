#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the provided function definition does not include them. The correct function definition should include parameters `t` and `cases`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `cases` is a list of test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` of length `n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a, b = float('inf'), float('inf')
        
        c = 0
        
        for x in range(n):
            if a > b:
                a, b = b, a
            if l[x] <= a:
                a = l[x]
            elif l[x] <= b:
                b = l[x]
            else:
                a = l[x]
                c += 1
        
        print(c)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `_` is `int(input()) - 1`, and for each test case, `n` is the input integer greater than 0, `l` is the list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the smallest integer in `l`, `b` is the second smallest integer in `l` (if it exists), and `c` is the count of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the input. It then processes the list to find the smallest and second smallest integers, and counts how many integers in the list are greater than both of these values. Finally, it prints the count for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
