The given `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. There are no variables or objects being used in the `print` statement that require evaluation based on the initial state. The initial state provides information about `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s`, but none of these are directly involved in the `print` statement.

Output: **YES**
