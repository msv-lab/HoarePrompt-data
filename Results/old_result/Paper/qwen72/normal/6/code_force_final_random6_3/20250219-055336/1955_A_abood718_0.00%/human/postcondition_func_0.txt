The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it accepts three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` such that 1 <= A, B, C <= 30. The function prints a result for each test case based on the following conditions: if `B * 2 < C`, it prints `A * B`; if `A` is even, it prints `A * C / 2`; if `A` is odd and `B * 2 >= C`, it prints two lines, the first being `A // 2` and the second being `(A // 2) * C + B`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.
