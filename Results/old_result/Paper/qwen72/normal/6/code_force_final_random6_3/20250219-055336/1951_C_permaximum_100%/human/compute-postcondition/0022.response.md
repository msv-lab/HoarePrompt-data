Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. `pq` is a heap with one less element than before. `price` is the smallest price in the heap before the operation plus `price_increase`. `day` is the index of this smallest price in the `prices` list. `total_cost` is now `price * tickets_to_buy` plus the previous `total_cost`. `tickets_bought` is `tickets_bought + min(m, k - tickets_bought)`. `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)` updates the value of `tickets_to_buy` to the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `pq`, `price`, `day`, `total_cost`, `tickets_bought`, `price_increase`) remain unchanged or are still valid as per the initial state.
- The new value of `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`, which means `tickets_to_buy` is now the minimum of `m` and the remaining tickets that can be bought (`k - tickets_bought`).
