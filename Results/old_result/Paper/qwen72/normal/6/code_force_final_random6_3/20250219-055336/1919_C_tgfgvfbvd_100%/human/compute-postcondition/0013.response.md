Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is infinity, `b` is the element at index `x` in `l`, `c` is 0, `x` is 0. If `a` > `b`, `a` is equal to `b`. The element at index `x` in `l` is greater than `a`, and the element at index `x` in `l` is less than or equal to `b`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated to the element at index `x` in the list `l`.
- The element at index `x` in `l` is less than or equal to `b`, so after the assignment, `b` is equal to this element.
- The element at index `x` in `l` is also greater than `a`, but since `a` is infinity, this condition is always false, so `a` remains infinity.
- All other variables (`int(input())`, `_`, `n`, `c`, `x`) and conditions (`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is 0, `x` is 0) remain unchanged.
