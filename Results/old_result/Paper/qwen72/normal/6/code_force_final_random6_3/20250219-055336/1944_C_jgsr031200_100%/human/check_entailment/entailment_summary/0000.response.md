Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem by determining the MEX of the array `c` after both Alice and Bob have played optimally. The key idea is to understand the optimal strategy for both players and how it affects the MEX of the array `c`.

### Optimal Strategy:
- **Alice's Strategy:** Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`. To do this, she should try to ensure that the smallest possible integers are not included in `c` as much as possible, especially those that appear only once in `a`.
- **Bob's Strategy:** Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`. To do this, he should try to remove the smallest possible integers that are not yet in `c` or that appear only once in `a`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the frequency of each integer in `arr` using a list `freq` of size `n + 1`.
   - This is correct because the integers in `arr` are guaranteed to be in the range `[0, n-1]`.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through the integers from 0 to `n` and checks the frequency of each integer.
   - If an integer `i` appears at least twice, it is ignored because Alice can always pick it and Bob will not be able to prevent it from being in `c`.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once, a counter `cou` is incremented.
   - If `cou` reaches 2, it means that there are two unique integers in `arr`, and the MEX of `c` will be `i` because Alice and Bob can each pick one of these unique integers, ensuring that `i` is the smallest integer not in `c`.
   - If an integer `i` does not appear at all, it is printed as the MEX because both players will have played optimally, and `i` will be the smallest integer not in `c`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Array:** If `arr` contains a single element, the MEX will be 1 if the element is 0, and 0 otherwise. The program handles this correctly.
- **All Elements Unique:** If all elements in `arr` are unique, the MEX will be the smallest integer not in `arr`. The program correctly identifies this by checking the frequency of each integer.
- **All Elements Duplicate:** If all elements in `arr` appear at least twice, the MEX will be the smallest integer not in `arr`. The program correctly handles this by continuing to the next integer if the current one appears at least twice.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob and correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
