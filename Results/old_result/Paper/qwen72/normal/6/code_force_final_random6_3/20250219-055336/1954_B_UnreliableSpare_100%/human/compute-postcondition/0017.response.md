Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes without breaking, or the index at which `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i-1]` if the loop breaks, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to their previous element, otherwise `flag` is False, `ans` is Decimal('Infinity')**.
