Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. However, there are a few issues with the logic and the output format that need to be addressed:

1. **Condition for Regular Price vs. Promotion Price**:
   - The program checks if `B * 2 < C` to determine if buying individual yogurts is cheaper than the promotion. This is correct because if the regular price for two yogurts is less than the promotional price, it's better to buy them individually.

2. **Handling Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `A` (the number of yogurts) is even, the program calculates the total cost as `A * C / 2`. This is correct because you can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price.

3. **Handling Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `A` is odd, the program prints two lines: the first line is `A // 2` (which is the number of pairs of yogurts), and the second line is `(A // 2) * C + B` (which is the cost of buying `A // 2` pairs at the promotional price and one additional yogurt at the regular price). This is incorrect because the problem requires a single output for each test case, not two lines.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program should print a single integer for each test case, representing the minimum cost. The current implementation prints two lines for odd `A`, which violates the problem's output requirements.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect because it does not adhere to the specified output format for odd `A`.

Correctness: **False**
