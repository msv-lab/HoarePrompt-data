Reasoning:

The program is intended to maximize the product of two integers \( x \) and \( y \) by swapping their corresponding digits. However, the logic implemented in the `func_1` function is flawed. The function swaps the digits in the first half of the numbers to maximize the first number and minimize the second number, and it swaps the digits in the second half to minimize the first number and maximize the second number. This approach does not necessarily maximize the product of the two numbers.

To maximize the product of two numbers, the strategy should be to ensure that the largest digits are in the most significant positions of both numbers. The correct approach would involve:

1. Sorting the digits of both numbers in descending order.
2. Swapping the digits to ensure that the most significant digits of both numbers are as large as possible.

The current implementation does not follow this strategy. Instead, it only partially swaps the digits, which may not result in the maximum product. For example, if \( x = 3516 \) and \( y = 3982 \), the current implementation will produce \( x = 3912 \) and \( y = 3586 \), but the maximum product can be achieved by \( x = 9536 \) and \( y = 3912 \).

Additionally, the function `func_1` is not correctly handling the input and output for multiple test cases. The function should be called with the appropriate parameters for each test case, and the results should be printed for each test case.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
