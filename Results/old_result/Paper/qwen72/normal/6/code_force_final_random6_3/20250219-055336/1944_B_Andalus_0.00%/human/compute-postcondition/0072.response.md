Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `sng` is a list or sequence that must contain at least two elements.
- `elem` is the second element in `sng`.
- `sz` is a variable whose value is not explicitly given, but it is compared to `k`.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement will print the value of `elem`, which is the second element in the list `sng`.
- The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Output:
Since `elem` is the second element in `sng`, the `print` statement will output the value of the second element in `sng` followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the second element in the list sng)**
