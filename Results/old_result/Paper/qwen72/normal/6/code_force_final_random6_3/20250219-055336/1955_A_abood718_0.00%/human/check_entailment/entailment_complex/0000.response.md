Reasoning:
The program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Variable Naming**: The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` are used to represent `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. This is not a critical issue but can lead to confusion. For clarity, it would be better to use `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion Price Check**: The condition `if B * 2 < C` is correct. If the regular price for two yogurts (`2 * a`) is less than the promotional price (`b`), then it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price. The program correctly prints `A * B` in this case.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts**: The condition `elif A % 2 == 0` is also correct. If the number of yogurts `n` is even, then Maxim can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price. The program correctly prints `int(A * C / 2)` in this case.

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts**: The condition `else` is intended to handle the case where `n` is odd. However, the program prints two lines instead of one, which is incorrect. The correct approach should be to buy as many pairs as possible at the promotional price and then buy one additional yogurt at the regular price. The program should print `X * C + B` directly without the intermediate `print(X)`.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect because it prints an extra line when `n` is odd, which does not match the expected output format.

Correctness: **False**
