Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and equal to `t`, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is False, `i` is 0. If `i` is not a key in the `mpp` Counter object, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement.***
