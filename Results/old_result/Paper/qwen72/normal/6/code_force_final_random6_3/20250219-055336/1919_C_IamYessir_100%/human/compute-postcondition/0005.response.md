The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop and will start at 0.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0**
