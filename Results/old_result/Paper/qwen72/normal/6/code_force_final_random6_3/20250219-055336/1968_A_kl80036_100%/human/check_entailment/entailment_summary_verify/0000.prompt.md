You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer from the user input, which represents the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads another integer `x` from the user input, where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and prints `x - 1`. After the function concludes, the program state includes the number of iterations completed and the printed values, which are each one less than the corresponding input integers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `x` is a prime number correctly. When `x` is a prime number, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and any `y` (1 ≤ y < x) is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of `gcd(x, y) + y` would be `1 + (x - 1) = x`. However, the program always outputs `x - 1`, which is correct for prime numbers but not necessarily for composite numbers.

For example, consider `x = 10`. The program outputs `9`, but the GCD of `10` and `9` is `1`, so `gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 10`. However, for `y = 5`, `gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7`, which is not the maximum possible value. The correct output for `x = 10` should be `5` because `gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 7` is the maximum possible value.

Thus, the program is incorrect for composite numbers.
