You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` from user input, where `3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, and creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`. It then reverses the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) and prints the modified list. The final state of the program is that the list `a` is printed, where the elements at even indices are swapped with the elements at the next odd indices, and the last element remains unchanged if `n` is odd.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate a permutation `p` of length `n` such that for any two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j), the conditions `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` do not hold simultaneously.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it generates a list `a` containing the integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based) of the list `a`.
   - Finally, it prints the modified list `a`.

3. **Checking the Permutation:**
   - The list `a` is initially a permutation of length `n` containing the integers from 1 to `n`.
   - Reversing the elements at even indices means that the elements at positions 0, 2, 4, etc., are reversed in their order.

4. **Ensuring the Conditions:**
   - The key condition is that there should not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - By reversing the elements at even indices, the program ensures that the elements at even positions are not in their natural order, which helps in breaking the divisibility pattern.
   - For example, if `n = 4`, the initial list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. After reversing the even indices, the list becomes `[3, 2, 1, 4]`. This permutation does not satisfy the condition `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` for any valid `i` and `j`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly: `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3` and `3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`.
   - For `n = 3`, the initial list is `[1, 2, 3]`. After reversing the even indices, the list becomes `[3, 2, 1]`, which is a valid permutation.
   - For larger values of `n`, the same logic applies, ensuring that the permutation is valid.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program generates a valid permutation for each test case.
   - The logic of reversing the even indices effectively breaks the divisibility pattern required by the problem.
