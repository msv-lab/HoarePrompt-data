Output State: **`price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `pq`, `price`, `day`, `total_cost`, and `tickets_bought` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet only modifies the `price_increase` variable by adding the value of `tickets_to_buy` to it. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `pq`, `price`, `day`, `total_cost`, and `tickets_bought`) remain in their initial state as described in the initial conditions.
