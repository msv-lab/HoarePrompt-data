The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is set to -1 before the loop, but the loop will overwrite this value with 0 on the first iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1**
