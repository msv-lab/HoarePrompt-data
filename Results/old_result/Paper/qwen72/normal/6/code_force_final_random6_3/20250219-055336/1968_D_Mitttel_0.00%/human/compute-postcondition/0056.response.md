The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `remainder_steps`. The loop will execute based on the value of `remainder_steps`. For the loop to execute, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`cycle_length` must be greater than 0, `cycle_score` is incremented by the value of `a[cycle_pos - 1]` for each iteration, `cycle_pos` is updated to `p[cycle_pos - 1]` after each iteration, the loop executes `cycle_length` times, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length` and must be greater than 0, `score` is increased by `full_cycles * cycle_score`**
