Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1` and `r` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`, `st` is 1, `end` is 0, `ans` is the difference `r - l`**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so `l` is now 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
