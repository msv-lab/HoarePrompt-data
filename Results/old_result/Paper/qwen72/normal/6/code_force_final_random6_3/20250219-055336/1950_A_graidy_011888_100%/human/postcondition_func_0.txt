The function `func` reads an integer `n` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. It then checks the relationship between these integers and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b` and `b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all `n` test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that `n` test cases have been processed, and the appropriate output ('STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE') has been printed for each test case.
