The code snippet `word = ''` reassigns the variable `word` to an empty string. The previous value of `word` was determined based on the value of `n`, but now `word` is explicitly set to an empty string. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 3 to 78, `i` is 2, `word` is an empty string.**
