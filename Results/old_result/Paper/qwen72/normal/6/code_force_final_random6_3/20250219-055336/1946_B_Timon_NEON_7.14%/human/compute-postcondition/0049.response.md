Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[2], 2]`, and `segments_variants` remains as it was in the initial state.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `new_segment = [arr[i], i]` assigns the value `[arr[2], 2]` to `new_segment` because `i` is 2.
- The values of `arr`, `i`, and `max_sum` remain unchanged.
- The state of `segments_variants` remains as it was in the initial state, which could be either `[[first element of arr, 0, -1]]` if `arr[0]` is less than 0, or an empty list if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0.
