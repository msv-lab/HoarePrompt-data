Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the value `xor`, `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `xor = 0` resets the value of `xor` to 0. Since `xor` was previously the result of `xor` XOR `i`, this operation effectively changes `xor` to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
