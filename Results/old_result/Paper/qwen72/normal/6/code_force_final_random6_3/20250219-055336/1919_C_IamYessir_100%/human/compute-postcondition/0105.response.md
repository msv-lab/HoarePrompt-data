Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is `n-1`, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than the element immediately before it in the list. The values of `_`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, and `cp` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, this means:
- The list `a` must have at least `n` elements, where `n` is the input integer.
- The loop variable `i` will have reached `n-1` after all iterations.
- The variable `s` will count the number of times an element in `a` is greater than the element immediately before it.
- The variables `_`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, and `cp` will retain their initial values as they are not modified within the loop.
