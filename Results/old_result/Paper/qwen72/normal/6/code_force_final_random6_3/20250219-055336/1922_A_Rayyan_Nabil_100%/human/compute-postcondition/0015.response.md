Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `a` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `results` is a list that includes the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` twice.**

The value of `n` is updated to an integer obtained from user input, with any leading and trailing whitespace removed. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `results`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
