Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if Bob can cut a rectangle of size \( a \times b \) into two smaller rectangles and then reassemble them into a different rectangle. The key insight is that for Bob to form a different rectangle, at least one of the dimensions \( a \) or \( b \) must be even. This is because if both dimensions are odd, cutting the rectangle will only produce smaller rectangles with odd dimensions, and reassembling them will not yield a different rectangle (since all possible combinations will result in the same dimensions or their rotations).

The provided program checks if \( b \) is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' if it is not. However, it does not consider the case where \( a \) is even and \( b \) is odd, which should also return 'yes'. Therefore, the program is incomplete and does not correctly handle all possible inputs.

To correct this, the program should check if either \( a \) or \( b \) is even, and return 'yes' if at least one of them is even. The current implementation only checks \( b \), which is insufficient.

Correctness: **False**
