The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `vals`. The loop iterates over the elements of `vals`, and at the start of each iteration, `x` is set to the next element in the list.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the first integer in the list `vals`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be set to the second integer in the list `vals`, and `vals` must still have at least one more element after the first one.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `N` is an input integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 50)
- `vals` is a list of N integers where each integer `k_i` satisfies (2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20)
- `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)`
- `x` is the first integer in the list `vals`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `x` must be the second integer in the list `vals`
- `vals` must have at least 2 elements

State: **`N` is an input integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 50), `vals` is a list of N integers where each integer `k_i` satisfies (2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20), `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)`, `x` is the second integer in the list `vals`, and `vals` must have at least 2 elements**
