Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where each \(p_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\), \(p_i \neq i\), and all \(p_i\) are distinct.
   - `v` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements initialized to the input values.
   - `i` is set to `n`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   if v[v[i]] == i:
       print(2)
       return
   else:
       print(3)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is set to `n`.
   - The condition `if v[v[i]] == i` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, the program prints `2` and returns.
   - If the condition is false, the program prints `3`.

4. **Understanding the Condition:**
   - `v[i]` is the element at index `i` in the list `v`.
   - `v[v[i]]` is the element at the index `v[i]` in the list `v`.
   - The condition `v[v[i]] == i` checks if the element at the index `v[i]` in `v` is equal to `i`.

5. **Initial Values:**
   - Since `i` is `n`, we need to check `v[v[n]] == n`.
   - The list `v` is of length `n + 1`, so `v[n]` is a valid index.
   - The list `p` contains `n` distinct integers, each different from its index, and each \(p_i\) is between 1 and `n`.

6. **Possible Values:**
   - Given that `p` contains distinct integers and \(p_i \neq i\), the elements in `v` are initialized to some values that are not necessarily the same as their indices.
   - Therefore, `v[n]` is some integer \(k\) where \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
   - `v[v[n]]` is then `v[k]`, which is another integer \(m\) where \(1 \leq m \leq n\).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `p_i` is distinct and \(p_i \neq i\), it is highly unlikely that `v[v[n]]` will be equal to `n`.
   - Therefore, the condition `v[v[i]] == i` is most likely false.

8. **Output:**
   - The code will execute the `else` block and print `3`.

Output: **3**
