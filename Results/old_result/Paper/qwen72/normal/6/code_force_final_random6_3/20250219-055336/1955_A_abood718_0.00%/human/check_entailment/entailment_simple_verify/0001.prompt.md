You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():

            print(X)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
- Maxim needs to buy exactly \( n \) yogurts.
- The price of one yogurt is \( a \) burles.
- The promotion price for two yogurts is \( b \) burles.
- The goal is to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy \( n \) yogurts.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
```

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns them to variables \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) respectively.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - **If \( B \times 2 < C \):**
     - This condition checks if the regular price for two yogurts is cheaper than the promotion price.
     - If true, the program prints \( A \times B \), which is the total cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
   - **If \( A \% 2 == 0 \):**
     - This condition checks if the number of yogurts \( A \) is even.
     - If true, the program prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the total cost if all yogurts are bought in pairs at the promotion price.
   - **Otherwise:**
     - If the number of yogurts \( A \) is odd, the program calculates \( X = A // 2 \), which is the number of pairs of yogurts.
     - It then prints \( X \) (which is not the correct output) and \( X \times C + B \), which is the total cost for buying \( X \) pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Output for Odd Number of Yogurts:**
  - The program prints \( X \) (the number of pairs) before printing the actual cost, which is incorrect.
  - The correct output should only be the total cost, not the number of pairs.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Explanation:
- **If \( B \times 2 < C \):**
  - The regular price for two yogurts is cheaper, so the total cost is \( A \times B \).
- **If \( A \% 2 == 0 \):**
  - The number of yogurts is even, so the total cost is \( \frac{A \times C}{2} \).
- **Otherwise:**
  - The number of yogurts is odd, so the total cost is \( X \times C + B \), where \( X = \frac{A}{2} \) (integer division).

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it prints an extra value \( X \) when the number of yogurts is odd. The corrected program should only print the total cost.

Correctness: **False**
