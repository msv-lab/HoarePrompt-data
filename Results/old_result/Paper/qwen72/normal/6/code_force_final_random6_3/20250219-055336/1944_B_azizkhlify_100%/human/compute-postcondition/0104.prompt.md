Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `res` must contain all the elements that were processed and had `l[a[i] - 1]` equal to 1, `i` is the last element of `res`, and `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        r[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`res` must contain all the elements that were processed and had `l[a[i] - 1]` equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `i` is the last element of `res`. If `ul` is equal to `ur` and `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`res` must contain all the elements that were processed and had `l[a[i] - 1]` equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `i` is the last element of `res` + 1, and `i` must be less than `2 * n`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0 and `ur` is increased by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`res` must contain all the elements that were processed and had `l[a[i] - 1]` equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `i` is the last element of `res` + 2, and `i` must be less than `2 * n`. If `ul == ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0 and `ur` is incremented by 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
