Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 3`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `v` is not 0 and is in `remaining_vertices`, `remaining_vertices` no longer includes the current value of `v`, and `path` is a list that now includes the current value of `v`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `path` now includes the current value of `v`.**

In natural language: The value of `n` remains an integer between 2 and 100,000. The value of `d` remains `n - 3`. The values of `v` and `u` are still the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `v` is not 0 and is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`, and `v` is added to the list `path`. The program then breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The list `path` now includes the current value of `v`.
