### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - Inside the loop, the function `func_1` is called, which is responsible for handling each test case.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is incorrectly defined as it does not take any parameters. According to the problem description, it should take a string `s` as input and return an integer representing the minimum possible penalty.
   - The function should be defined as `def func_1(s: str) -> int:` to match the problem requirements.

3. **String and Integer Input:**
   - The function correctly reads the integer `n` and the string `s` from the standard input.
   - The string `s` is expected to be of length `n` and consist only of characters "+" and "-".

4. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the number of "-" characters in `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.
   - The penalty is then calculated using the formula `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.
   - This formula is based on the idea that the optimal way to split the array is to group consecutive "+" and "-" characters together to minimize the penalty. If the number of "+" and "-" characters is not equal, the penalty can be reduced by grouping them in a way that the sum of the subarrays is zero or as close to zero as possible.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, it means the string `s` consists entirely of "-" characters. In this case, the penalty is `n` because each subarray will have a sum of `-1` and the penalty will be `1 * n`.
   - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the penalty is calculated as `n - 2 * neg`, which is the correct approach to minimize the penalty by balancing the "+" and "-" characters.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the calculated penalty for each test case, which is the expected behavior.

### Correctness:
The program is **incorrect** because the function `func_1` is not defined with the required parameter `s`. This will cause a runtime error when the function is called in the loop. Additionally, the function should return the penalty instead of printing it, as per the problem description.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t -= 1

def func_1(s: str) -> int:
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
    return n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n
```

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
