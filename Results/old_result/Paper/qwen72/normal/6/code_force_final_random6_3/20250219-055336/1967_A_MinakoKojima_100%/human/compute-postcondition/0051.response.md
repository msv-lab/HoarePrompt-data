The code snippet `res -= 1` decrements the value of `res` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`, `ans` is `ans + dif`, `res` is `n - 4` if `dif` is 0, otherwise `res` is `n - 5`, `k` is `k - dif * 3`.**
