Reasoning:  
The program provided is not entirely correct based on the problem description. The key issue is that the function `func_1` only checks if `b` is an even number, but it does not consider the possibility of cutting the rectangle along the `a` dimension as well. According to the problem, Bob can cut the rectangle parallel to either side, and then try to form a new rectangle from the resulting pieces.

To correctly solve the problem, Bob can form a new rectangle if either `a` or `b` is even. This is because:
- If `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size `a/2` by `b`, and then arrange these to form a new rectangle of size `a` by `b/2`.
- If `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size `a` by `b/2`, and then arrange these to form a new rectangle of size `a/2` by `b`.

However, if both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because cutting along either dimension will result in two smaller rectangles with odd dimensions, and these cannot be rearranged to form a rectangle with different dimensions.

Therefore, the function should return "Yes" if either `a` or `b` is even, and "No" if both are odd.

The provided function only checks if `b` is even, which is insufficient. It should check both `a` and `b`.

Correctness: **False**
