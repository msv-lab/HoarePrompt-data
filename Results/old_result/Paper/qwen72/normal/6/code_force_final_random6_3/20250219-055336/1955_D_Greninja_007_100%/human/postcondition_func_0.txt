The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It returns the number of contiguous sublists of length `m` in the list `a` that have at least `k` elements in common with the list `b`. The function maintains the state of the input parameters and the Counter objects `ca` and `cb` throughout its execution. After the function concludes, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, `a` and `b` are not modified, and the return value `ans` represents the count of such sublists.
