Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `_` is 0, `s` is 1 + 1 // (k - 1) + (1 + 1 // (k - 1)) // (k - 1) + 1, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `s` is 1 + 1 // (k - 1).
- The code `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` updates `s` by adding the integer division of `s` by (k - 1) and 1 to the current value of `s`.
- Therefore, the new value of `s` is 1 + 1 // (k - 1) + (1 + 1 // (k - 1)) // (k - 1) + 1.
- The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged.
