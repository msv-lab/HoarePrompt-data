Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to [arr[1], 1] and `segments_variants` is updated based on the conditions described. Otherwise, `new_segment` and `segments_variants` remain unchanged.***
