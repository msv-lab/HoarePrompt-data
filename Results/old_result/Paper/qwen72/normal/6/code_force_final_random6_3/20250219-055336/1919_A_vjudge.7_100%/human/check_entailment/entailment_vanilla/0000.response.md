### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After deciding whether to swap, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., cannot remove a coin because their wallet is empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - If both players play optimally, they will always try to avoid losing.
   - The key to determining the winner is to consider the total number of coins in both wallets.
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always win.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win.

3. **Explanation of the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It then checks if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1`).
   - If the sum is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

4. **Bitwise AND Operation:**
   - The expression `a + b & 1` is used to check if the sum of `a` and `b` is odd or even.
   - `a + b & 1` is equivalent to `(a + b) % 2` because the bitwise AND with 1 will be 1 if the sum is odd and 0 if the sum is even.

5. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic is correct because:
     - If the total number of coins is even, the game will end in a situation where both wallets are empty at the same time, and Bob will be the last to make a move.
     - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will be the last to make a move, and Bob will be the one who cannot make a move.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly:
     - When `a` and `b` are both 1, the total is 2 (even), and Bob wins.
     - When `a` is 1 and `b` is 4, the total is 5 (odd), and Alice wins.
     - When `a` and `b` are both large numbers, the program still correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the provided problem description and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
