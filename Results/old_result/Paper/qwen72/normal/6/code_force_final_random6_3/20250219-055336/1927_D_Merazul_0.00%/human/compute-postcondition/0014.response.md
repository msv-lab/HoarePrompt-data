Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a set of `n` unique integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is the last integer in the input split by spaces and must be greater than 0, `b` is a set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `f` is 1 if `1` is in `a` or `b`, otherwise `f` is 0, `m` is equal to `k // 2 - (1 if `1` is in `a` and not in `b`, otherwise `m` remains `k // 2`), `n` is equal to `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `u` is `True` if `1` is in `a`, otherwise `u` is `False`, `v` is `True` if `1` is in `b`, otherwise `v` is `False`.**
