The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `a` and `b` where 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output for each case is not provided in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b` between 1 and 10^9. The function returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
