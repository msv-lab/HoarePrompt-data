Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than 0, `x` is \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\). If the condition \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0\) is true, then `suma` is `a + 1`. Otherwise, `suma` remains `0`.***
