Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `c` is 0, and `maxi` is 0.**

The code snippet `maxi = 0` resets the value of `maxi` to 0, overriding the previous value which was the maximum of the previous `maxi` and the sum of the non-negative elements of `l` from the last negative element (or from the start if no negative element is encountered) to the end of the list. All other variables remain unchanged.
