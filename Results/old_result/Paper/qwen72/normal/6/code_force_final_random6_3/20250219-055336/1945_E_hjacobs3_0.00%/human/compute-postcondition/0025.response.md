The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `array` and `find`. `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` (where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n. The function returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the value of `l + 1` converted to a string, and the second string is the index of `find` in `array` plus 1, also converted to a string.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `array` of integers representing a permutation of size `n` and an integer `find` within the range 1 to `n`. It returns a list of two strings: the first string is the value of `l + 1` (where `l` is not defined in the input), and the second string is the index of `find` in `array` plus 1.**
