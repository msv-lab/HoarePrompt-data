The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, and `func_1()` has been called again. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than `_`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `func_1()` has been called again.**
