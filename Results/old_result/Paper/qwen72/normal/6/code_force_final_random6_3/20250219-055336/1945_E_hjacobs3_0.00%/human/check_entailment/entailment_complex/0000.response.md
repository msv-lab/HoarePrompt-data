Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the permutation and the target value `x`. It also correctly prints the number of operations and the indices for swapping if needed.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in the function `func_1` is implemented to find the smallest index `l` such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`. This is a standard binary search approach, but it is applied to an unsorted permutation, which is the core of the problem.

3. **Swapping Logic**: After the binary search, the function checks if `l` is the index of `find` in the array. If not, it prints `1` and returns the indices to swap the element at position `l` with the element at the position of `find`. This ensures that the binary search will find `find` at the correct position after the swap.

4. **Handling Correct Position**: If `l` is already the index of `find`, the function prints `0`, indicating no swaps are needed, and does not return anything.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when the target value `x` is at the beginning or end of the array, or when the array is already in a sorted order.

6. **Constraints**: The program respects the constraints given in the problem description, ensuring that no more than 2 swaps are performed and that the total number of test cases and the sum of `n` values do not exceed the specified limits.

However, there is a minor issue in the binary search logic:
- The initial values for `l` and `r` should be `0` and `n` respectively, not `0` and `n - 1`. This is because the binary search loop condition is `l <= r`, and `r` should be set to `n` to correctly handle the case where `x` is greater than all elements in the array.

Given this, the program is almost correct but has a small bug in the binary search initialization. Fixing this would make the program fully correct.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, the initial values for `l` and `r` should be:
```python
l, r = 0, n
```

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n
    while l < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid
        else:
            l = mid + 1
    
    #State: `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` >= `find`, and `r` is `l`.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
    else :
        print(0)
```

With this fix, the program should work correctly for all test cases.
