The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `ansv`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the length of `ansv`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(subseq_lens)`, and `ansv` must have at least `len(subseq_lens) + 1` elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `ansv` must have at least `len(subseq_lens) + 2` elements.

State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the lengths of sub-sequences and must have at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements, `mx` is the maximum length of these sub-sequences, `ansv` must have at least `len(subseq_lens) + 2` elements, `i` is `len(subseq_lens) + 1`**
