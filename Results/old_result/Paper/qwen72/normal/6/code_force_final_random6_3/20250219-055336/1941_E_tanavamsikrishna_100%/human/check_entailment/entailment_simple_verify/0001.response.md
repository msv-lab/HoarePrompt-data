### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports installed in the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(row, d: int)`**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - It starts by setting the cost of the first cell to 1 (since a support must be installed there).
   - It then iterates through the first `d` cells, adding 2 to the cost of each cell (1 for the support and 1 for the installation cost).
   - A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum costs of the cells within the sliding window of size `d`.
   - For each cell beyond the first `d` cells, it ensures that the distance between the current cell and the nearest support is no more than `d` by popping elements from the heap that are too far away.
   - It then adds the cost of the current cell to the minimum cost from the heap, and pushes the updated cost back into the heap.
   - Finally, it returns the cost of the last cell, which represents the minimum cost for the entire row.

3. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It reads the river grid (a list of `n` rows, each with `m` cells).
   - It calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The function handles the constraints correctly, ensuring that the sum of `n * m` does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.
   - The function correctly installs supports in the first and last columns.
   - The function ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports does not exceed `d`.

5. **Algorithm Correctness:**
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the minimum cost for each cell is efficiently calculated.
   - The sliding window approach with the heap is appropriate for maintaining the minimum cost within the required distance `d`.
   - The function correctly sums the costs for `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.

6. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The input is read correctly, and the output is printed as required.
   - The function handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

### Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **Function 1: `func_1(row, d)`**
  - **Initial State:**
    - `row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` and `row[-1]` are initially 0.
    - `d` is a positive integer such that `1 <= d < len(row)`.
  - **After Setting `row[0] = 1`:**
    - The cost of the first cell is set to 1, which is correct because a support must be installed there.
  - **Loop for the First `d` Cells:**
    - For each cell from `1` to `d-1`, the cost is increased by 2. This is correct because each cell needs a support, and the installation cost is 1.
  - **Heap Initialization:**
    - A min-heap is created with the first `d` cells and their indices. This is correct for maintaining the minimum costs within the sliding window.
  - **Loop for Remaining Cells:**
    - The loop iterates from `d` to the end of the row.
    - It pops elements from the heap that are too far away (distance > `d`).
    - It updates the cost of the current cell by adding the minimum cost from the heap and the installation cost.
    - It pushes the updated cost and the current index back into the heap.
  - **Final State:**
    - The loop has completed all its iterations.
    - `row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0.
    - The function returns the cost of the last cell, which is the minimum cost for the entire row.

- **Function 2: `func_2()`**
  - **Initial State:**
    - The function reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
    - It reads the river grid, which is a list of `n` rows, each with `m` cells.
  - **Cost Calculation:**
    - It calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
  - **Total Cost Calculation:**
    - It calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
    - It prints the minimum total cost.
  - **Final State:**
    - `n` must be at least `k`.
    - `i` is `n - k + 1`.
    - `costs` is a list of length `n`.
    - `total_costs` is a list with `n - k + 1` elements, where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements in `costs`.
    - The function prints the minimum value from `total_costs`.
