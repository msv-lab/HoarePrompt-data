Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, and it is guaranteed that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `dp` is a list with three elements: [1, 3, (3 + 2 * (3 - 1) * 1) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]; `i` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The list `dp` is updated by appending a new element, which is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`.
  - `dp[-1]` is 3.
  - `dp[-2]` is 1.
  - `i` is 3.
  - The new element is `(3 + 2 * (3 - 1) * 1) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`, which simplifies to `(3 + 2 * 2 * 1) % 1000000007`, and further simplifies to `(3 + 4) % 1000000007`, resulting in `7 % 1000000007`, which is 7.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged.
