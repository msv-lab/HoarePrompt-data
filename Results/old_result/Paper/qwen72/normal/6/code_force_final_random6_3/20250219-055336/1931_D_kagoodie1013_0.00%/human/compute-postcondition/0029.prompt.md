Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the first tuple, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in arr:
    mod_x = -num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
    mod_x_key = num % x
    mod_y_key = num % y
    mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
    mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the first tuple and must have at least one element, `results` is an empty list, `count` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` as a key and 1 as its value, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` as a key and 1 as its value, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_x` is `-num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the first tuple and must have at least 2 elements, `results` is an empty list, `count` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` as a key and 2 as its value, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` as a key and 2 as its value, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `mod_x` is `-num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the first tuple and must have at least 3 elements, `results` is an empty list, `count` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` as a key and 3 as its value, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` as a key and 3 as its value, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `mod_x` is `-num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
