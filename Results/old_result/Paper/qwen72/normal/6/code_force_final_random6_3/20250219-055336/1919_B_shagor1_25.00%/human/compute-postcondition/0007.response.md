The only objects in the loop head are the string `s` and the variable `i`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `s` needs to be assigned to `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) consisting only of characters "+" and "-".
- `i` is the first character of `s`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `neg` is 0 unless `i` is "-", in which case `neg` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` should now be the second character of `s`.
- The state of `s` remains the same, as it is the iterable being looped over.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) consisting only of characters "+" and "-", `i` is the second character of `s`, `n` is an input integer, and `neg` is 0 unless `i` is "-", in which case `neg` is 1.**
