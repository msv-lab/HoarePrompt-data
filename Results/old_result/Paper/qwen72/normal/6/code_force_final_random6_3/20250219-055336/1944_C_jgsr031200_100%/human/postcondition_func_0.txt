The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers, where each integer is less than the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. It calculates the frequency of each integer in `arr` and then prints the first integer that appears exactly once in `arr` if there are at least two unique integers, or the first integer that does not appear in `arr` if encountered. If no such integer is found, the function does not return any value.
