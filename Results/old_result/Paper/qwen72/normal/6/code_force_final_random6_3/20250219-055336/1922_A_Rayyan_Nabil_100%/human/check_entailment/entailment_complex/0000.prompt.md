Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

# Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `n-1`, and either `a[i]` is equal to `c[i]` or `b[i]` is equal to `c[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. If at any point both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are not equal to `c[i]`, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the program does not return 'YES'.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns 'YES' if at any index `i` (0 ≤ i < n), both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. Otherwise, it returns 'NO' if for every index `i` (0 ≤ i < n), at least one of `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches `c[i]`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and a, b, c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `a` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `results` is a list that includes the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` `t` times.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `a` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `results` is a list that includes the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` `t` times, `results` must have `t` elements, and all elements in `results` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` and consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It then calls `func_1` with these parameters and appends the result to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element in `results`. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the results of calling `func_1` for each test case have been printed.
