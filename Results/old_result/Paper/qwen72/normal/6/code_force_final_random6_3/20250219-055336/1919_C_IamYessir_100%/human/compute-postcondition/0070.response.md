To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1
- `lit` is a list of integers
- `cp` is 0
- `i` is 1

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
- `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue executing. Since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2.

The other variables (`_`, `lit`, `cp`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2**
