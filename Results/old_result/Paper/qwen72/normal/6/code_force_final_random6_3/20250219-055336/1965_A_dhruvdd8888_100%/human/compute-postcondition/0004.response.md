Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The length of `test_cases` is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `N` is an input integer. `nums` is a sorted list of integers, and now includes the integer 0. `ls` is 0.**
