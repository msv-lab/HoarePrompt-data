The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `results`. If `results` has more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list that includes the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` `t` times, and `result` is the first element in the `results` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least 2 elements, and `result` will be the second element in the `results` list.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `a` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `results` is a list that includes the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` `t` times, `results` must have at least 2 elements, `result` is the second element in the `results` list**
