The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('Bob')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing a string literal `'Bob'`.
- The initial state provides information about variables `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The relationship between `a` and `b` is described in detail, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will simply print the string `'Bob'` regardless of the initial state of the variables.

Output: **Bob**
