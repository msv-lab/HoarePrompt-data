The last element of the list `a` is removed, and since it was 0, the new last element of `a` is now the second-to-last element before the execution. The variables `res` and `t` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-empty list with the last element being the second-to-last element before the execution, `res` is 0, `t` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with the last element being the second-to-last element before the execution, `res` is 0, `t` is greater than 0.**
