The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `ans_f`. For the loop to execute, `ans_f` must contain at least one element. The variable `i` will take the value of the first element in `ans_f` at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is 0
- `i` is `t - 1` (which is -1)
- `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements from each test case
- `n` is the last input integer that must be greater than 0
- `l` is the last input string
- `lst` is the last list of substrings obtained by splitting the last `l` using spaces as the delimiter
- If the length of `lst` was initially greater than or equal to 2, `lst` will have all but the last two elements removed, and `ans` will be the sum of the minimum values of the pairs of elements removed
- If the length of `lst` was exactly 2, `ans` will be the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers, and the loop will have exited after the first iteration

To ensure the loop executes, `ans_f` must have at least one element. The value of `i` will be the first element of `ans_f` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is 0, `i` is the first element of `ans_f`, `ans_f` must contain at least one element, `n` is the last input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the last input string, `lst` is the last list of substrings obtained by splitting the last `l` using spaces as the delimiter, and `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of the pairs of elements removed if the length of `lst` was initially greater than or equal to 2, or the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers if the length of `lst` was exactly 2**
