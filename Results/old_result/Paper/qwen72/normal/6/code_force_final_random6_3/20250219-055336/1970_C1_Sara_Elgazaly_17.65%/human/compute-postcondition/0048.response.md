Output State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `_` is `x - 2`, `a` and `b` are input integers, `lst[a]` is a list that now includes `b` `x - 1` times, `lst[b]` is a list that now includes `a` `x - 1` times, `s` is False, `lst[x]` is now non-empty but has one less element, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation, and `lst[y]` is not an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` remains an integer between 2 and 2×10^5.
- The value of `_` remains `x - 2`.
- The values of `a` and `b` remain as input integers.
- The list `lst[a]` still includes `b` `x - 1` times.
- The list `lst[b]` still includes `a` `x - 1` times.
- The value of `s` remains False.
- The list `lst[x]` is now non-empty but has one less element after the pop operation.
- The variable `y` is assigned the last element of `lst[x]` before the pop operation.
- The condition that `lst[y]` is not an empty list is still valid, so we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
