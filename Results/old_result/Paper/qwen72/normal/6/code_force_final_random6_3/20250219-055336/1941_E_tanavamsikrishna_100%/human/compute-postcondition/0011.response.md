Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be at least `k`.
   - `i` is defined as `n - k + 1`.
   - `costs` is a list of length `n`.
   - `total_costs` is a list with `n - k + 1` elements, where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements in `costs`, starting from index `0` to `n - k`.

2. **Understanding `total_costs`:**
   - The list `total_costs` is constructed by summing up `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
   - For example, if `costs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k = 3`, then:
     - `total_costs[0]` would be `costs[0] + costs[1] + costs[2] = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6`
     - `total_costs[1]` would be `costs[1] + costs[2] + costs[3] = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9`
     - `total_costs[2]` would be `costs[2] + costs[3] + costs[4] = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12`
   - Therefore, `total_costs` would be `[6, 9, 12]`.

3. **Code Execution:**
   - The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will find the minimum value in the `total_costs` list and print it.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `total_costs` is a list of sums of `k` consecutive elements in `costs`, the minimum value in `total_costs` will be the smallest sum of any `k` consecutive elements in `costs`.

Given the initial state and the construction of `total_costs`, the output will be the minimum sum of any `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where min(total_costs) is the minimum sum of any k consecutive elements in the costs list)**
