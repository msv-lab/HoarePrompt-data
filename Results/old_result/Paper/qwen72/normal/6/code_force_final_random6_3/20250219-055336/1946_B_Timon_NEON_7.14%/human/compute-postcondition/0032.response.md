Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1]] if `arr[0]` is less than 0, or `segments_variants` remains an empty list if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0.**
