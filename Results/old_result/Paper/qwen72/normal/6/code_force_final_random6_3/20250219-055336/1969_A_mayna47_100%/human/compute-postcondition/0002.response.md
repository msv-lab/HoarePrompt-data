Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, each test case consists of `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list `p` of `n` integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct. `n` is an input integer. `v` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements initialized to the input values.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 5000, and each test case has an `n` and a list `p` with specific properties.
- The code snippet `v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` reads input values and updates the list `v`.
- After execution, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0, and the remaining elements are the integers provided by the input.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The properties of `t` and the test case list `p` are still valid and unchanged.
