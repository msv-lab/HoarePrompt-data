Output State: **`input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `index` is 5 + 2 * `n` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`), `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2 * n]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[5:5 + n]` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`), `a` is a list of integers from `data[5 + n:5 + 2 * n]` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`).**

Explanation:
- `n` is reassigned the integer value of `data[index]`, where `index` is calculated as `5 + 2 * n` (using the initial value of `n` from `data[1]`).
- The values of `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged, as they are derived from the initial `n` and the `data` list.
- The value of `index` is still valid and is now based on the new value of `n`.
- The other variables (`input`, `t`, `results`) remain unchanged.
