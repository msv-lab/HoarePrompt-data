The only objects in the loop head are variables `ii` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `ii` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than 1, and `ii` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

Since `ii` is incremented by 1 in the loop, at the start of the next iteration, `ii` will be 1. For the loop to continue, `n - 1` must be greater than `ii`, which means `n - 1` must be greater than 1, or equivalently, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than 2, `ii` is 1**
