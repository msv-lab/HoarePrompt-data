Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers where each integer `a_i` was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been increased by `i + 1` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`), and `a` is now sorted in descending order, `a` must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated and now unique list `a`, `cnt` is the difference between `n` and the length of `a` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[-1] - 1` and `a[-1] - 2`, `adv` is `cnt` and must be greater than 1, `j` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)` appends a new value to the list `ans`.
- `i` is 0, so `i - 1` is -1.
- `a[-1]` is the last element of the list `a`.
- `j` is 1, so `a[-1] - j - 1` is `a[-1] - 2`.
- The new value `a[-1] - 2` is appended to `ans`.
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is now 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
