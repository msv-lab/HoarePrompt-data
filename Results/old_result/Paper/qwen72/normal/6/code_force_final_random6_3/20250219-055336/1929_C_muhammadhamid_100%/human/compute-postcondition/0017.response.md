Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer input, `x` is an integer input that must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer input, `_` is 1, `s` is `1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1 + (1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is `x`, `int(input())` must be greater than `x`**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value.
- The initial value of `s` is `1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1`.
- After the update, `s` becomes `1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1 + (1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `_`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than `x` still holds.
