Output State: **`M` is 1000000007, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned new integer values from the input, `s` is `c * c * m * (k-1) * k // 2 + c * a * k`, `i` is `k`, `u` is the last integer value from the input, `v` is the last integer value from the input, `f` is the last integer value from the input, `a` is equal to the sum of all `f` values from the input, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `M` remains 1000000007.
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are still assigned from the input, as the code snippet does not change these values.
- The value of `s` is still `c * c * m * (k-1) * k // 2 + c * a * k`.
- The value of `i` is still `k`.
- The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are still the last integer values from the input.
- The value of `a` is still the sum of all `f` values from the input.
- The value of `c` is still the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.
