Output State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `_` is `x - 2`, `a` and `b` are input integers, `lst[a]` is a list that now includes `b` `x - 1` times, `lst[b]` is a list that now includes `a` `x - 1` times.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `x` remains an integer between 2 and 2×10^5.
- The loop counter `_` has reached `x - 2`, indicating that the loop has run `x - 1` times.
- The variables `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers input during the final iteration of the loop.
- The list `lst[a]` now contains the integer `b` a total of `x - 1` times.
- The list `lst[b]` now contains the integer `a` a total of `x - 1` times.
