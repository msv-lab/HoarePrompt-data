The code snippet `last.append(last[-1])` appends the last element of the list `last` to itself. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `last`, we can only say that the last element of `last` is duplicated. The values of `i` and `n` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `last` has its last element duplicated.**
