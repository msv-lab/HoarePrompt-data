The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'Alice'. The initial state describes several variables (`T`, `i`, `a`, `b`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables.

Output: **Alice**
