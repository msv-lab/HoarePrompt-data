### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to determine the minimum total cost to cyclically shift substrings of a binary string to make it sorted in non-descending order.
   - The cost of a shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of all shifts.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a binary string.
   - The output is the minimum total cost for each test case.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `s` and converts it to a list of integers.
   - It counts the number of zeroes in the string `s`.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.
   - It iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - If `c` is 0, it adds 1 to `ans` if there are any 1s before it (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`).
     - If `c` is 1, it adds the number of remaining zeroes to `ans` (i.e., `zeroes - cnt[0]`).
   - Finally, it prints the total cost `ans` for each test case.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string.
   - The key insight is that the cost of sorting a binary string is the sum of the lengths of the substrings that need to be shifted to move all 1s to the right of all 0s.
   - The program correctly counts the number of 0s and 1s and calculates the cost based on the positions of 1s and 0s in the string.
   - The logic of adding 1 to `ans` when encountering a 0 if there are any 1s before it, and adding the number of remaining zeroes when encountering a 1, ensures that the total cost is minimized.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") by outputting 0.
   - It also handles the case where the string is not sorted and needs multiple shifts to become sorted (e.g., "101011").
   - The program correctly handles the case where the string consists entirely of 1s or 0s.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of the program is O(n * m), where `n` is the number of test cases and `m` is the length of the string. This is efficient given the constraints.
   - The space complexity is O(m) for storing the string and the counters, which is also efficient.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using the given operations.

Final: **True**
