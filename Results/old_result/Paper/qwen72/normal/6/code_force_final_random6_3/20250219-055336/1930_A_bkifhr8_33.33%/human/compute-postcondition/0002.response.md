The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, and `ans_f` is an empty list. To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans_f` is an empty list**
