The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `vals`. For the loop to execute, `vals` must contain at least one integer. According to the given state, `N` is an input integer with a range of 1 to 50, and `vals` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `k_i` satisfies the condition 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20. Since `N` is at least 1, `vals` will always have at least one element, ensuring the loop can execute.

However, the state of `x` needs to be adjusted to reflect the first element of `vals` before the loop starts. Additionally, `den` is equal to the first integer in the list `vals`, which is consistent with the initial state.

State: **`N` is an input integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 50), `vals` is a list of N integers where each integer `k_i` satisfies (2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20), `den` is equal to the first integer in the list `vals`, `x` is the first integer in the list `vals`**
