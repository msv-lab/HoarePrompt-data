You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and `t` is now 0 (since all test cases have been processed). The variables `_`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`, and `cost` are no longer in their initial states and have been updated for each test case as the loop executed. The final value of `cost` for each test case has been printed, and the loop has ended.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of sale days `n`, the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day `m`, the total number of tickets to be bought `k`, and a list of ticket prices `a`. It calculates and prints the minimum total cost to buy `k` tickets over the `n` sale days, ensuring that no more than `m` tickets are bought on any single day. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed and their respective minimum costs have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line.
   - It reads the list of ticket prices `M` from the second line.

2. **Constraints Handling:**
   - The program sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure that the number of tickets bought per day does not exceed the total number of tickets needed.

3. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `M` in ascending order. This is a good strategy because it allows us to buy tickets at the lowest possible prices first.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days to Buy Tickets:**
   - The program calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`. This is the number of days required to buy all `k` tickets, given that we can buy at most `m` tickets per day.

5. **Selecting the Cheapest Days:**
   - The program selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` to get the cheapest days to buy tickets.

6. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days is exactly `k` (i.e., `n * m == k`), the program calculates the cost as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
     - `m * sum(N)` is the cost of buying `m` tickets on each of the `q` cheapest days.
     - `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is the additional cost due to the price increase on subsequent days.
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days is not exactly `k`, the program adjusts the calculation:
     - It pops the last element `w` from `N` and calculates the cost of buying the remaining `mu` tickets on the last day.
     - It then calculates the cost for the remaining days using the same formula as above.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Cost Calculation for the Last Day:**
  - The program incorrectly calculates the cost for the last day. The additional cost due to the price increase should be applied only to the tickets bought on that day, not to all previous days.
  - The formula `cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu` is incorrect. The term `n * m * mu` should not be added.

### Corrected Cost Calculation:
- If `n * m == k`, the cost calculation is correct.
- If `n * m != k`, the correct cost calculation should be:
  - `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + mu * w`.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** due to the flawed cost calculation for the last day.

### Correctness: **False**
