Output State: **`n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.** 

The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the first and second integers from the list `l1`, respectively. The list `l1` remains a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, and the condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
