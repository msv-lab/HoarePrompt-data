Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user. `ans` remains either `a[0]` or `a[0] + dif + k // 2`. `ans_list` still contains `a[0]`. `n` is still greater than 1. `dif` is still `a[2] - a[1]`. `i` is still 1. If `i` is not 0, `k` remains the same as it was before the execution of the code snippet, and `res` is updated to `res + k % 2`. Otherwise, `k` and `res` remain unchanged.***
