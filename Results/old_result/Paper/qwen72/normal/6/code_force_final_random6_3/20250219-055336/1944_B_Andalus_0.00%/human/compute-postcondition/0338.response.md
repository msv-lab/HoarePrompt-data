Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements and must have at least 3 elements, `sz` is 4 or 6 depending on the condition `k - sz` being greater than or equal to 2, `elem` is the third element in `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sz` is incremented by 2. Initially, `sz` was 2 or 4. After the increment, `sz` is now 4 or 6.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `rdb`, `elem`) and conditions remain unchanged.
