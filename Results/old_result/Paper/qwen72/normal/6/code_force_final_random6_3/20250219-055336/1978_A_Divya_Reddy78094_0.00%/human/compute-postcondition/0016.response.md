Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, sorted in descending order.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The variable `t` must have been greater than 0 initially, and it remains unchanged.
- The loop variable `_` will be equal to `t-1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times.
- The variable `n` will hold the last input integer that was read during the last iteration of the loop.
- The variable `nums` will be a list of integers that were input by the user during the last iteration of the loop, and this list will be sorted in descending order.
