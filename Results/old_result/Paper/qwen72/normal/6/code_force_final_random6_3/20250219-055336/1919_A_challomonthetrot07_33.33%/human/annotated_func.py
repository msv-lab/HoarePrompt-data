#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers (a, b).
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: `T` is an input integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 1000, `i` is `T-1`, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` == `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` is that they are equal. If `a` != `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` is maintained: if `a` is 1, the current value of `a` is 1, and the current value of `b` is not 1. If `a` is not 1, the current value of `a` is not 1, and the relationship between `a` and `b` is preserved: if `a` is odd, `a` remains an odd integer; if `a` is even, `a` remains an even integer; if `a` is even and `b` is odd, then `b` is odd; otherwise, if `a` > `b`, `a` is greater than `b`; if `a` <= `b`, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `T` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `T` <= 1000. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, where 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9. The function then prints a string indicating the winner of each test case based on the following rules: if `a` == `b`, it prints "Bob"; if `a` == 1, it prints "Alice"; if `b` == 1, it prints "Bob"; if `a` is odd, it prints "Bob"; if `a` is even and `b` is odd, it prints "Alice"; if `a` > `b`, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice". The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console.
