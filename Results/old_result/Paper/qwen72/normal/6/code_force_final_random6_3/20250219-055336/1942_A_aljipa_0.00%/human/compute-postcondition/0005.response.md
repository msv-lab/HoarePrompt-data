The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, it does not retain any specific state between iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, and it must still be greater than 0.

State: **`n` and `k` are input integers, `t` must be greater than 1, `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k == n`, a range from 0 to `n-1` if `k == 1`, otherwise `res` is a list containing `-1`**
