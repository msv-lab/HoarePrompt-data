Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is 2, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than the element immediately before it in the list. If `b[i]` > `b[i - 1]`, `s` is incremented by 1. `b` is a list with at least 3 elements, and the values of `_`, `n`, `lit`, and `cp` remain unchanged.***
