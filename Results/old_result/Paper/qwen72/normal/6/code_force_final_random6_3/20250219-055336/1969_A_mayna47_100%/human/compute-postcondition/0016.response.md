Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements initialized to the input values, `i` is `n`. If `v[v[i]]` is equal to `i` for any `i` in the range 1 to `n`, the program prints 2 and returns. Otherwise, the program returns nothing.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged. The list `v` also remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop. The loop variable `i` will have reached the value `n`. If at any point during the loop, the condition `v[v[i]] == i` was true, the program would have printed 2 and returned, terminating the loop early. If this condition was never true for any `i` in the range from 1 to `n`, the loop completes without printing anything or returning, and the program simply returns nothing.
