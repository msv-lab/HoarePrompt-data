Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and equal to `t`, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that appears exactly once and is encountered before the loop breaks, otherwise `first` is False, `i` is the index of the first integer in `arr` that either does not appear in `mpp` or appears exactly once and `first` is True, or `n` if the loop completes without breaking.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop will iterate through the range from 0 to `n-1`.
- If an integer `i` is not in the `mpp` keys, the loop will print `i` and break.
- If `i` is in `mpp` and its frequency is 1, `first` will be set to True.
- If `i` is in `mpp`, its frequency is 1, and `first` is already True, the loop will print `i` and break.
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `i` will be `n` and `first` will be True if there was at least one integer in `arr` that appeared exactly once, otherwise `first` will remain False.
