You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers, r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), and ops is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers.
def func_3(r, l, lst, ops):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if (min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    #State: `lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers, and `ops` now includes an additional list `[r + 1, l + 1]`. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst
    #The program returns the list `lst` where the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` contains `n` elements, each equal to `n`. The values of `r`, `l`, and `ops` remain unchanged. The minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is no longer 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It modifies the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` such that each element in this sublist is set to the length of the sublist (`n`). The function returns the modified list `lst`, ensuring the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is no longer 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `lst` where the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` contains `n` elements, each equal to `n`. The values of `r`, `l`, and `ops` remain unchanged. The minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is no longer 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
