The function `func_2` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, representing the length of the strings. `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a result based on these inputs.**
