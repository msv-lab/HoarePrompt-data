Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input, `nabors` is 1, `aa` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tot` is the sum of all values in the dictionary `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, `C` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in `bb` that are not in `D`, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in the first `m` elements of `aa` that are not in `D`, `bb` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in `bb`.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
            C[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            D[in_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of integers with a length greater than `m`, `in_aa` is the first element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element in `aa[:n - m]`, `tot` is the sum of all values in `D`, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of integers with a length greater than `m + 1`, `in_aa` is the second element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the second element in `aa[:n - m]`, `tot` is the sum of all values in `D`, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of integers with a length greater than `m + 2`, `in_aa` is the third element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the third element in `aa[:n - m]`, `tot` is the sum of all values in `D`, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. The conditions for updating `C`, `D`, and `E` based on `in_aa` and `out_aa` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
