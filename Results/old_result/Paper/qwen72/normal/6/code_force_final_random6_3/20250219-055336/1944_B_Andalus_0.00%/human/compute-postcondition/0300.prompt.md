Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements, `sz` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ldb` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element of `ldb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `k - sz` is at least 2, `sz` is increased by 2 and the program continues executing the next statement after the if block. If `k - sz` is less than 2, the program continues executing the next statement after the if block without modifying `sz`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ldb` must have at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element of `ldb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and the program exits the most internal loop or if statement. If `k - sz` is at least 2, `sz` is increased by 2. If `k - sz` is less than 2, the program continues executing the next statement after the if block without modifying `sz`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ldb` must have at least three elements, and `elem` is the third element of `ldb`. If `k - sz >= 2`, `sz` is increased by 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` after this increase, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
