Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the size of the array, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n, representing the elements of the array. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    st, end = 0, 0
    while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
        l += 1
        st += 1
    while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
        r -= 1
        end += 1
    if a[0] == a[-1]:
        ans = r - l - 1
    elif st == 0 and end == 0 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        ans = len(a) - 1
    else:
        ans = r - l
    print(max(0, ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is a temporary variable, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least two elements and the last two elements are equal, `l` is less than `r` or `r` is equal to `l`, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to `a[r + 1]` or `l` if all elements from `l` to `r` are equal, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are equal, `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal. If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, `ans` is equal to `r - l - 1`. If `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, `ans` is equal to `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is the difference `r - l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer and `n >= 5`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is the largest index such that `a[l] == a[l + 1]` for all `l < r` and `l` is at least 3, `r` is the largest index such that `a[r] != a[r + 1]` and `r` must be greater than `l`, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`, and so on until `a[l - 1]` must be equal to `a[l]`. If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. If `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and `st` is 0, then `end` is 0 and `ans` is the length of `a` minus 1. Otherwise, `st` is `l`, `end` is the number of times the loop executed, and `ans` is `r - l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `l` is the index of the first element in the list `a` that is not equal to its preceding element, `r` is the index of the last element in the list `a` that is not equal to its preceding element, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are all equal, `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are all equal, `n` is greater than 1, and `ans` is determined as follows: If the first element of the list `a` is equal to the last element of the list `a`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. If `st` is not 0 or `end` is not 0, then `ans` is `r - l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
