Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads two lines of input: the first line contains three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` sets of `k` unique characters. If it does, the function prints 'YES' and returns `None`. If it does not, the function prints 'NO' and then, for each character in the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that was not part of the last incomplete set, it prints a string consisting of the characters that completed the previous sets, followed by the character, and padded with 'a' characters to reach a total length of `n`. **
