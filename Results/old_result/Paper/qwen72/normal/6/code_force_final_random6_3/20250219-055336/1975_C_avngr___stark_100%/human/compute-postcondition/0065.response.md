The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 2 to ensure that `i` (which is now 1) is less than `n - 2`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `max` is either the second element of `temp` if the second element of `temp` is greater than the initial value of `max`, or remains the same as the initial value of `max` otherwise, and `temp` is a sorted list containing the first three elements of `a`.**
