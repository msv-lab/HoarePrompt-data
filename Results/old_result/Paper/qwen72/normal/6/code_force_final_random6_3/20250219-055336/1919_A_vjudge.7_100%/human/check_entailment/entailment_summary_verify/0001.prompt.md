You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `test` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. After processing each test case, it prints 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd. The function completes after processing all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing one coin from their current wallet.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet before removing a coin.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin from a non-empty wallet) loses.

2. **Optimal Play:**
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best move available to them.
   - The key to determining the winner is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins \(a + b\).

3. **Parity Analysis:**
   - If the total number of coins \(a + b\) is even, the game will end in a situation where both wallets are empty at the same time.
   - If the total number of coins \(a + b\) is odd, one player will always have one more coin than the other, and the player with the extra coin will be able to make the last move.

4. **Game Dynamics:**
   - If \(a + b\) is even, the number of moves each player can make is the same. Since Alice starts, Bob will make the last move, and Alice will be unable to make a move after that, resulting in Bob's win.
   - If \(a + b\) is odd, the number of moves each player can make is different. Alice will always have the advantage of making the last move, resulting in Alice's win.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins \(a\) and \(b\) in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - It checks if the sum \(a + b\) is even by using the bitwise AND operator `&` with 1. If the result is 0, the sum is even, and Bob wins. Otherwise, the sum is odd, and Alice wins.
   - The program correctly implements the logic based on the parity of \(a + b\).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its implementation and logic. It correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

### Correctness:
**True**
