The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is a new input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is at least 2, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 49) and is now `t - 2` with `t` being at least 0, `n` is a new input integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), `i` is 3**
