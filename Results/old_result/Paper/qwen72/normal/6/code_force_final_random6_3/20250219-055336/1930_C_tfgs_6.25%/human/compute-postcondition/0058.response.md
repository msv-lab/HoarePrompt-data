Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers where each integer `a_i` was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been increased by `i + 1` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`), and `a` is now sorted in descending order, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated and now unique list `a`, but the count of each element in `a` is decreased by 1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements of `a` in their original order, and additional elements that fill the gaps between consecutive elements of `a` such that the total number of elements in `ans` is `n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- **`n`**: Remains an integer within the range 1 to 3 · 10^5 and must be greater than 0.
- **`a`**: Remains a list of unique integers, each originally in the range 1 to 10^9 and increased by `i + 1` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`), and is sorted in descending order.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 1`, which is the last index of the list `a`.
- **`counter`**: The Counter object will have the count of each element in `a` decreased by 1, as each element in `a` is appended to `ans` exactly once.
- **`cnt`**: This will be 0, as the loop ensures that the total number of elements added to `ans` is exactly `n`.
- **`ans`**: The list `ans` will contain all elements of `a` in their original order, plus additional elements that fill the gaps between consecutive elements of `a` to ensure the total length of `ans` is `n`. These additional elements are chosen to be the largest possible values that do not overlap with the elements of `a` and are within the constraints of the loop.
