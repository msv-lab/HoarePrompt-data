Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed when the `print(ans)` statement executes.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 2\).
- `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop.
- `n` is a new input integer that must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.
- `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop.
- `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the current `cnt`.
- `n` is not equal to 1.
- `ans` is not equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - `tmp` is set to the first element of the list `a` (i.e., `a[0]`).
   - `i` is set to `n-1`, which means it is the index of the last element in the list `a` (since `n` is the length of the list `a`).

2. **Loop to Count Consecutive Elements:**
   - The loop iterates through the list `a` starting from the first element up to the last element.
   - For each element, it checks if the element is equal to `tmp`.
   - If the element is equal to `tmp`, it increments `cnt`.
   - If the element is not equal to `tmp`, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of the current `ans` and `cnt`, and then resets `cnt` to 1 and updates `tmp` to the current element.

3. **Final Update of `ans`:**
   - After the loop, `ans` is updated one last time to be the minimum of the current `ans` and `cnt`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will output the final value of `ans`, which is the minimum count of consecutive elements in the list `a` that are equal to any value in the list.

### Explanation of the Output:
- `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements in the list `a` that are equal to any value in the list.
- Since `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`, `ans` must be a value between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive).

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum count of consecutive elements in the list `a` that are equal to any value in the list, and ans is not equal to n)**
