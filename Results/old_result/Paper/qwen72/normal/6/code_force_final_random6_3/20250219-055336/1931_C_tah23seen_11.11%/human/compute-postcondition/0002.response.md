The variables in the loop head are `i` and `j`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i <= j`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0 and `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.

Given the constraints on `arr` (1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5), the length of `arr` is at least 1. Therefore, `j` is at least 0 (since `j` is `len(arr) - 1`), which means `i` (0) is always less than or equal to `j` (at least 0) for the first iteration of the loop.

No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= arr[i] <= len(arr), `i` is 0, `j` is len(arr) - 1**
