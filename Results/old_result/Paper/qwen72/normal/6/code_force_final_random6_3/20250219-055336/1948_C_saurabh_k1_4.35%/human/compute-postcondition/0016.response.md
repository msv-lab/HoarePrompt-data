The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the input integer `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `n` and the current value of `_`.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `n` is an input integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input. If the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is not the string `"<"`.**
