Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `flag` is False.**

The code snippet `flag = False` sets the variable `flag` to `False`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `t`, and `arr`) remain unchanged. The initial condition that `flag` was True if `arr[1]` was equal to `arr[0]` is no longer valid, and the program will now continue with `flag` set to `False`. If the program was inside a loop or if statement, it will not break out of it due to this code snippet.
