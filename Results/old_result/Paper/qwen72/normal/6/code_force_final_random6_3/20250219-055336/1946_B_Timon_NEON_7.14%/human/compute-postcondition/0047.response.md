Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is [first element of `arr` + `arr[1]` + `arr[2]`, 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1]] or [[arr[0], 0, 0]], depending on the initial value of `arr[0]`, `new_segment[0]` is `first element of `arr` + `arr[1]` + `arr[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `new_segment[0] += arr[i]` adds the value of `arr[2]` (since `i` is 2) to `new_segment[0]`.
- Initially, `new_segment[0]` is the sum of the first two elements of `arr` (i.e., `arr[0] + arr[1]`).
- After adding `arr[2]` to `new_segment[0]`, the new value of `new_segment[0]` is `arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2]`.
- The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `max_sum`, `max_segment`, and `segments_variants`) remain unchanged.
