The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `x` must still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is a list containing `[1]` if `x` is divisible by `1`, otherwise `output1` remains an empty list. `output2` is a list containing `[x]` if `x` is divisible by `1`, otherwise `output2` remains an empty list. `i` is 2.**
