Output State: **`arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`, `k` is 0, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, and `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**

The code snippet `c = 0` does not change the value of `c` from its initial state, which was already 0. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
