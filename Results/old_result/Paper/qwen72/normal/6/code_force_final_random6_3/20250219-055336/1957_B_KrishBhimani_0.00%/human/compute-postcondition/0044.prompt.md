Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1` and must be greater than or equal to the number of bits in `k`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is the number of bits in the original `k`, `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits in the original `k` that were set to 1, `ans` is an empty list, `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    if c == n - 1:
        ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
        break
    c += 1
    ans.append(1 << i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1` and must be greater than or equal to the number of bits in `k`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is the number of bits in the original `k`, `arr` must have at least one element, `ans` is a list containing a single element which is `1 << i`, `c` is 1. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing a single element which is `k0`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` contains the single element `1 << i` and `c` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1` and must be greater than or equal to the number of bits in `k`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `arr` must have at least two elements, `c` is 2, `ans` now contains the element `1 << i` appended to its previous contents.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1` and must be greater than or equal to the number of bits in `k`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `arr` must have at least three elements, `c` is 3, `ans` now contains the element `1 << i` appended to its previous contents, and if `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` also contains `k0 - sum(ans)` appended to its previous contents, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
