To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

### Current State:
- `row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0.
- `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`.
- `i` is `d + 6`.
- `min_heap` contains elements from `row[:d]` with their indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed, and the tuples `(row[i-1], i-1)` and `(row[i], i)` have been added to the heap.
- `e` is the last value popped from `min_heap` and satisfies the loop condition.
- `row[i]` is now equal to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.

### Loop Condition:
```
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
```

### Analysis:
1. **`e`**: This is the tuple that was last popped from `min_heap`, and it must satisfy the condition `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.
2. **`min_heap`**: The heap contains tuples of the form `(row[j], j)` where `j` is an index in `row`.
3. **`i`**: The current value of `i` is `d + 6`.
4. **`d`**: The value of `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`.

### Condition Breakdown:
- The condition `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)` needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute again.
- Substituting the current value of `i`:
  - `i - (d + 2) = (d + 6) - (d + 2) = 4`.
- Therefore, the condition simplifies to `e[1] <= 4`.

### Adjustments:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `e`, which is the result of `heappop(min_heap)`.
- For the loop to execute again, the next `e` popped from `min_heap` must have an index `e[1]` that is less than or equal to 4.

### Current State of `min_heap`:
- The heap contains elements from `row[:d]` with their indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed.
- The tuples `(row[i-1], i-1)` and `(row[i], i)` have been added to the heap.
- Given `i = d + 6`, the indices added to the heap are `i-1 = d + 5` and `i = d + 6`.

### Conclusion:
- The heap must contain at least one element with an index `e[1]` that is less than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute again.
- Since `i = d + 6` and `d` is greater than 0, the indices `d + 5` and `d + 6` are both greater than 4.
- Therefore, the heap must still contain elements from `row[:d]` with indices less than or equal to 4.

### Final State:
- The heap must contain elements with indices less than or equal to 4.
- The current state of `row`, `d`, and `i` does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0; `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`; `i` is `d + 6`; `min_heap` contains elements from `row[:d]` with their indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed, and the tuples `(row[i-1], i-1)` and `(row[i], i)` have been added to the heap; `e` is the last value popped from `min_heap` and satisfies the loop condition; `row[i]` is now equal to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`**.
