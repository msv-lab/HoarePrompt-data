Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. `freq` is a list where each element at index `i` corresponds to the number of times the integer `i` appears in `arr`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `arr` list remains unchanged. The `freq` list, however, has been updated such that each element at index `i` in `freq` now contains the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the `arr` list.
