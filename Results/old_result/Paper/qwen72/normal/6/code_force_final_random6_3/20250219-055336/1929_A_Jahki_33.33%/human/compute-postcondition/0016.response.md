The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `num2`. `a` is a list of integers with a length between 2 and 100, and each integer in the list is between 1 and 10^9. `num2` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and its value is between 1 and 500.

The function returns:
- Case_1: True
- Case_2: False

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `num2`. It returns `True` in one case and `False` in another case.**
