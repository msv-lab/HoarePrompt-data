Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans_list` contains `a[0]`, `a[0]`, and `ans`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `dif` is the difference between `a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]`, `ans` is `ans_initial * n - (n - 1) + res`, `k` remains unchanged, `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans_list.append(ans)` appends the value of `ans` to the list `ans_list`.
- Initially, `ans_list` contains `a[0]` and `a[0]`.
- After appending `ans`, `ans_list` now contains `a[0]`, `a[0]`, and `ans`.
- The values of `a`, `n`, `i`, `dif`, `ans`, `k`, and `res` remain unchanged.
