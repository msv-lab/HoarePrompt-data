Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 2, `a` is updated to `l[2]`, `b` remains infinity, and `c` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is updated to `l[2]` (the third element of the list `l`).
- The value of `b` remains infinity.
- The value of `c` is 0.
- The values of `int(input())`, `_`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- The value of `x` remains 2.
