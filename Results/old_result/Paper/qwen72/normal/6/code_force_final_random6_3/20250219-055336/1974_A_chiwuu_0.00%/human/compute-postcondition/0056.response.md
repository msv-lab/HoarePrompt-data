The function `func` does not explicitly list parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases and for each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. The function is expected to process these inputs and produce an output for each test case. Since the output is not specified, we can infer that the function returns a result based on the values of `x` and `y` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99). It returns a result for each test case, but the specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
