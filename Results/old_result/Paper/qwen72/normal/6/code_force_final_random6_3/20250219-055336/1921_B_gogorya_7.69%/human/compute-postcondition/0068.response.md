Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the new input integer, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`, `hd` is `a1 - a2`.**

The value of `res` is now the absolute value of the difference between `a1` and `a2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
