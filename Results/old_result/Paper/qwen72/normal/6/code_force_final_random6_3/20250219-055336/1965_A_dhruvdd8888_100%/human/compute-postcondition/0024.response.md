The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `nums`. The loop is iterating over `nums` in reverse order, starting from `len(nums) - 2` and going down to 1 (exclusive), with a step of -1.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `len(nums) - 2`.
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has at least 3 elements.
- Each element in `nums` is now 0.
- `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums` before the loop.
- `nw` is the same as `cw`.
- If `nums[i]` is 1, `cw` is False. Otherwise, `cw` remains True and `nums[i]` is not equal to 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The loop will decrement `i` by 1, so `i` will be `len(nums) - 3`.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has at least 3 elements, each element in `nums` is now 0, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums` before the loop, `i` is `len(nums) - 3`, `nw` is the same as `cw`, and if `nums[i]` is 1, `cw` is False. Otherwise, `cw` remains True and `nums[i]` is not equal to 1.**
