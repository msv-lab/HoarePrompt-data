Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is more than half of `k`, `t` is `k % 2`.**

The value of `t` is now the remainder when `k` is divided by 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
