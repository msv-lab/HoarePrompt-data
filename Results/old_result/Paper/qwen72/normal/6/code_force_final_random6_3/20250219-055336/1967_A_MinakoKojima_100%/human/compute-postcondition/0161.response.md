Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is equal to `a[0]` or `a[0] + dif` depending on the condition, `ans_list` contains `a[0]` and `a[0]`, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `res` is equal to `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `i` is 0, and the difference between the first two elements of `a` (`dif`) is not 0. If `k` was greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is `a[0] + dif` and `res` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `a[0]` and `res` remains `n - 1`.**
