Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 3, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `v[x]` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a positive integer equal to `int(data[3])`.**

Explanation:
- `x` is reassigned to the integer value of `data[3]`, which is a positive integer.
- The values of `t`, `idx`, `data`, `results`, `v`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The previous value of `x` (which was `int(data[2])`) is no longer relevant after the reassignment.
