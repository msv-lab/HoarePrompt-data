Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, or 3, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
