Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum value between the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`, `a` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `b` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9), `n` is an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `m` is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `x` is `min(a[i], b[i]) + min(a[i], b[i])`, `i` is `n - 3`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pergunta` is updated to the minimum value between the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`.
- The values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- `x` is still `min(a[i], b[i]) + min(a[i], b[i])`, which simplifies to `2 * min(a[i], b[i])`.
- `i` is still `n - 3`.
