Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `i` is len(arr) - 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is a list containing the sum of the last segment of non-negative numbers and the starting index of this segment, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of non-negative numbers found during the loop and the starting index of this segment, `segments_variants` is a list of lists that must include at least one element: `new_segment` + [len(arr) - 1], `total_max_segment` is now equal to `segment`.** 

The value of `total_max_segment` has been updated to be equal to the value of `segment`. The other variables remain unchanged. The specific value of `segment` is not provided, but it is implied that `total_max_segment[0]` is now greater than or equal to the previous value of `total_max_segment[0]` and `len(segment)` is not 1.
