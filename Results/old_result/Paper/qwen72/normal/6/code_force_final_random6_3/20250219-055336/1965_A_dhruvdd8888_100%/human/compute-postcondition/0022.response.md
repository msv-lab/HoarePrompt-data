Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has at least 3 elements, each element in `nums` is now 0, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums` before the loop, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, `nw` is True, and if `nums[i]` is 1, `cw` is False. Otherwise, `cw` remains True and `nums[i]` is not equal to 1.***
