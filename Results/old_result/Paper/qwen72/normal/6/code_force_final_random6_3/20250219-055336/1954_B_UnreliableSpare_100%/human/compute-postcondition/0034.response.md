Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to their previous element, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 1 or 2 if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value between the initial `ans` and `cnt`.**
