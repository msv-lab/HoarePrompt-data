Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`. If `ele` < 0 and `c` <= `abs(ele)`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `ele` and 0.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`. However, the initial state already specifies the conditions under which `c` and `maxi` are set. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` and `maxi` remain 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `ele` and 0. Since the initial state already accounts for these conditions, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
