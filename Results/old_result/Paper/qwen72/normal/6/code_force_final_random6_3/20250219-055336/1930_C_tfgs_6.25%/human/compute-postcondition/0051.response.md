Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers where each integer `a_i` was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been increased by `i + 1` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`), and `a` is now sorted in descending order, `a` must have at least two elements, `i` is 2, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated and now unique list `a`, but the count of `a[0]` is decreased by 1, `cnt` is the difference between `n` and the length of `a`, if `i` > 0, `cnt` is the difference between `n` and the length of `a` minus `adv`, and `cnt` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`), the values from `a[0] - 1` to `a[0] - adv`, and the new value `a[1] - 1`, `adv` is the minimum value among `a[1] - a[2] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[1]]`, and `adv` must be greater than 0, `j` is 2, `counter[a[0]]` is decreased by `adv`, `counter[a[1]]` is decreased by 1, and `counter[a[1]]` is now `counter[a[1]] - 1, `ans` now includes the value `a[1] - 2`, and `ans` has a new element `a[1] - 3`.**
