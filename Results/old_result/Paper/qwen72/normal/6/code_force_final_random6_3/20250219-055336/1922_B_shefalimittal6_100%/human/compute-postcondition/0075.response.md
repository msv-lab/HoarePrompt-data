Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` remains the integer value of `data[n + 2]` and must be greater than 0, `t` remains `t - 1`, `idx` remains `n + n + 3`, `data` remains a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` remains a list containing a single string representation of `ans`, `v` remains a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each `v[x]` (for each `x` read from `data` starting from index `n + 3` to `n + n + 2`) is incremented by 1, `cnt` remains `cnt + v[i]`, `x` remains the integer value of `data[n + n + 2]`, `_` remains `n - 1`, `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, and if `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `v[i]` remains greater than or equal to 3. Otherwise, `v[i]` is less than 3.**
