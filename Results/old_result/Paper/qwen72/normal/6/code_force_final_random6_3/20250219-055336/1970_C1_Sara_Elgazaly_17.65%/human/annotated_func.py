#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` does not take any parameters, but it is implied that the input is provided through standard input or another method outside the function. The input consists of: the first line containing two integers n and t, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 and t=1; the next n-1 lines containing two integers u and v each, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, representing the edges of the tree; and the last line containing a single integer u_1, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    lst = defaultdict(list)
    for _ in range(x - 1):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        lst[a].append(b)
        
        lst[b].append(a)
        
    #State: `x` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `_` is `x - 2`, `a` and `b` are input integers, `lst[a]` is a list that now includes `b` `x - 1` times, `lst[b]` is a list that now includes `a` `x - 1` times.
    s = True
    while lst[x] != []:
        while lst[x]:
            y = lst[x].pop()
            if lst[y] != []:
                x = y
                break
        
        s = not s
        
    #State: The loop will continue to execute until `lst[x]` is empty for all `x` values that are encountered. After all iterations, `x` will be the last non-empty `y` value from the list `lst[x]` before the loop terminated, `lst[x]` will be empty, `s` will be the opposite of its initial value (True), and all other variables (`a`, `b`, `_`) will remain unchanged.
    s = not s
    print('Hermione' if s else 'Ron')
    #This is printed: Ron
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input describing a tree with `n` nodes and a starting node `u_1`. It then processes the tree structure to determine a final state, which is used to decide between two outcomes: 'Hermione' or 'Ron'. The function prints 'Ron' at the end, regardless of the input tree structure or starting node.
