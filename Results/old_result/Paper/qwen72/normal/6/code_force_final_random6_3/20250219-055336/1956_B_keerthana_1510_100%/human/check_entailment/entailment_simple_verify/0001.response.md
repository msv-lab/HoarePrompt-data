Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, you and Nene, each receiving `n` cards from a deck of `2n` cards.
   - Each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice in the deck.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases `t`.
   - The program processes every second line starting from the second line, which contains the card values in your hand for each test case.
   - This approach is correct because the first line of each test case contains the value of `n`, and the second line contains the card values.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program splits the line containing the card values into tokens.
   - It then calculates the number of unique card values in your hand using a set.
   - The score you can achieve is the total number of cards in your hand minus the number of unique card values.
   - The expression `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` correctly calculates the number of duplicates in your hand, which is the maximum number of points you can score.

4. **Explanation**:
   - If you have a card value that appears twice in your hand, you can score a point for the second card if Nene hasn't played the matching card yet.
   - The number of points you can score is the number of duplicate card values in your hand.
   - The expression `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` correctly calculates the number of duplicates in your hand, which is the maximum number of points you can score.

5. **Optimality**:
   - Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
   - If you have a card value that appears twice, Nene will play the matching card as soon as possible to prevent you from scoring.
   - Therefore, the program's logic correctly reflects the optimal strategy for both players.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where all card values in your hand are unique, resulting in a score of 0.
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

7. **Input Validation**:
   - The program assumes that the input is well-formed and follows the constraints provided in the problem description.
   - The input parsing logic `[*open(0)][2::2]` correctly skips the lines containing `n` and processes only the lines with card values.

8. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct number of points for each test case as required by the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct in terms of its logic and handling of the problem constraints. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
