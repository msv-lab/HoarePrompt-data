Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the second character of `s`, `win` is a set containing the first character of `s` and the second character of `s`, `ans` is an empty list, and `ps` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `win.add(i)` adds the second character of `s` to the set `win`.
- If `i` is in `us` and `len(win) != k`, then `win` was initially a set containing the first character of `s`, and now it contains both the first and second characters of `s`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, and `us` remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans` remains an empty list.
- The value of `ps` remains 2.
