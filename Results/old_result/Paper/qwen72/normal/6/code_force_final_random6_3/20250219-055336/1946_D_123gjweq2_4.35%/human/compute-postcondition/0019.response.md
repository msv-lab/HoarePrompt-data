Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the value `xor` if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, otherwise `new_arr` is a list containing the value `xor` (regardless of the bit at position `bit`), `xor` is the result of `xor` XOR `i`, `thing1` is 0.** 

In natural language: The code appends the value of `xor` to the list `new_arr`. The value of `xor` is the result of XORing the third element in `cur_arr` with the previous value of `xor`. The other variables remain unchanged. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` was 0, `new_arr` now contains `xor`. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` was 1, `new_arr` still contains `xor` because the code appends `xor` regardless of the bit condition.
