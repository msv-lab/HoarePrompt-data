Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 1, `mid` is (`n` - 1) // 2.**

The variable `mid` is assigned the value of the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2, which is (`n` - 1) // 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
