To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to consider the condition in the loop head: `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`. The variables `i` and `arr` are the only ones that can be adjusted to meet this condition.

Given the state right before the loop:
- If the loop completes all iterations, then `i` is `len(arr) // 2` and `j` is `len(arr) // 2 - 1` if `len(arr)` is even, or `i` is `len(arr) // 2 + 1` and `j` is `len(arr) // 2 - 1` if `len(arr)` is odd.
- If the loop breaks early, then `i` and `j` are the indices where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`.
- Additionally, `i` is less than or equal to `j`.

To make the loop execute at least once, we need to ensure that `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. Since `i` is less than or equal to `j`, and `j` is at most `len(arr) // 2 - 1` (for even length) or `len(arr) // 2 - 1` (for odd length), `i` must be less than `len(arr) - 1` to avoid an index out of range error when accessing `arr[i + 1]`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that:
- `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`
- `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`

Since the initial state does not specify the values of `arr` or the exact value of `i`, we can assume that `i` is at a valid index and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]` to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

State: **`i` is less than `len(arr) - 1` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`**
