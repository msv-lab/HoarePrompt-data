Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n`, `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[n - 2]` is `n`, `ind` is equal to `n - 4`, and an `IndexError` occurs.**

Explanation:
- `ind` is initially `n - 2`.
- The code `ind -= 2` decrements `ind` by 2, so `ind` becomes `n - 4`.
- The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `p`) remain unchanged.
- Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `ind` is now `n - 4`, which is less than `n - 2`.
- An `IndexError` occurs because `ind` is now out of the valid index range for the list `p`.
