Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` must be at least 3, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is the index where the first pair of consecutive elements differ (or `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking), `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 1, `cn` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cn` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially 2, it becomes 3.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
