Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the provided function definition does not include them. The correct function definition should include parameters `t` and `cases`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `cases` is a list of test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` of length `n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
