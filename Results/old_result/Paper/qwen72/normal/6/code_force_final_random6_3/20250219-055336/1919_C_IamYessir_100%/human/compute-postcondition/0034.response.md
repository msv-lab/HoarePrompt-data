Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list with `lit[i]` appended to it, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[i]`), `y` is infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is less than `y`, and the current value of `x` is greater than or equal to the value of `lit[i]`.**
