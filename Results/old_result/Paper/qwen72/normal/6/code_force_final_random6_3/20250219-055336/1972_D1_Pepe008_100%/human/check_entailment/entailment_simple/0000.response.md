Reasoning:  
The program is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions given. However, there are several issues with the implementation that suggest the program is not correct:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `x`**: The formula used to calculate `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\). This formula does not directly relate to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The correct approach should involve checking the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

2. **Incorrect Condition for Adding 1 to `suma`**: The additional condition `if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is not relevant to the problem. The condition \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) is always false for \(i > 1\) because \(i \cdot (i - 1)\) is not divisible by \(i^2\) when \(i > 1\).

3. **Subtracting 2 from `suma`**: The program subtracts 2 from `suma` at the end, which is not justified by the problem statement. This subtraction is likely incorrect and would affect the final result.

4. **Efficiency and Correctness**: The loop iterates over all values of \(i\) from 1 to \(b\), which is not efficient for large values of \(b\) (up to \(2 \times 10^6\)). Additionally, the logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the required condition.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
