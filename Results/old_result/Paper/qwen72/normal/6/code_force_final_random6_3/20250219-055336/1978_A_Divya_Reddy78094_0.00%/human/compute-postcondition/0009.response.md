The code snippet `nums.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `nums` in descending order. Since `nums` is already a list of integers sorted in descending order, this operation does not change the order of the elements in `nums`. The values of `t`, `_`, and `n` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
