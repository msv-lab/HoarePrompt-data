To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the variables and conditions that are directly involved in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(n):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and equal to `t`
- `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user
- `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in `arr`
- `first` is False
- `i` is 1
- If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken
- If `mpp[i]` is 1, `first` is set to True
- Otherwise, the state remains unchanged

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
- `n` remains the same, as it is the upper limit of the range and does not change during the loop.

The conditions for the loop to execute again are:
- `i` must be less than `n`.

Since `n` is greater than 0 and equal to `t`, and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again (because `i` is now 2).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and equal to `t`, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is False, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**.
