Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer between 2 and 676, inclusive.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is the first input integer.
   - `k` is the second input integer.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` is a fixed string containing all the lowercase letters of the English alphabet.
   - The slice `[:k]` takes the first `k` characters from this string.
   - The `* n` operation repeats the resulting string `n` times.
   - The `print` statement outputs the final repeated string.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - Since `k` is the second input integer, it determines how many characters are taken from the alphabet string.
   - Since `n` is the first input integer, it determines how many times the resulting string is repeated.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The output will be the first `k` characters of the alphabet string repeated `n` times.

Output: **'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n (where 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] is the first k characters of the alphabet string and n is the first input integer)**
