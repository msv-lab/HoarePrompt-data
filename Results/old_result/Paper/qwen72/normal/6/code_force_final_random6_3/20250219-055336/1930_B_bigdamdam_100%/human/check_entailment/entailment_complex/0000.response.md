### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the length of the permutation `p`.

2. **Permutation Generation**:
   - The function initializes a list `p` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It then fills the even indices of `p` with the largest even numbers in descending order, starting from `n` and decrementing by 2.
   - It fills the odd indices of `p` with the smallest odd numbers in ascending order, starting from 1 and incrementing by 2.

3. **Validation**:
   - The generated permutation `p` ensures that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) exist such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - This is because the even indices are filled with large numbers in descending order, and the odd indices are filled with small numbers in ascending order. This pattern breaks any potential divisibility relationships between consecutive elements.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the generated permutation `p` for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the minimum value of `n` (3) correctly.
   - The function also handles larger values of `n` up to 10^5, as specified in the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly generates a permutation `p` for each test case that meets the problem's requirements. The permutation ensures that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` exist such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`. The input handling and output are also correct.
