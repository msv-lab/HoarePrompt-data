Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, with each integer from 1 to n appearing at most twice, and the input to file descriptor `0` must contain at least 2t + 1 lines.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5.
- The list `a` remains a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` is between 1 and `n`, and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice.
- The input to file descriptor `0` must contain at least `2t + 1` lines to ensure that the loop executes `t` times. This is because the loop skips every other line starting from the third line, so it needs `2t + 1` lines to process `t` lines.
