The objects in the loop head are `i` and `arr`. The loop will execute again if there is another element in `arr` to be assigned to `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first element of `arr`, and `arr` had at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least two elements, and `i` will be the second element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 1, `ans` is a list containing a single element which is `1 << i`, and `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
