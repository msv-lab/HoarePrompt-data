Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their previous elements.
   - `sz` is `min(k, 2 * len(rdb))`.
   - The loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(rdb))` elements of `rdb` twice each.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop has been exited.
   - If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then the loop has printed additional elements up to `k` times.
   - `sng` must have at least 1 element.
   - `elem` is the first element in `sng`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `elem` is explicitly defined as the first element in the list `sng`.
   - Since `sng` must have at least 1 element, `elem` is guaranteed to have a value.
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be the value of `elem` followed by a space.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the first element in the list sng)**
