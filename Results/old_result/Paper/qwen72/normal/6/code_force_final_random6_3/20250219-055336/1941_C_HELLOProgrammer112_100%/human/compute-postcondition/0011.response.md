Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`, `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`**

The code snippet `y = s.count('pie')` updates the value of `y` to the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the string `s`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
