To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `costs`.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is greater than 0. This means `len(costs)` must be at least `k`.
2. **Initial State of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0, as it is the starting point of the `range` function.
3. **State of `costs`**: `costs` must be a list with at least `k` elements for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values of the first four integers read from the standard input.
- `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers.
- `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of applying `func_1` to the corresponding row in `rows` with the parameter `d`.

We need to ensure that `len(costs)` is at least `k` for the loop to execute. Since `costs` is derived from `rows` and `func_1`, and `rows` has `n` elements, `costs` will also have `n` elements. Therefore, `n` must be at least `k`.

State: **`n` must be at least `k`, `i` is 0, `costs` is a list of length `n`**
