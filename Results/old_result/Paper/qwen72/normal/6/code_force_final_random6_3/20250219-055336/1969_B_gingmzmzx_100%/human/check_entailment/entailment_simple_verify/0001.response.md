### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to determine the minimum total cost to cyclically shift substrings of a binary string to make it sorted in non-descending order.
   - The cost of a shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of all shifts.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a binary string.
   - The output is the minimum total cost for each test case.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `s` and converts it to a list of integers.
   - It counts the number of zeroes in the string `s`.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.
   - It iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - If `c` is 0, it adds 1 to `ans` if there are any 1s before it (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`).
     - If `c` is 1, it adds the number of remaining zeroes to `ans` (i.e., `zeroes - cnt[0]`).
   - Finally, it prints the total cost `ans` for each test case.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string.
   - The key insight is that the cost of sorting a binary string is the sum of the lengths of the substrings that need to be shifted to move all 1s to the right of all 0s.
   - The program correctly counts the number of 0s and 1s and calculates the cost based on the positions of 1s and 0s in the string.
   - The logic for adding to `ans` is correct:
     - When encountering a 0, if there are any 1s before it, it adds 1 to `ans` because a shift is needed to move the 1s to the right.
     - When encountering a 1, it adds the number of remaining zeroes to `ans` because each of these zeroes needs to be moved to the left of the 1.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") by outputting 0.
   - It also handles the case where the string is not sorted and needs multiple shifts to become sorted (e.g., "101011").
   - The program correctly handles the case where the string is entirely composed of 1s or 0s.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of the program is O(n * m), where `n` is the number of test cases and `m` is the length of the string. This is efficient given the constraints.
   - The space complexity is O(m) for storing the list representation of the string `s`.

### Validation Using Annotations:
- **Initial State:**
  - The function `func_1` is called, and it reads the number of test cases `n`.
  - For each test case, it reads the binary string `s` and converts it to a list of integers.
  - It counts the number of zeroes in the string `s`.

- **Loop State:**
  - The program iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`.
  - It updates the counter `cnt` based on the current character.
  - It updates `ans` based on the current character and the counts of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
  - The annotations confirm that `ans` is correctly calculated as the total number of pairs `(i, j)` where `s[i]` is 0 and `s[j]` is 1, and `i < j`.

- **Final State:**
  - After all iterations, `n` is 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the last input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the last `s`, `cnt` is [number of zeros in the last `s`, number of ones in the last `s`], and `ans` is the total cost for the last input string.
  - The program prints the total cost `ans` for each test case.

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using the given operations. The annotations and the reasoning provided in the original assessment are accurate.
