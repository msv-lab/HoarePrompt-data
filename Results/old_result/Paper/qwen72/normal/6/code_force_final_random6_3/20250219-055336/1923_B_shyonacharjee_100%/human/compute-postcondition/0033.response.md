Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element from the pairs formed by zipping `x` and `a` that must have at least `m + 1` tuples where `m` is the number of iterations the loop completed, `bullets_used` is equal to the sum of the health values of all the monsters that the loop iterated over, `can_survive` is True if the total bullets needed (sum of health values) for all the monsters iterated over is not greater than the product of the absolute value of the position of the last monster and `k`, otherwise `can_survive` is False.**
