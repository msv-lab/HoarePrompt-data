Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\).
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 26\).
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 26\).
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 1000\).
   - `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `win` is an empty set.
   - `ans` is a list containing the characters of `s` that were the last character to complete a set of `k` unique characters in `s`.
   - `ps` is the number of times the set `win` was cleared, and `ps` is less than `n`.
   - `i` is the second element of `us`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `ans` is a list of characters from `s` that meet a specific condition (the last character to complete a set of `k` unique characters).
   - `i` is the second element of `us`, which is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. Since `us` contains the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, the second element of `us` is the second letter in the alphabet, which is `'b'`.
   - `'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)` creates a string of `a` characters with a length of `n - len(ans) - 1`.

4. **Combining the Parts:**
   - `''.join(ans)` converts the list `ans` into a string.
   - `i` is `'b'`.
   - `'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)` adds the necessary number of `a` characters to make the total length of the string equal to `n`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The string printed will be the concatenation of the string formed by `ans`, the character `b`, and a string of `a` characters of length `n - len(ans) - 1`.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:
Output: **[joined_ans]b[a * (n - len(ans) - 1)] (where [joined_ans] is the string formed by joining the elements of the list `ans`, and [a * (n - len(ans) - 1)] is a string of `a` characters of length `n - len(ans) - 1`)**

For example, if `ans` is `['a', 'c', 'd']` and `n` is 5, the output will be:
Output: **acdab**
