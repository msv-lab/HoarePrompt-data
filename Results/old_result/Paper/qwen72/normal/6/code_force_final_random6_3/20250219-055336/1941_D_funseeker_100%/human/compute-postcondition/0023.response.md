Output State: **`n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing the value `x` and potentially other elements that have been added through the loop, `r` is an integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each element `q` in `ans`. If `c` is '0', `temp` is a set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` for each element `q` in `ans`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The variable `n` remains the same as it was initially, still constrained to 2 <= n <= 1000.
- The variable `m` remains the same as it was initially, still greater than 0.
- The variable `x` remains the same as it was initially, still constrained to 1 <= x <= n.
- The set `ans` now contains the initial value `x` and any additional elements that were added to it through the loop.
- The variable `r` remains the same as it was initially, still the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
- The variable `c` remains the same as it was initially, still the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`.
- The set `temp` contains all unique values generated by the loop. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` includes all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each element `q` in `ans`. If `c` is '0', `temp` includes only all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` for each element `q` in `ans`.
