Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` found during the loop execution.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an input integer within the specified range.
- The variable `_` is still a temporary variable used in the loop.
- The variable `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 0.
- The variable `a` is the list of integers provided by the input.
- The variable `tmp` is still equal to the first element of the list `a`.
- The variable `i` is now `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
- The variable `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop.
- The variable `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` found during the loop execution.
