Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 500 for all 1 <= i < n, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `ans[0]` which is equal to `arr[0] + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2):
    ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
    if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
        while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
            ans[i + 1] += ans[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 500 for all 1 <= i < n, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of length `n` with `ans[0]` equal to `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[1]` equal to `arr[0] + arr[0] + 1 + k * (arr[0] + 1)`, where `k` is the smallest integer such that `ans[1]` is greater than `arr[1]` if `ans[1]` was originally less than `arr[1]`. Otherwise, `ans[1]` remains equal to `arr[0] + arr[0] + 1`. `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers where \( 1 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 500 \) for all \( 1 \leq i < n \), `n` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 500 \), `ans` is a list of length `n` with `ans[0]` equal to `arr[0] + 1`, and `ans[1]` equal to `arr[0] + arr[0] + 1 + k * (arr[0] + 1)` if `ans[1]` was originally less than `arr[1]` or `arr[0] + arr[0] + 1` otherwise. If `ans[2]` was originally less than `arr[2]`, then `ans[2]` is set to `arr[1] + ans[1] * m` where `m` is the number of times the loop executed, and `arr[2]` must be greater than or equal to `arr[1] + (m-1) * 2 * arr[0] + (m-1)`. Otherwise, `ans[2]` remains equal to `arr[1] + ans[1]`. `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers where \( 1 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 500 \) for all \( 1 \leq i < n \), `n` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 500 \), `ans` is a list of length `n` with `ans[0]` equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` equal to `arr[0] + arr[0] + 1 + k * (arr[0] + 1)` if `ans[1]` was originally less than `arr[1]` or `arr[0] + arr[0] + 1` otherwise, `ans[2]` is set to `arr[1] + ans[1] * m` if `ans[2]` was originally less than `arr[2]` and `arr[2]` must be greater than or equal to `arr[1] + (m-1) * 2 * arr[0] + (m-1)`, otherwise `ans[2]` remains equal to `arr[1] + ans[1]`, `ans[3]` is equal to `arr[2] + ans[2]`, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 4. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, the loop will continue to execute until `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest value greater than `arr[i + 1]` that can be achieved by repeatedly adding `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1]`. The values of `ans[0]`, `ans[1]`, and `ans[2]` will remain unchanged, and `i` will still be 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
