Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `i` is len(arr) - 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list or a list containing the sum of the last segment of non-negative numbers and the starting index of this segment, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of non-negative numbers found during the loop and the starting index of this segment, and `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a segment of non-negative numbers, the starting index of this segment, and the ending index of this segment.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all iterations, so `i` is now `len(arr) - 1`.
- `max_sum` remains unchanged at -1.
- `new_segment` is either an empty list if the last element of `arr` is negative or a list containing the sum of the last segment of non-negative numbers and the starting index of this segment.
- `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of non-negative numbers found during the loop and the starting index of this segment.
- `segments_variants` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains the sum of a segment of non-negative numbers, the starting index of this segment, and the ending index of this segment. These segments are identified during the loop execution whenever a negative number breaks a sequence of non-negative numbers.
