Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Attacks**: The logic for handling attacks from the Kraken is flawed. The program attempts to handle attacks in pairs (first and last ship) but does not correctly simulate the sequence of attacks as described in the problem. The Kraken should attack the first ship, then the last ship, and repeat this process until it runs out of attacks or all ships have sunk.

2. **Redundant and Incomplete Conditions**: The conditions inside the `while` loop are redundant and incomplete. For example, the program checks if `l == r` and handles it, but it does not correctly handle the case where the Kraken attacks the first ship and then the last ship in a loop.

3. **Incorrect Durability Reduction**: The program incorrectly reduces the durability of the ships. It sometimes reduces the durability of the last ship by the durability of the first ship, which is not how the problem specifies the attacks should work.

4. **Breaking Out of the Loop**: The program has multiple `break` statements that are not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. The loop should continue until all attacks are made or all ships have sunk.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, k, a):
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    sunks = 0
    while k > 0 and l <= r:
        if a[l] <= k:
            k -= a[l]
            a[l] = 0
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
        else:
            a[l] -= k
            k = 0
            break
        
        if l <= r and a[r] <= k:
            k -= a[r]
            a[r] = 0
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
        else:
            a[r] -= k
            k = 0
            break
    
    return sunks

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, k, a))
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `l` and `r` are initialized to the first and last indices of the list `a`, respectively. `sunks` is initialized to 0 to count the number of sunk ships.
- **Loop**: The loop continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and there are ships to attack (`l <= r`).
- **First Ship Attack**: If the durability of the first ship (`a[l]`) is less than or equal to the remaining attacks (`k`), the ship is sunk, and the attack count is reduced by the ship's durability. The index `l` is then incremented to move to the next ship.
- **Last Ship Attack**: Similarly, if the durability of the last ship (`a[r]`) is less than or equal to the remaining attacks (`k`), the ship is sunk, and the attack count is reduced by the ship's durability. The index `r` is then decremented to move to the previous ship.
- **Return**: The function returns the number of sunk ships.

This corrected version should correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks and count the number of sunk ships.
