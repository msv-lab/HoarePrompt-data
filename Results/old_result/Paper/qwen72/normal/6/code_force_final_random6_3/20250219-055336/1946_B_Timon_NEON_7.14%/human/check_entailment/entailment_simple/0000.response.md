### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`, followed by the array `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is responsible for returning the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It correctly takes an integer `number` and returns `number % 1000000007`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray of positive integers.
   - However, there are several issues in the implementation:
     - The function initializes `max_segment` and `new_segment` as lists with a single element, which is not a standard way to handle sums and indices.
     - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers.
     - The function appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` even if they are empty or contain invalid data.
     - The final check to set `total_max_segment` to `[-1]` if its length is 1 is unnecessary and incorrect.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic calculates the answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - This formula assumes that `max_segment[0]` is the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray of positive integers.
   - However, due to the issues in `func_2`, `max_segment[0]` may not be correctly computed, leading to incorrect results.

5. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function is defined but not used in the program.
   - It is incomplete and does not contribute to the solution.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the implementation of `func_2` and the main logic, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
