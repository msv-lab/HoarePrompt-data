Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`, `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in the new `s`**

The variable `s` is updated to a new input string. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are recalculated based on the new `s`. The other variables (`int(input())`, `_`, `a`) remain unchanged.
