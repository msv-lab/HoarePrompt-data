Postcondition: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n`, `ul` is increased by 2 for each element in `a` from index 0 to the index where the condition `ul == k * 2` is first met, and the corresponding elements in `l` at indices `a[j] - 1` are set to 0 for each `j` from 0 to that index, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`, and `k` is not zero.**
