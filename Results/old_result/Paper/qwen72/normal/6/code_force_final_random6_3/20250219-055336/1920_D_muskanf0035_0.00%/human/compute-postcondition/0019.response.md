Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are specific positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, and the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each execution, `operations` is a list of `n` lists containing integers from the input, `queries` is a list of integers from the input, and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`. The variable `_` has been incremented `t` times, and `t` is now equal to the number of times the loop has executed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` has been fully utilized, and the loop has executed exactly `t` times. For each of these `t` iterations, the variables `n` and `q` were specific positive integers within the given constraints, `operations` was a list of `n` lists of integers, `queries` was a list of integers, and `result` was the output of the function `func_1` for that specific set of inputs. The loop variable `_` has been incremented `t` times, and the loop has finished executing. The constraints on the sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases remain unchanged.
