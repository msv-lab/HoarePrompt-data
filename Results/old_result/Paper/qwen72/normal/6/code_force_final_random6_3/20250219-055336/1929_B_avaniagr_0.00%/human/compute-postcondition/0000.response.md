The only objects in the loop head are the variable `s` and the list created by `[*open(0)][1:]`, so we can only adjust those. The loop iterates over the elements of the list created by `[*open(0)][1:]`, which means the list must have at least one element for the loop to execute. The list is created by reading from file descriptor 0 (standard input), skipping the first line.

For the loop to execute, the list must have at least one element, which means there must be at least one line in the input after the first line.

State: **`[*open(0)][1:]` must have at least 1 element, `s` is the first element in the list `[*open(0)][1:]`**
