The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `tree`, `v`, and `x`. `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class containing at least `v` as a vertex. `v` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, and `x` is a positive integer. The function returns two values: `good_components` and `remaining_size`.

- `good_components` is the sum of all `good_components_subtree` values for each child of vertex `v` plus the number of children whose `remaining_size_subtree` is greater than or equal to `x`.
- `remaining_size` is 1 plus the sum of all `remaining_size_subtree` values for children whose `remaining_size_subtree` is less than `x`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a `Tree` instance `tree`, a non-negative integer `v` representing a vertex in the tree, and a positive integer `x`. It returns two values: `good_components`, which is the sum of `good_components_subtree` values for each child of `v` plus the number of children with `remaining_size_subtree` â‰¥ `x`, and `remaining_size`, which is 1 plus the sum of `remaining_size_subtree` values for children with `remaining_size_subtree` < `x`.**
