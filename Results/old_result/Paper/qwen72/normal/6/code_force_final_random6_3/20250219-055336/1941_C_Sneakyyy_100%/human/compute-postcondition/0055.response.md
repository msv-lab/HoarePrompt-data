Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is the new input string, `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' or 'pie' appears in `a`, and `i` is the length of `a` minus 2.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reassigns `n` to a new input integer, which is still greater than 0. The other variables (`a`, `ans`, and `i`) are not affected by this code, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.
