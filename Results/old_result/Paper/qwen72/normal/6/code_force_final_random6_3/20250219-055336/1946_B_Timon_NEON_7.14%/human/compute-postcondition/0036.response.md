Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[0]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is set to [first element of `arr`, 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1]]. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to [arr[1], 1], `max_segment` is set to [arr[0], 0], and `segments_variants` remains an empty list.***
