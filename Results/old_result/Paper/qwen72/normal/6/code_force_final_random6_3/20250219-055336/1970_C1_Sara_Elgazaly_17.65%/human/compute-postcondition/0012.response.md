Output State: **`x` is an integer between 3 and 2Ã—10^5, `_` is 2, `a` and `b` are input integers, `lst[a]` is a list that now includes `b` three times, `lst[b]` is a list that now includes `a` three times.** 

The value of `lst[a]` has been updated by appending `b` to it, making `b` appear three times in `lst[a]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
