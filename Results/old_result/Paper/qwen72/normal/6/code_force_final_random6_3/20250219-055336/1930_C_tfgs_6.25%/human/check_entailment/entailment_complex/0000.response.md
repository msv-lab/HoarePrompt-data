### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Modification:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array `a` and the elements of `a`.
   - It then modifies each element `a[i]` by adding `i + 1` to it. This step is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Set and Counter Operations:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each modified element in `a`.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts the set in descending order.
   - This ensures that the elements in `a` are unique and sorted in descending order, which is necessary for constructing the lexicographically largest array `b`.

3. **Gap Filling:**
   - The program initializes a list `ans` to store the final result.
   - It iterates over the sorted unique elements of `a` and fills gaps between consecutive elements to ensure the length of `ans` is `n`.
   - The gap filling is done by appending elements that are one less than the previous element, ensuring that the elements are unique and in descending order.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - After processing the unique elements, if there are still elements to be added to `ans` (i.e., `cnt` is not zero), it appends the necessary elements to `ans` to make its length equal to `n`.
   - This step ensures that the final array `b` has exactly `n` elements.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` in a space-separated format, which is the correct output format according to the problem description.

### Correctness:
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles the input and output as required. It ensures that the elements are unique and sorted in descending order, and it fills gaps appropriately to construct the lexicographically largest array `b`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
