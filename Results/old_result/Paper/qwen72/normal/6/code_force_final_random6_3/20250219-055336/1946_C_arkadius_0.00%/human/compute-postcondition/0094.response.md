Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the value of the first element popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains one element fewer than before and must still contain at least one element. If `postorder` is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` have been fully iterated over, and `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is now equal to the sum of `good_components` of all its children plus the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. Additionally, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to the sum of the `remaining_size` of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. If `postorder` is False, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have been fully iterated over, and `stack` now contains tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v` appended to it in the order they were iterated.***
