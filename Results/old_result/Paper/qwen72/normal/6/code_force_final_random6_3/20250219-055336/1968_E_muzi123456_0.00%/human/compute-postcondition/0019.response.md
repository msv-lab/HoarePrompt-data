Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 49) and is now `t - 2` with `t` being at least 0.
- `n` is a new input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3).
- `i` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the string `'1'`.
- The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function specifies that the output should be followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Variables and Objects:
- The value of `t` is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.
- The value of `n` is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.
- The value of `i` is 1, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the string `'1'` followed by a space.

Output: **1 **
