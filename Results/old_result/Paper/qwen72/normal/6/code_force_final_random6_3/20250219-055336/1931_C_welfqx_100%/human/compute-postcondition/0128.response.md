Output State: **`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of `num` that are equal, up to `n - 1`. If all elements in `onum` are equal, `ck` is `n - 1`. If `symb1` and `symb2` are equal, `cn` is increased by `ck`, `r` is `t - 1`, `t` must be greater than `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`.
- The value of `n` is now an input integer.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
