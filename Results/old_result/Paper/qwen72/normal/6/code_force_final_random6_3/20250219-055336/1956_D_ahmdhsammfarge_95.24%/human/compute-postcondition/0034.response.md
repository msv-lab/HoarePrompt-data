The values of `r` and `l` are updated to be equal to `i` and `j` respectively. The values of `i` and `j` are 1 and 4, so `r` is now 1 and `l` is now 4. The other variables (`lst`, `n`, `sm`, and `over_sum`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 <= n <= 18` and `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except `lst[1]`, `lst[2]`, and `lst[3]` plus 25, `r` is 1, `l` is 4, and if `sm` > `over_sum`, then `r` is 1, `l` is 3, and `over_sum` is updated to be equal to `sm`. Otherwise, `r` remains 0 and `over_sum` remains unchanged.**
