The code snippet provided is simply `print('Yes')`. This statement will print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the initial state or any conditions described.

However, to address the initial state and conditions provided:
- `_` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input.
- `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input.
- The condition checks if the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`. If it is, the condition is met; otherwise, it is not.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables or conditions, it will always print the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
