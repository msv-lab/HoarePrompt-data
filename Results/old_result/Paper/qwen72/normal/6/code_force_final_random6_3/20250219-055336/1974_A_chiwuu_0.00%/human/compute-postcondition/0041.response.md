Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1 >= a`, the program retains the values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, and `t1` as described. Otherwise, `t2` is `a - t1`, and if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`. If `t2 % 15 != 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15) + 1`.** 

The code snippet `a = int(a)` converts the value of `a` to an integer, which was already an integer as per the initial state. Therefore, the value of `a` remains unchanged. All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain valid and unchanged.
