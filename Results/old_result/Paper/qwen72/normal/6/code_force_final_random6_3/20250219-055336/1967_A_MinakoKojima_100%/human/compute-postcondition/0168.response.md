Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans_list` contains `a[0]` and `a[0]`, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `dif` is the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]`. If `dif` is 0, `ans` remains `a[0]`, `k` remains the second integer from the input, and `res` is `n - 2`. If `dif` is not 0, `res` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the initial condition, and the function may break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
