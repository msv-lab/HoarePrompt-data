The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18). The function then checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If so, it prints 'YES' followed by two lines containing the number 1. If `n` is not equal to `k` but `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, it prints 'YES' followed by two lines: the first line contains `n - k + 1` and the second line contains 1. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, `_` being `t - 1`, and `n` and `k` being the last set of input integers for the final test case.
