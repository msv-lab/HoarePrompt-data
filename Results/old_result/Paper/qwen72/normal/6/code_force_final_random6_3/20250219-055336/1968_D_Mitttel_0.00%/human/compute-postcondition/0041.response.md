The code snippet `results.append(result)` adds the value of `result` to the list `results`. The value of `result` is the result returned by the function `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`. The other variables remain unchanged, but the list `results` now contains one additional element.

Output State: **`index` is 13 + 6 * `n`, `input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the most recent `result`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4 - n]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3 - n]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2 - n]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1 - n]`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[index - n:index]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `t` is decreased by 1, and `results` now includes the most recent `result`.**
