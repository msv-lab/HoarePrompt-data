Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times to process each test case. Inside the loop, it reads two integers `a` and `b` for each test case, which represent the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).
   - The calculation `t = b * 2` is used to determine the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons, assuming each 2x2 icon takes up 2 screens (since 4 cells fit into 2 screens of 15 cells each).
   - The program then checks if `t % 5 == 0` to see if the total number of screens required for 2x2 icons is a multiple of 5. If it is, it sets `t` to `t // 5`. If not, it sets `t` to `t // 5 + 1`. This is correct because each screen can hold 15 cells, and `t` is the total number of cells needed for 2x2 icons, so it needs to be divided by 15 to get the number of screens.

3. **Remaining Cells for 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program calculates `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which represents the total number of cells available after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1 >= a`, it means there are enough cells left to place all 1x1 icons, so the number of screens `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `t1 < a`, it calculates the additional number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. The calculation `t2 = a - t1` determines the number of additional cells needed.
   - The program then checks if `t2 % 15 == 0` to see if the additional cells needed can be exactly filled by the remaining screens. If so, it adds `t2 // 15` screens. If not, it adds `t2 // 15 + 1` screens to account for the partial screen needed.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where `a` or `b` are zero correctly.
   - It also handles the case where no icons are present (`a = 0` and `b = 0`), correctly outputting `0` screens.

6. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons and then the remaining screens for 1x1 icons is correct.

However, there is a small issue in the initial calculation for 2x2 icons. The program assumes that each 2x2 icon takes up 2 screens, which is not accurate. Each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, so the correct calculation should be:

- `t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15` to account for the total number of cells needed for 2x2 icons and then divide by 15 to get the number of screens, rounding up if necessary.

Given this, the program is almost correct but has a minor flaw in the initial calculation for 2x2 icons. The correct calculation should be:

```python
t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15
```

This ensures that the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is correctly calculated, even if the total number of cells needed is not a multiple of 15.

Correctness: **False**
