Let's break down the task step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print(cost)` statement.

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be at least 1.
2. `_` is not explicitly set before the loop but will be assigned values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop's execution.
3. `L` is a list of integers provided by the user.
4. `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
5. `n` is the length of `N`.
6. `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
7. `k` is equal to `L[2]`.
8. `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.

### Conditions and Calculations:
- If `n * m` is equal to `k`:
  - `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`.
  - `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- Otherwise, if `n * m` is not equal to `k`:
  - `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M`.
  - `w` is the last element of the original `N`.
  - `mu` is `k - (q-2) * m`.
  - `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `m` and `k`**:
   - `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
   - `k` is `L[2]`.

2. **Calculate `q`**:
   - `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. This means `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / m`.

3. **Check the condition `n * m == k`**:
   - If `n * m` is equal to `k`:
     - `N` contains the first `q` elements of `M`.
     - `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - If `n * m` is not equal to `k`:
     - `N` contains the first `q-1` elements of `M`.
     - `w` is the last element of the original `N`.
     - `mu` is `k - (q-2) * m`.
     - `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

### Final Output:
The `print(cost)` statement will print the value of `cost` based on the conditions and calculations described above. Since the exact values of `L` and `M` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cost`. However, we can describe the value of `cost` in terms of the given variables and conditions.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the conditions and formulas provided in the initial state)**

### Detailed Description:
- If `n * m == k`:
  - `N` contains the first `q` elements of `M`.
  - `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- Otherwise:
  - `N` contains the first `q-1` elements of `M`.
  - `w` is the last element of the original `N`.
  - `mu = k - (q-2) * m`.
  - `cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

This output provides a clear and precise description of what will be printed based on the initial state and the given conditions.
