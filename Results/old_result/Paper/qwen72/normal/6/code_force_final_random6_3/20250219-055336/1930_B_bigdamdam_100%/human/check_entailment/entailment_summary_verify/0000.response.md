### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the length of the permutation.

2. **Permutation Generation**:
   - The function initializes a list `p` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then populates the list `p` in two steps:
     - First, it fills the even indices of `p` with the largest remaining numbers in descending order, starting from `n` and decrementing by 2.
     - Second, it fills the odd indices of `p` with the smallest remaining numbers in ascending order, starting from 1 and incrementing by 2.

3. **Validation of Permutation**:
   - The permutation generated by the function is a valid permutation of length `n` because it contains all integers from 1 to `n` exactly once.
   - The function ensures that no two consecutive elements in the permutation can both divide each other, which is a key requirement of the problem.

4. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - By alternating the placement of the largest and smallest remaining numbers, the function ensures that no two consecutive elements can both be divisors of each other.
   - For example, if `n = 4`, the permutation generated is `[4, 1, 2, 3]`. Here, no two consecutive elements can both divide each other:
     - `4` does not divide `1`, and `1` does not divide `2`.
     - `2` does not divide `3`, and `3` does not divide `4`.
   - Similarly, for `n = 3`, the permutation generated is `[3, 1, 2]`, which also meets the criteria.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the minimum constraint `n = 3` correctly, generating a valid permutation.
   - The function also handles the maximum constraint `n = 10^5` correctly, as the alternating pattern ensures that the permutation is valid for any `n` within the given range.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly generates a permutation `p` of length `n` such that no two indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) exist where `p[i]` divides `p[j]` and `p[i+1]` divides `p[j+1]`. The approach used in the program is sound and meets all the problem constraints.

Final: **True**
