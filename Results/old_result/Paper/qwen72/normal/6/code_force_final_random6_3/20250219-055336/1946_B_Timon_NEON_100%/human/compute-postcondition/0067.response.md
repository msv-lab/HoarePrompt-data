Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `i` is len(arr) - 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is a list containing the sum of the last segment of non-negative numbers and the starting index of this segment, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of non-negative numbers found during the loop and the starting index of this segment, `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a segment of non-negative numbers, the starting index of this segment, and the ending index of this segment, and `total_max_segment` is the segment in `segments_variants` with the highest sum, provided that the segment has more than one element. If no such segment is found, `total_max_segment` remains [-1].**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the state of the variables is as follows:
- `arr` remains the same list of integers as it was initially.
- `i` is still `len(arr) - 1`.
- `max_sum` remains -1.
- `new_segment` is still a list containing the sum of the last segment of non-negative numbers and the starting index of this segment.
- `max_segment` is still a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of non-negative numbers found during the loop and the starting index of this segment.
- `segments_variants` is a list of lists, where each list contains the sum of a segment of non-negative numbers, the starting index of this segment, and the ending index of this segment.
- `total_max_segment` is updated to the segment in `segments_variants` that has the highest sum, provided that the segment has more than one element. If no such segment is found, `total_max_segment` remains `[-1]`.
