The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `int(input())` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented by 1, so `_` will be 1. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`, `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`**
