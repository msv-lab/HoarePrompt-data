The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, and `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `int(input())` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`, `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`**
