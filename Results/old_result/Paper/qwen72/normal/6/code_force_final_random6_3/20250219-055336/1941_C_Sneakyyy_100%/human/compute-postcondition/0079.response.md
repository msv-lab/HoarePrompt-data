Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is the new input string, `ans` is the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, and `i` is the final index after the loop has completed, which is `len(a) - 2` or greater.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the variable `ans` will contain the total count of how many times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' appear in the input string `a`. The variable `i` will be the index at which the loop stopped, which is at least `len(a) - 2` (the last possible starting index for a 3-character substring). The variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
