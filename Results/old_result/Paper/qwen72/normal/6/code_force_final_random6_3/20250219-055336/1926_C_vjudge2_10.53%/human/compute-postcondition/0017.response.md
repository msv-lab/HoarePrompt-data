Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except `values[0]` which is 0, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code snippet `total += i` adds the value of `i` to `total`. Since `i` is 0, `total` remains unchanged at 0. The states of the other variables (`t`, `_`, `numbers`, `values`, `sum_values`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
