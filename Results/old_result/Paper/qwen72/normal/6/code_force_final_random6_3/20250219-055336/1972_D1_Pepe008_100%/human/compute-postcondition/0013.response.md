To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:
```python
for i in range(1, b + 1):
```
The variables in the loop head are `i` and `b`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
   - `T` is greater than 0.
   - `t` is 0.
   - `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`.
   - `b` is at least 1.
   - `x` is the result of the expression \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i\).

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `b` inclusive.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `i_prev`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `i` must still be less than or equal to `b`.

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - `b` must remain the same or be adjusted if necessary, but in this case, it is given that `b` is at least 1 and does not change between iterations.

4. **New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `b` remains the same.

### Final State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
- `T` is greater than 0.
- `t` is 0.
- `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`.
- `b` is at least 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `x` is the result of the expression \((a - (i + 1) \times i) // (i + 1)\).

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is the result of the expression \((a - (i + 1) \times i) // (i + 1)\)**.
