Postcondition: **`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of `num` that are equal, up to `n - 1`, `cn` is increased by `ck` if `symb1` and `symb2` are equal, `r` is `t - 1`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1 if all elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is `n - 2`, and either `n` is 1 or `f` is 1.**
