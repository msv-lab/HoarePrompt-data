The code snippet `cnt = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `cnt`. This does not affect the values of the other variables, so they remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + n + 3`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is a list containing a single string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each `v[x]` (for each `x` read from `data` starting from index `n + 3` to `n + n + 2`) is incremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 2]` and must be greater than 0, `cnt` is 0, `i` is `n`, `x` is the integer value of `data[n + n + 2]`, `_` is `n - 1`.**
