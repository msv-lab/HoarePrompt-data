Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 1, and `cnt` is 1 or 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `ans` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and 0, which is 0.**

Explanation:
- `cnt` is incremented by 1, so if `a[i]` was equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is now 2. If `a[i]` was not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is now 1.
- The value of `ans` remains the same if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, which is `n`.
- If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and 0, which is 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `i`) remain unchanged.
