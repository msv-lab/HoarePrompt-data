### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and must reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot makes two moves each second: one move of its own choice and one move along the arrow in the current cell.
   - The arrows in the grid can only point left or right, and the robot cannot move outside the grid.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The robot must eventually move to the second row to reach (2, n).
   - The robot can only move to the second row by moving down from the first row.
   - Once in the second row, the robot must move right to reach (2, n).

3. **Critical Condition**:
   - The robot can only move down from the first row to the second row if the arrow in the first row points right and the arrow in the corresponding cell in the second row points left.
   - The robot must then move right in the second row to reach (2, n).

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two rows of arrows.
   - The program checks if the arrow in the second row at the second-to-last column (i.e., `b[n - 2]`) is pointing left (`<`).
   - If `b[n - 2]` is `<`, it prints "No".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

5. **Logical Flaw**:
   - The program only checks the arrow in the second row at the second-to-last column (`b[n - 2]`).
   - This is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach (2, n). The robot might be able to reach (2, n) through other paths, and the condition `b[n - 2] == '<'` does not cover all possible scenarios.

6. **Correct Condition**:
   - The robot can reach (2, n) if there is a way to move from (1, 1) to (2, n) by following the rules.
   - Specifically, the robot can reach (2, n) if there is a sequence of moves that allows it to move to the second row and then move right to the last column.
   - The program should check if there is any way to move from (1, 1) to (2, n) considering all possible moves and arrow directions.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it only checks a single condition that is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach (2, n).

**Correctness: False**
