Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take a binary string `s` as input, where 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `s` consists only of '0's and '1's. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of the lengths of strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
    zeroes = s.count(0)
    cnt = [0, 0]
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        cnt[c] += 1
        if c == 0:
            ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
        else:
            ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of zeros in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the number of ones in `s`, `ans` is the total number of pairs (i, j) such that `s[i] == 0` and `s[j] == 1` and `i < j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in `s`, `cnt` is [number of 0s in `s`, number of 1s in `s`], and `ans` is the sum of the number of 0s in `s` for which there is at least one 1 before them, plus the sum of the number of 1s in `s` multiplied by the total number of 0s in `s` minus the number of 0s that have already been counted before each 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in `s`, `cnt` is [number of zeros in `s`, number of ones in `s`], and `ans` is the total number of pairs `(i, j)` where `s[i]` is 0 and `s[j]` is 1, and `i < j`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
