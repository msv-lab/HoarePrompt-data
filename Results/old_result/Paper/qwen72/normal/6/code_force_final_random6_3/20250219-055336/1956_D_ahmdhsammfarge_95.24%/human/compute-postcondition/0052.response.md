Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 < n <= 18`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` from index 0 to 1 and from index 6 to `n-1` plus 16, `r` is 2, `l` is 5, and `over_sum` remains unchanged.**

The code snippet `r, l = [i, j]` assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `r` and `l` respectively. Since `i` is 2 and `j` is 5, `r` is now 2 and `l` is now 5. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
