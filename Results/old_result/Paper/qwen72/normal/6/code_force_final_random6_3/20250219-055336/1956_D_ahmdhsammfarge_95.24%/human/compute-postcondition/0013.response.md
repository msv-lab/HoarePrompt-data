Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers of length n, where 3 <= n <= 18, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `sm` is equal to the sum of all elements in `lst` except `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` plus 9, `r` is 0, and `l` is 1. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `over_sum` is equal to `sm` and `l` is 2. Otherwise, `over_sum` remains unchanged and `l` is 1.***
