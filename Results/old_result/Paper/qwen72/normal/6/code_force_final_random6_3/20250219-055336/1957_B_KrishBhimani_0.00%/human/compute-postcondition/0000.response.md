The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the range is determined by the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the range must be at least 1. Therefore, the input must be a positive integer. The parameters `n` and `k` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
