To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `k` and `len(nums) >= 2`.

1. **`k`**: The loop can execute as long as `k` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than 0, so `k` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

2. **`len(nums) >= 2`**: The loop can execute as long as the length of `nums` is at least 2. At the end of the last iteration, `len(nums)` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again, `len(nums)` must be at least 2.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15.
- `nums` is a deque containing the elements of the original list `nums` minus the first, last, and the two most recently removed elements.
- `a` is the value of the first element removed from the deque.
- `b` is the value of the last element removed from the deque.
- `k` is greater than 0.
- `len(nums)` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `x` is the minimum value between `a` and `b`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state so that:
- `k` remains greater than 0.
- `len(nums)` is at least 2.

Since `k` is already greater than 0, it does not need to be adjusted. However, `len(nums)` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue. Therefore, we need to ensure that `len(nums)` is at least 2.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. `nums` is a deque containing the elements of the original list `nums` minus the first, last, and the two most recently removed elements, and `len(nums)` must be at least 2. `a` is the value of the first element removed from the deque, and `b` is the value of the last element removed from the deque. `k` is greater than 0. `x` is the minimum value between `a` and `b`.**
