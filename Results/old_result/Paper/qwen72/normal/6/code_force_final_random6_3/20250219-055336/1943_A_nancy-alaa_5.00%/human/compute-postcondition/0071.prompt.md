Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and equal to `t`, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is False, `i` is the index of the first integer in `arr` that either does not appear in `mpp` or appears exactly once and `first` is True, or `n` if the loop completes without breaking, the loop will execute again if the integer input provided by `int(input())` is greater than the current iteration count.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if i not in mpp.keys():
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1:
        first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `first` is True. If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without modifying `i`, `n`, or `mpp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `first` is True, and `mpp` remains unchanged. If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i] == 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `first` is True, and `mpp` remains unchanged. If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i]` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
