Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the value `xor` if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, otherwise `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is the result of `xor` XOR `i`, `thing1` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `xor` is updated by performing an XOR operation with `i`.
- The value of `i` remains the third element in `cur_arr`.
- The value of `bit` remains an integer between 0 and 29, inclusive, and is not equal to -1.
- The value of `new_arr` depends on the bit at position `bit` in the updated `xor`. If the bit at position `bit` in the updated `xor` is 0, `new_arr` contains the updated `xor`. Otherwise, `new_arr` remains an empty list.
- The value of `thing1` remains 0.
