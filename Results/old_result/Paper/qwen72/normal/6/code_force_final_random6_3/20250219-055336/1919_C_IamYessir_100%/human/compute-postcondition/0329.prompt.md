Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `i` is -1, `s` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` and `b` are lists, `i`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers. `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. If `b` is not an empty list, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `x` > `y`, and `lit[i]` is greater than or equal to `x` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element, and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `b` now contains `lit[i]` as its last element, and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x` â‰¤ `y`, and `x` is equal to `y`, the list `a` now includes the integer `lit[i]` as its last element. If `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `a` now contains `lit[i]` as its last element. If `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x`, `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element. In all other cases, `x` and `y` retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is `i + 1`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1, `y` retains its original value or is set to `float('inf')` if `len(b) == 0`, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is `float('inf')` if `len(a) == 0`, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`. If `x > y` and `y >= lit[i]`, the value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `b`. If `x > y` and `y < lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, the value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `b`. If `x > y` and `y < lit[i]` and `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, the value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `a`. If `x <= y` and `x == y`, the value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `a`. If `x <= y` and `x < y` and `lit[i] <= y`, the value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `a`. If `x <= y` and `x < y` and `lit[i] > y`, the value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is incremented by 1, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1, `y` is `float('inf')` if `len(b) == 0` or the last element of `b` otherwise, `x` retains its original value or is set to `float('inf')` if `len(a) == 0`, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`. If `x > y` and `y >= lit[i]`, the value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `b`. If `x > y` and `y < lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, the value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `b`. If `x > y` and `y < lit[i]` and `lit[i] <= x` and `lit[i] > y`, the value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `a`. If `x > y` and `y < lit[i]` and `lit[i] <= x` and `lit[i] <= y`, the value `lit[i]` is not appended to either list. If `x <= y` and `x == y`, the value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `a`. If `x <= y` and `x < y` and `lit[i] <= y`, the value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `a`. If `x <= y` and `x < y` and `lit[i] > y` and `lit[i] > x`, the value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `b`. If `x <= y` and `x < y` and `lit[i] > y` and `lit[i] <= x`, the value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `a`. If none of the above conditions are met, the value of `lit[i]` and the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
