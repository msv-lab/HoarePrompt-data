Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is `i + 1`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1, `y` retains its original value or is set to `float('inf')` if `len(b) == 0`, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`, `x` is `float('inf')` if `len(a) == 0`, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, `a` now contains the element `lit[i]` at the end of the list.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(lit[i])` adds the element `lit[i]` to the end of the list `a`.
- The value of `i` is `i + 1` as per the initial state.
- The values of `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The value of `y` is either retained as its original value or set to `float('inf')` if `len(b) == 0`, or set to the last element of `b` if `len(b) > 0`.
- The value of `x` is either `float('inf')` if `len(a) == 0` (after the append operation, this condition will only be true if `a` was initially empty), or set to the last element of `a` (which is now `lit[i]`).
- The list `a` now includes the element `lit[i]` at the end.
