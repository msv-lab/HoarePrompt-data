Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n - 3`, and `max` is the maximum of the middle elements of all possible sorted sublists of length 3 from the list `a` for each iteration.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t` is 0**: The loop has completed all `t` iterations, so `t` is now 0.
- **`_` is `t - 1`**: The loop variable `_` has incremented to `t - 1`, which is the last iteration index.
- **`n` is an input integer greater than 2**: For each iteration, `n` is an input integer provided by the user, and it must be greater than 2 to enter the inner loop.
- **`a` is a list of integers input by the user**: For each iteration, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- **`i` is `n - 3`**: The inner loop variable `i` has incremented to `n - 3`, which is the last index for which a sublist of length 3 can be formed.
- **`max` is the maximum of the middle elements of all possible sorted sublists of length 3 from the list `a` for each iteration**: For each iteration of the outer loop, `max` is updated to the maximum value among the middle elements of all sorted sublists of length 3 from the list `a`. This value is printed at the end of each iteration.
