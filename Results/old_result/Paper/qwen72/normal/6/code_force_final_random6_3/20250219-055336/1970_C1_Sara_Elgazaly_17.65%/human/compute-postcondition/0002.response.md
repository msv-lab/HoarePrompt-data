The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x - 1` is greater than 0, which means `x` must be greater than 1. Since `x` is already stated to be an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, it meets the condition for the loop to execute. The variable `y` and the defaultdict `lst` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `_` is 0**
