### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a line of slimes, each with a size.
   - Each second, a slime can eat one of its neighbors if it is strictly larger.
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten, or -1 if it is impossible.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**:
     - This function is used to find the index of the first element in a sorted list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
     - It returns -1 if `x` is less than 0.
     - If `x` is found in `a`, it returns the index of `x` plus 1.
     - If `x` is not found, it returns the index `inx` where `a[inx]` is the smallest element greater than `x`.

   - **func_2**:
     - This function calculates the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten from the left.
     - It maintains a list `left` which keeps the cumulative sum of sizes from the start to the current index.
     - It also maintains a list `last` which keeps track of the last occurrence of the previous slime's size.
     - For each slime, if it is smaller than its left neighbor, it can be eaten in 1 second.
     - Otherwise, it calculates a value `x` which is the cumulative sum of sizes up to the current slime minus the current slime's size minus 1.
     - It then uses `func_1` to find the index `inx` in the cumulative sum list where the sum is greater than or equal to `x`.
     - If the last occurrence of the previous slime's size is less than `inx`, it updates `inx` to the last occurrence.
     - If `inx` is valid (not -1), it sets `ans[i]` to `i + 1 - inx`.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The main loop iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2` twice: once for the original list and once for the reversed list.
   - It then combines the results from both calls to get the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.
   - If a slime can be eaten from either direction, it takes the minimum of the two values.
   - If a slime cannot be eaten from either direction, it remains -1.

4. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where a slime can be eaten by its left neighbor in 1 second.
   - It also correctly handles the case where a slime can be eaten by a neighbor that is not immediately adjacent by using the cumulative sum and the last occurrence of the previous slime's size.
   - The combination of results from both directions ensures that the minimum number of seconds is taken into account.
   - The use of `func_1` to find the appropriate index in the cumulative sum list is efficient and correct.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all the edge cases and uses efficient data structures and algorithms to find the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.

**Correctness: True**
