The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop executes, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `i` must start at 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- For each test case, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.

However, these variables (`t`, `a`, `b`) are not directly involved in the loop head. The loop head depends on the user input, which is converted to an integer and used as the range for the loop.

To ensure the loop executes:
- The user input must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
- The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
