Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains one element fewer than before.** 

The values of `tree`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged. The values of `v` and `postorder` are updated to the first and second elements, respectively, that were popped from `stack`. The `stack` now has one fewer element than it did initially.
