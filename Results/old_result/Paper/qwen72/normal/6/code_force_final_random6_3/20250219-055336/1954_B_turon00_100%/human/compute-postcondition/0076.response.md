Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`.
- If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and 0, which is 0.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `i` remain unchanged.
