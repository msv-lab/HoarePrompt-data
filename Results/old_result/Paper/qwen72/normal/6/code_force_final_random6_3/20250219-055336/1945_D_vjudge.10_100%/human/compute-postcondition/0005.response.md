Output State: **`pergunta` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), `a` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `b` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9), `n` is an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `m` is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `x` is `min(a[i], b[i])`, `i` is `n - 1`. If `i` is less than `m`, `pergunta` is the minimum of the original `pergunta` and `a[i]`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `x += min(a[i], b[i])` increments the value of `x` by the minimum of the elements at index `i` in lists `a` and `b`. The value of `i` is `n - 1`, and the other variables remain unchanged. If `i` is less than `m`, the value of `pergunta` is updated to the minimum of its original value and `a[i]`.
