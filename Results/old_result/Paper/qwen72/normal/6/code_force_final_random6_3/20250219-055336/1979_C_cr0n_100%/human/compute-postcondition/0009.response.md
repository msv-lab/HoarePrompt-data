Output State: **`N` is an input integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 50), `vals` is a list of N integers where each integer `k_i` satisfies (2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20), `den` is the result of applying `func_1` to the initial `den` and all elements in `vals` sequentially, and `vals` has exactly N elements.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `N` remains the same input integer within the range of 1 to 50. The list `vals` still contains the same N integers, each within the range of 2 to 20. The variable `den` has been updated to the final result of applying the function `func_1` to the initial value of `den` (which was the first element of `vals`) and each subsequent element of `vals` in order. The list `vals` has exactly N elements, as it did at the start.
