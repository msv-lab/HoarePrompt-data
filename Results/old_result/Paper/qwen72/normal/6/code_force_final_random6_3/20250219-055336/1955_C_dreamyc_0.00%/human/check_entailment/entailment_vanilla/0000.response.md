### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It also reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Deque Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a deque `nums` to efficiently handle the removal of elements from both ends of the list.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The program enters a loop that continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and at least two ships remain (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - In each iteration, it removes the first and last ships from the deque (`a` and `b`).
   - It calculates the minimum durability between the two ships (`x`).
   - If the number of remaining attacks (`k`) is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, it reduces the durability of both ships by `x` and decreases `k` by `2 * x`.
   - If the number of remaining attacks is less than `2 * x`, it breaks out of the loop to handle the remaining attacks separately.

4. **Handling Remaining Ships:**
   - If there are still attacks left (`k > 0`) and only one ship remains (`len(nums) == 1`), it checks if the remaining attacks are enough to sink the last ship.
   - If so, it increments the answer by 1 and returns it.
   - If not, it simply returns the current count of sunk ships.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where there are no ships left to attack.
   - It also handles the case where the number of attacks is less than the durability of the remaining ships.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine how many ships are sunk by the Kraken based on the given problem description. It efficiently uses a deque to manage the ships and correctly handles the attacks in the specified order.

### Correctness:
**True**
