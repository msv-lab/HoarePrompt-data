You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

- Program:

        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        k = abs(n - m)

            print(k)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            print(k - q)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x != y.

    #State: `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x != y, `i` is the number of iterations specified by the user input, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, the program retains the initial state of the variables. Otherwise, if `n` is 0 and `m` is even or odd, the program retains the initial state of the variables. If neither of these conditions is met, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the binary representation of `k`, and `q` is 2 raised to the power of (p - 1).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `i` from user input, which specifies the number of iterations to perform. For each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from user input, calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`, and prints a value based on the following conditions: If `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`. If `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, it prints 1. If `n` is 0 and `m` is even, it prints 2. Otherwise, it calculates the highest power of 2 less than `k` and prints the difference between `k` and that power of 2. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given two sequences \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) defined as:
     - \( a_n = n \oplus x \)
     - \( b_n = n \oplus y \)
   - The task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment of these sequences.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The sequences \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) are essentially shifted versions of each other by the value \( x \oplus y \). This is because:
     - \( a_n = n \oplus x \)
     - \( b_n = n \oplus y \)
     - Therefore, \( a_n \oplus b_n = (n \oplus x) \oplus (n \oplus y) = x \oplus y \)
   - The length of the longest common subsegment is determined by the number of consecutive values where \( x \oplus y \) does not change the relative order of the sequence elements.

3. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \) (which are \( x \) and \( y \) in the problem statement).
   - It calculates \( k = |n - m| \), which is the absolute difference between \( x \) and \( y \).
   - The program then checks if \( k \) is a power of 2 using the condition \( k \& (k - 1) == 0 \). If \( k \) is a power of 2, it prints \( k \).
   - If \( n == 0 \) and \( m \) is odd, it prints 1.
   - If \( n == 0 \) and \( m \) is even, it prints 2.
   - Otherwise, it converts \( k \) to its binary representation, finds the length of the binary string, and calculates \( 2^{(p - 1)} \), where \( p \) is the length of the binary string. It then prints \( k - 2^{(p - 1)} \).

4. **Correctness of the Conditions**:
   - **Power of 2 Check**: If \( k \) is a power of 2, the sequences \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) will have a common subsegment of length \( k \). This is because the XOR of \( k \) with any number \( n \) will cycle through a pattern of length \( k \). Hence, this condition is correct.
   - **Special Case \( n == 0 \) and \( m \) is odd**: If \( x = 0 \) and \( y \) is odd, the sequences \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) will have a common subsegment of length 1. This is because \( 0 \oplus 0 = 0 \) and \( 0 \oplus y \) (where \( y \) is odd) will not match any other \( 0 \oplus y \) in the sequence. Hence, this condition is correct.
   - **Special Case \( n == 0 \) and \( m \) is even**: If \( x = 0 \) and \( y \) is even, the sequences \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) will have a common subsegment of length 2. This is because \( 0 \oplus 0 = 0 \) and \( 0 \oplus y \) (where \( y \) is even) will match \( 1 \oplus y \) (where \( y \) is even). Hence, this condition is correct.
   - **General Case**: For other values of \( k \), the program calculates the length of the longest common subsegment by finding the highest power of 2 less than \( k \) and subtracting it from \( k \). This is based on the observation that the length of the common subsegment is related to the binary representation of \( k \). Specifically, the length of the common subsegment is \( k - 2^{(p - 1)} \), where \( p \) is the number of bits in \( k \). This is correct because the sequences will have a common subsegment of length \( 2^{(p - 1)} \) and the remaining length will be \( k - 2^{(p - 1)} \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly handles all the cases and calculates the length of the longest common subsegment as per the problem description.
