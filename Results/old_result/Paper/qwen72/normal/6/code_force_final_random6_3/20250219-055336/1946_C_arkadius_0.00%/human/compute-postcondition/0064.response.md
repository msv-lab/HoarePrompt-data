The only object in the loop head is `stack`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `stack` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `stack` now contains one element fewer than before. For the loop to execute one more time, `stack` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains one element fewer than before, and `stack` must still contain at least one element**
