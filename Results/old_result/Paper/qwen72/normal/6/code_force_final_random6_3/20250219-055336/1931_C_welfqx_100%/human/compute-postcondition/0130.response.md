Output State: **`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of `num` that are equal, up to `n - 1`. If all elements in `onum` are equal, `ck` is `n - 1`. If `symb1` and `symb2` are equal, `cn` is increased by `ck`, `r` is `t - 1`, `t` must be greater than `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `num`.
- The values of `ii`, `ck`, `cn`, `r`, `t`, `n`, and `f` remain unchanged.
- The initial state of `num` being undefined is now updated to a list of integers provided by the user.
