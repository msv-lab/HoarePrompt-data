Output State: **`input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `index` is 5 + `n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[5:5 + n]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[5 + n:5 + 2*n]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` creates a new list `a` by mapping the `int` function to a slice of `data` starting from `index` and ending at `index + n`.
- `index` is defined as `5 + n`, so the slice `data[index:index + n]` corresponds to `data[5 + n:5 + 2*n]`.
- `a` is now a list of integers from the elements in `data` starting from the position `5 + n` and ending at `5 + 2*n`.
- All other variables (`input`, `data`, `index`, `t`, `results`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`) remain unchanged.
