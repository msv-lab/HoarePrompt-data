Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string that must have at least two elements, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in `s`, and `c` is the second element of `s`. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [2, 0] and `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is [0, 2] and `ans` is `zeroes + 1`. If `c` is not 0, `cnt` is [0, 2] and `ans` is `2 * zeroes`.***
