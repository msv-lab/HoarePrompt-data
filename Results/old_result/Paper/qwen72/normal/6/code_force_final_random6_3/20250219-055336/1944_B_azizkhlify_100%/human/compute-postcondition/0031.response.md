Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
2. `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor\).
3. `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 1.
4. `l` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[0] - 1` set to 0 if `l[a[0] - 1]` was originally 2, otherwise `l` remains unchanged.
5. `r` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range `n` to `2n-1`.
6. `re` is 0.
7. `ul` is 2 if `l[a[0] - 1]` was originally 2, otherwise `ul` remains 0.
8. `ur` is 0.
9. `res` is an empty list.
10. `i` is 1.
11. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking the loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is set to 1.
2. **List `a`**: The list `a` is a list of integers input by the user. The exact values of `a` are not provided, but we know that `a[0]` and `a[1]` are the first and second elements of this list, respectively.
3. **Print Statement**: The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Output Calculation:
- Since `i` is 1, the `print` statement will print `a[1]` twice, followed by a space.
- The exact value of `a[1]` is not provided, but it is an integer from the user input.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[1] a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list `a`)**
