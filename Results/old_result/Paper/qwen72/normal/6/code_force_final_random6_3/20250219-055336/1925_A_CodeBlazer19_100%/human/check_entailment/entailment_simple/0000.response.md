### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The task is to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The goal is to find the smallest possible length of `s` that satisfies this condition.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It then prints the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **String Construction:**
     - The string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]` is a substring of the first `k` letters of the alphabet.
     - Multiplying this string by `n` results in a string that repeats the first `k` letters `n` times.
   - **Subsequence Property:**
     - For `n = 1`, the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]` will contain all possible single-character strings of length 1 using the first `k` letters.
     - For `n > 1`, the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n` will contain all possible strings of length `n` as subsequences because each character in the first `k` letters will appear `n` times in the repeated string.
   - **Smallest Length:**
     - The length of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n` is `k * n`.
     - This length is not necessarily the smallest possible length that satisfies the condition. For example, for `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the string `baab` is shorter than `aabb` and still contains all possible subsequences of length 2 using the first 2 letters.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - **Test Case 1: `n = 1, k = 2`**
     - The program outputs `ab`.
     - This is correct because it contains all possible strings of length 1 using the first 2 letters (`a` and `b`).
   - **Test Case 2: `n = 2, k = 1`**
     - The program outputs `aa`.
     - This is correct because it contains the only possible string of length 2 using the first 1 letter (`a`).
   - **Test Case 3: `n = 2, k = 2`**
     - The program outputs `aabb`.
     - While `aabb` does contain all possible strings of length 2 using the first 2 letters (`aa`, `ab`, `ba`, `bb`), the string `baab` is shorter and also correct.
   - **Test Case 4: `n = 2, k = 3`**
     - The program outputs `aabbcc`.
     - While `aabbcc` does contain all possible strings of length 2 using the first 3 letters (`aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, `cc`), the string `abcbac` is shorter and also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program does not always produce the smallest possible string that satisfies the condition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
