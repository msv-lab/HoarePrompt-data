Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is `n - 1`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is the input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by `n`. `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`. `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`. The lists `a` and `b` contain elements from `lit` based on the conditions specified in the loop.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the input integer.
- After all iterations, the variable `i` will be `n - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n - 1`.
- The variable `_` will be incremented by `n` because it is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- The lists `a` and `b` will contain elements from the input list `lit` based on the conditions specified in the loop:
  - If `a` is empty, `x` is set to infinity.
  - If `b` is empty, `y` is set to infinity.
  - If `x` (the last element of `a`) is greater than `y` (the last element of `b`), the element `lit[i]` is appended to `b` if `lit[i]` is greater than or equal to `y`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x` and less than `y`, it is appended to `b`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x` and greater than `y`, it is appended to `a`.
  - If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, and `x` is equal to `y`, the element `lit[i]` is appended to `a`.
  - If `x` is less than `y`, and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, it is appended to `a`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, it is appended to `b`.
- The variables `s` and `cp` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.
