Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined without any parameters, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The function should accept the integer `X` for each test case.
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case, but `func_1` does not take any arguments, which means it cannot process the input `X` correctly.

2. **Processing the Input**:
   - The function `func_1` reads an integer `x` from the user input and subtracts 1 from it. This is a step to handle the fact that an empty subsequence is also considered increasing.
   - The function then attempts to decompose `x` into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1. This is a valid approach because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as a sum of such terms.

3. **Generating the Array**:
   - The function maintains a list `subseq_lens` to store the lengths of the sub-sequences.
   - It finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x + 1` and subtracts the corresponding value from `x`.
   - The maximum length `mx` is updated to keep track of the largest sub-sequence length.
   - After the loop, `x` should be 0, and `subseq_lens` should contain the lengths of the sub-sequences.

4. **Constructing the Answer**:
   - The function constructs the array `ansv` by first including integers from 0 to `mx-1`.
   - It then appends the elements from `subseq_lens` (excluding the first element) to `ansv`.
   - The length of `ansv` is printed, followed by the elements of `ansv`.

5. **Output and Constraints**:
   - The output format is correct: the length of the array followed by the elements of the array.
   - The elements of the array are within the allowed range `[-10^9, 10^9]`.

6. **Edge Cases and Correctness**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `x` is 0 after the loop, indicating that the required number of increasing subsequences has been achieved.
   - However, the function does not handle the case where it is impossible to find the required array, which should return `-1`.

Given the above points, the program has a few issues:
- The function `func_1` should accept `X` as a parameter.
- The function should handle the case where it is impossible to find the required array and return `-1`.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
