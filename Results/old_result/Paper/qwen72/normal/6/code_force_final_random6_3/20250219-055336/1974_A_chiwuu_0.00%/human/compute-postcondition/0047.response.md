Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` updates the value of `t1` based on the current values of `t` and `b`.
- The initial state specifies that `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, which is exactly what the code snippet does.
- Therefore, the value of `t1` is now `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- The values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The conditions regarding `t` and `t2` are not affected by this code snippet, so they remain as described in the initial state.
