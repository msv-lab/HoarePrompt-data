Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are the new input strings, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 1, and `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`. If `hd` > 0, `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1` if `s1[0]` is '1' and `s2[0]` is '0' and `a1 - a2` > 0, otherwise `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1` if `s1[0]` is '1' and `s2[0]` is '0' and `a1 - a2` ≤ 0, or `hd` remains `a1 - a2` if `s1[0]` is not '1' or `s2[0]` is not '0'. If `hd` ≤ 0, `hd` remains `a1 - a2` regardless of the values of `s1[0]` and `s2[0]`. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop.***
