pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 \le pergunta \le 10^4), a is a list of n integers (1 \le a_i \le 10^9), b is a list of n integers (1 \le b_i \le 10^9), n is an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill (1 \le n \le 200,000), and m is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 \le m \le n). The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
