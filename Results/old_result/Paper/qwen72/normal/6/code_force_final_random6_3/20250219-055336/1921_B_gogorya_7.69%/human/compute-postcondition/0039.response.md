The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is set to `n-1`, but for the loop to execute, `i` should start from 0. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to 0, and `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 0, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`, `hd` is `a1 - a2`**
