Output State: **`pergunta` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), `a` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `b` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9), `n` is an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `m` is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `x` is `min(a[i], b[i]) + min(a[i], b[i])`, `i` is `n - 2`. If `i` is less than `m`, `pergunta` is the minimum of the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`. Otherwise, `pergunta` retains its original value.**
