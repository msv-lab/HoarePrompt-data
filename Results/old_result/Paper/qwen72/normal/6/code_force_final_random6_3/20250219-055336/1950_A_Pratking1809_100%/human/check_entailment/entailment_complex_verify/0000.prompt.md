You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three digits a, b, and c, where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The number of test cases, t, is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `q` is greater than 0, `i` is `q-1`, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input integers for the last iteration. If `a < b < c`, the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy `a < b < c`. If `a < b > c`, the condition `a < b` and `b > c` holds. Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` holds.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `q` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= q <= 1000. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). It then checks the relationship between these three integers and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state is that `q` test cases have been processed, with the appropriate output printed for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads three digits and checks if they form a stair, a peak, or neither, and prints the appropriate output. The conditions `a < b < c` for a stair and `a < b > c` for a peak are correctly implemented, and the program outputs "NONE" for all other cases, which aligns with the problem description. No edge cases or missing logic have been identified that would cause the program to fail.
