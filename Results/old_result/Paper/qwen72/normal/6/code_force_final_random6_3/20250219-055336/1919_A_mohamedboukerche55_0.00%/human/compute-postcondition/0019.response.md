Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a series of test cases from user input. Each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, the function checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If the sum is even, it prints 'bob  '; otherwise, it prints 'alice'. After processing all test cases, the function retains the values of `a` and `b` from the last test case, but does not return any value. **
