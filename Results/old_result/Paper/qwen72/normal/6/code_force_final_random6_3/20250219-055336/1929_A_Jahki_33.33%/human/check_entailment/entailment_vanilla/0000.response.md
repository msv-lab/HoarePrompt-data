### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array elements `a` from the input.
   - It converts the input string into a list of integers using a list comprehension and the `isdigit()` method to filter out non-digit characters.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It iterates through the array and increments `order` if the current element is not greater than or equal to the previous element.
   - If `order` is 0, it means the array is sorted, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - If the array is already sorted (as determined by `func_1`), the program prints 0 because the beauty of a sorted array is 0.
   - If the array is not sorted, the program sorts the array `a` and calculates the beauty of the sorted array.
   - The beauty is calculated by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

### Analysis of the Solution:

- **Objective:**
  - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in non-decreasing order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array will be minimized, and the sum of these minimized differences will be maximized.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted. If it is, the beauty is 0, and the program prints 0.
  - However, this check is unnecessary because sorting the array will always yield the maximum beauty, regardless of whether the array was initially sorted or not.

- **Beauty Calculation:**
  - The program correctly sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
  - This approach is correct and will always yield the maximum possible beauty.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct in terms of logic and implementation. However, the `func_1` function is redundant and can be removed to simplify the code. The main logic of sorting the array and calculating the beauty is correct and will produce the desired output for all valid inputs.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
