Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer and `n >= 5`, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1`, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`, and so on until `a[l - 1]` must be equal to `a[l]`, `st` is 1, `end` is 0, `ans` is not yet determined**

The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so `l` is now 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
