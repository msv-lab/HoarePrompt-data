The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limit `10`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `10`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to `1`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except `values[0]` which is 0, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 0, `i` is 1, `sum_values[0]` is 0**
