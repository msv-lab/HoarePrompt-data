Precondition: **n is a positive integer such that 1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should take two parameters, `n` and `k`, to match the problem requirements. Here is the corrected function definition:

```
def func_1(n, k):
```

Precondition: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 \leq k \leq 10^9.**
