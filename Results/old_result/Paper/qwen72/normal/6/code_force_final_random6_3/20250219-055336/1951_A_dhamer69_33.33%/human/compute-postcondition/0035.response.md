Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, and `count_1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`. If `n` == 2, the program behaves as described in the if part. If `n` is not 2, and either `count_1` is odd or `s.count('11')` is equal to 1, the program also behaves as described in the if part. Otherwise, the program behaves as described in the else part. In all cases, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `count_1` remain unchanged.**
