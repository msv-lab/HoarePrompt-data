Postcondition: ***`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 0, and `c` is 0 or 1. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is set to `l[0]` and `b` remains `float('inf')`. If `l[0]` is greater than `a` but less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is set to `l[0]` and `a` remains `float('inf')`. If `l[0]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is set to `l[0]` and `b` remains `float('inf')`, and `c` is set to 1. In all cases, if `a` > `b`, then `a` is equal to `b` and `b` is equal to `a`.***
