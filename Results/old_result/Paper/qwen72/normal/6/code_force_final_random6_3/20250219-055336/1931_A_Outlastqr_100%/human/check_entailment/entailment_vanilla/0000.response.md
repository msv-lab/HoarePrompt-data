### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the encoded sum of the positions of the three-letter word.

2. **Alphabet Initialization:**
   - The program initializes the alphabet using `string.ascii_lowercase`, which is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.

3. **Word Construction:**
   - The program constructs the lexicographically smallest word based on the value of `n`:
     - **Case 1: `n > 52`**
       - If `n` is greater than 52, the program constructs the word by adding the letter corresponding to `n - 53` to the beginning, followed by 'zz'.
       - This is correct because the maximum sum of the positions of a three-letter word is 78 (26 + 26 + 26), and the smallest word that can have a sum greater than 52 is 'azz' (1 + 26 + 26 = 53).
     - **Case 2: `n > 27`**
       - If `n` is greater than 27 but less than or equal to 52, the program constructs the word by adding 'a' to the beginning, the letter corresponding to `n - 28` to the middle, and 'z' to the end.
       - This is correct because the smallest word that can have a sum greater than 27 is 'aaz' (1 + 1 + 26 = 28).
     - **Case 3: `n == 27`**
       - If `n` is exactly 27, the program constructs the word 'aay'.
       - This is correct because 'aay' (1 + 1 + 25 = 27) is the lexicographically smallest word with a sum of 27.
     - **Case 4: `n <= 27`**
       - If `n` is less than or equal to 27, the program constructs the word by adding 'aa' to the beginning and the letter corresponding to `n - 3` to the end.
       - This is correct because the smallest word with a sum of `n` can be constructed by using 'aa' and the appropriate letter to make the sum `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed word for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the cases and constructs the lexicographically smallest three-letter word for each given encoded sum `n`. The logic and conditions used are accurate and cover all possible scenarios within the given constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
