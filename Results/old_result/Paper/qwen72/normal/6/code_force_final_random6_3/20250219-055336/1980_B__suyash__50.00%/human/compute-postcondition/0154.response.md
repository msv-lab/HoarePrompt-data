Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `l` has at least one element, and `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[0]]`. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `fav` is equal to `l[0]`, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of the value of `k`.***
