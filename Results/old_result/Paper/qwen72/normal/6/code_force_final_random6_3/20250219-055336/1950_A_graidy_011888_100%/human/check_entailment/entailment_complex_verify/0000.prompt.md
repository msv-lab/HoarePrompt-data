You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are digits (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits (integers) provided by the user input, `n` is an input integer, and `i` is `n-1`. For each iteration from 0 to `n-1`, if `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is less than `c`, and 'STAIR' is printed. If `a < b and b > c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is greater than `c`, and 'PEAK' is printed. If none of these conditions hold, then `a`, `b`, and `c` do not satisfy `a < b < c` or `a < b and b > c`, and 'NONE' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. It then checks the relationship between these integers and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b` and `b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all `n` test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that `n` test cases have been processed, and the appropriate output ('STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE') has been printed for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by checking the conditions as specified in the problem description. The conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`) are correctly implemented, and the program outputs "NONE" for all other cases. No edge cases or missing logic are apparent, and the program should work correctly for all valid inputs within the specified range.
