Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings from the new input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is the sum of the values of \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for each `i` from 1 to `b` where \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0\), and an additional 1 is added to `suma` for each `i` where \((a - i \times (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0\) and \(i \times (i - 1) % i^2 == 0\)**

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `m`, `T`, and `t` remain unchanged.
- The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integer values of the first and second strings in the `info` list, respectively.
- The condition that `b` must be greater than or equal to 1 is still valid.
- The calculation for `suma` remains the same, using the new values of `a` and `b`.
