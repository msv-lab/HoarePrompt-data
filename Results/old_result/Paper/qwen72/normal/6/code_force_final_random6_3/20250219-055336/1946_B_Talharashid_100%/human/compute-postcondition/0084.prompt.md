Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function definition. Based on the problem description, the function should take three parameters: a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`, and an integer `k` representing the number of operations. The list `a` contains integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9, and `n` and `k` are within the range 1 to 2 \cdot 10^5. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 \le t \le 10^4).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c = 0
    maxi = 0
    for ele in l:
        if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
            maxi = max(c, maxi)
            c = 0
        else:
            c += ele
            maxi = max(c, maxi)
    maxi = max(c, maxi)
    print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `c` is the sum of the non-negative subsequence of `l` that has the highest sum, and `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `c` is the sum of the non-negative elements of `l` from the last negative element (or from the start if no negative element is encountered) to the end of the list, and `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `c` is the sum of the non-negative integers in the list `l` up to the last non-negative integer before a negative integer that resets `c` to 0, `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` observed during the loop execution, updated to be the maximum of the current `c` and the previous `maxi`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
