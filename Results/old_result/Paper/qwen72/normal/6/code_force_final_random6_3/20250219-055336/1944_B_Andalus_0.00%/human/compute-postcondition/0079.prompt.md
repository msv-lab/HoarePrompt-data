Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of input integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `i` is `n - 1`, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that are equal to their preceding element, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and also not equal to their following element, provided `i` is less than `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element, `sz` is the smallest even number such that `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` and `sz` is incremented by 2 for each element in `ldb` processed, `elem` is the last element in `ldb` that was processed, and the current value of `k - sz` is less than 2.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sng` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `sng`. If the size of `sng` (`sz`) is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `sz` is now `sz + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sng` must contain at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in `sng`, `sz` is increased by 1, if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sng` must contain at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `sng`, `sz` is increased by 1. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
