Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, sorted in descending order.**

The `nums` list is already sorted in descending order in the initial state, and the `sort(reverse=True)` method does not change its order, so the list remains sorted in descending order. The values of `t`, `_`, and `n` are not affected by the code snippet.
