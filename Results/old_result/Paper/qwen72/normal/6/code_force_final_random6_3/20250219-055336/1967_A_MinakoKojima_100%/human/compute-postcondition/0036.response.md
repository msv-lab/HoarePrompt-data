Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `res` is `n - 3`. `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated by adding `k // (i + 1)`.
- Since `k` is 0, `k // (i + 1)` evaluates to `0 // 2`, which is 0.
- Therefore, `ans` remains 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
