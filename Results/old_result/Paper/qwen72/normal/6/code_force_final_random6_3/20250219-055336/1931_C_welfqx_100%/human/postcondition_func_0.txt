The function `func` reads input values for `t` test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `num`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from `num` to make it a palindrome. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case.
