Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is undefined, `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[i]` is `n`, `ind` is equal to `n`**

Explanation: The code `p[i] = ind` assigns the value of `ind` (which is equal to `n`) to the element at index `i` in the list `p`. Since `i` is undefined, the exact index that is updated is unknown, but we know that the list `p` will have a value of `n` at the index `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
