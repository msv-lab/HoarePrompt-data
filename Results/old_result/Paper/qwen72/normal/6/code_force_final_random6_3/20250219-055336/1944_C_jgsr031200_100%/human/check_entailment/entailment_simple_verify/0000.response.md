### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. The function `func_1` simply checks the frequency of elements in the array `arr` and prints the first index where the frequency is less than 2 or 0. This approach is flawed because it does not consider the dynamic nature of the game where Alice and Bob take turns and make strategic choices to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c` respectively.

Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Frequency Check:**
   - The program initializes a frequency list `freq` to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the range from 0 to `n` and checks the frequency of each integer.
   - If an integer has a frequency of 0, it prints that integer and breaks the loop.
   - If an integer has a frequency of 1, it increments a counter `cou`.
   - If `cou` reaches 2, it prints the current integer and breaks the loop.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice and Bob play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c` respectively.
   - The optimal strategy involves considering the sequence of moves and the resulting state of the array `c` after each move.
   - The program does not simulate the game or consider the sequence of moves, which is crucial for determining the MEX.

3. **Counterexample:**
   - The provided counterexample is valid:
     - Input: `1 5 0 1 2 3 4`
     - Expected Output: `1`
     - Actual Output: `5`
   - The program outputs 5 because it finds that all integers from 0 to 4 are present in `arr` and none have a frequency of 0. It then prints 5, which is incorrect.
   - The optimal play, as described, results in `c = [0, 2, 4]` and the MEX of `c` is 1.

### Final Evaluation:
The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game and fails to produce the correct MEX for the given inputs. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
