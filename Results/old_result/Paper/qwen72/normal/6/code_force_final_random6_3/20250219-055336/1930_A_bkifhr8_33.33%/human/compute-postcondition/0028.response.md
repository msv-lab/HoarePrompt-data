Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `ans_f` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` using spaces as the delimiter, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The values of `t`, `i`, `ans_f`, `n`, `l`, and `lst` remain unchanged, but the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in.
