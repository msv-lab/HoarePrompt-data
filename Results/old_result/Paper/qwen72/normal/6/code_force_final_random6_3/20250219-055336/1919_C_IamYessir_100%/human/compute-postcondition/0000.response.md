The only variables in the loop head are `_` and the result of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If this value is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts does not provide any information about the input value, so we need to ensure that the input value is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
