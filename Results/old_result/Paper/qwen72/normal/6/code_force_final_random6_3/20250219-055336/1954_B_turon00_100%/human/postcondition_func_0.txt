The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates the minimum length of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to the first element of `a`. If `n` is 1 or all elements in `a` are the same, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length found. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the input variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are no longer needed, and the state of the program is reset for the next test case, if any.
