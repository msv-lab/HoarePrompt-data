Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist), `ldb` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are equal to their immediate preceding elements, `sz`, `T`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged. If `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[1]`, `rdb` now contains the value of `rgt[2]`. Additionally, if `rgt[1]` is equal to `rgt[0]`, `rdb` also contains the value of `rgt[1]` (which is equal to `rgt[0]`), otherwise, `rdb` remains unchanged.***
