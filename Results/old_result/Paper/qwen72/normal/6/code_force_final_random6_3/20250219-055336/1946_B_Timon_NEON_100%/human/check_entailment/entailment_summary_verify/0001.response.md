### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, summing its elements, and inserting this sum back into the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(number)`**:
   - This function correctly returns the number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It is a simple and correct implementation for the modulo operation.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(arr)`**:
   - The function `func_2` is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the array `arr`.
   - However, the implementation is flawed:
     - The `new_segment` and `max_segment` lists are not properly initialized. `new_segment` should be initialized as an empty list or with a single element, and `max_segment` should be initialized to handle the maximum sum subarray.
     - The logic for updating `segments_variants` and `max_segment` is incorrect and does not handle all cases. It incorrectly appends segments and does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray.
     - The function does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray. A correct approach to find the maximum sum subarray would be to use Kadane's algorithm, which is not implemented here.
   - Therefore, `func_2` is incorrect and does not serve its intended purpose.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(number, quantity)`**:
   - This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operation.
   - It is supposed to calculate the maximum possible sum after `k` operations, but it is not implemented.
   - The function summary provided is incorrect, as the function does not return a list containing `quantity` elements, each of which is the value of `number`. It simply initializes `answer` to 0 and does nothing else.

5. **Overall Program**:
   - The program lacks a main function or any logic to process the input and output the results.
   - The `func_2` function, which is supposed to find the maximum sum subarray, is incorrect.
   - The `func_3` function, which is supposed to handle the operations, is not implemented.
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum sum subarray and does not handle the operations as required by the problem statement. The functions `func_2` and `func_3` are either flawed or incomplete, and the overall program structure is missing the necessary components to process the input and produce the correct output.

Final: **False**
