Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with any number of elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the cumulative XOR values of the elements in `cur_arr` that had the bit at position `bit` set to 0 at the time of their XOR operation, `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is 0. Additionally, the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0.**
