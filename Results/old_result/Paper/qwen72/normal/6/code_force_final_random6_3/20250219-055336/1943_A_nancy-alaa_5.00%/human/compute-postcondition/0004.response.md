Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and equal to `t`, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is False.**

The variable `first` is now set to `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
