Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x != y, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `k` is not a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2 ** (p - 1).**

Explanation: The value of `q` is calculated as 2 raised to the power of `p - 1`, where `p` is the length of the binary representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
