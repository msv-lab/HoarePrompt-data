The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `int(input())`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `s` is the user input string, `a` is the first integer from the user input string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the user input string `s`**
