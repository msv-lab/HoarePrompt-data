Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. If `mpp[i]` is 1, `first` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `first` remains False and the program continues executing the next statement after the if block.***
