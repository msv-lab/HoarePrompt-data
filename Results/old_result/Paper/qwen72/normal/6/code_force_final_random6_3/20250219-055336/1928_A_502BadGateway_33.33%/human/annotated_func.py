#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
    #The program returns 'yes' if `b` is an even number, otherwise it returns 'no'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `a` and `b` within the range 1 to 10^9. It returns 'yes' if `b` is an even number, and 'no' if `b` is an odd number. The value of `a` is not used in the function and does not affect the return value.
