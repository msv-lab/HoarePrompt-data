The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters within its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function deals with multiple test cases, each defined by three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`. The constraints indicate that `t` is the number of test cases, with each `n`, `a`, and `b` falling within specified ranges. The function is expected to return a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the prompt.

Given the constraints and the typical structure of such problems, the function likely returns a result for each test case, but without more specific information about the output, we can only describe the input parameters and the general structure of the function.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific nature of the result is not provided.**
