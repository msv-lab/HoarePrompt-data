The code snippet `total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))` appends the sum of a slice of the `costs` list to the `total_costs` list. The slice starts from index `i` and includes the next `k` elements. Given the initial state:

- `n` must be at least `k + 1`
- `i` is 1
- `costs` is a list of length `n`
- `total_costs` is a list with one element which is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`

The slice `costs[i:i + k]` will include the elements from index 1 to index `k` (i.e., `costs[1:1 + k]` or `costs[1:k + 1]`). The sum of these elements will be appended to `total_costs`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least `k + 1`, `i` is 1, `costs` is a list of length `n`, `total_costs` is a list with two elements: the first element is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`, and the second element is the sum of the elements from index 1 to index `k` of `costs`.**
