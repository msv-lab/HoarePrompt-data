The function `func` does not take any parameters. It reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following `t` lines contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. All `t` strings are distinct. The function processes these inputs and returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` from stdin, representing the number of test cases. It then reads `t` distinct strings of length 5, each consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case.**
