Output State: **`s` is updated to `c * c * m * i + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 2, `m` is a new integer greater than or equal to 3, `u` is the last integer value from the input, `v` is the last integer value from the input, `f` is the last integer value from the input, `a` is equal to the sum of all `f` values from the input, `n` is assigned a new integer value from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its current value.
- The current value of `s` is `c * c * m * i + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
- After the update, `s` becomes `c * c * m * i + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
- All other variables (`i`, `k`, `m`, `u`, `v`, `f`, `a`, `n`, `M`, `c`) remain unchanged.
