Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is not explicitly set before the loop but will be assigned values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop's execution, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a list of integers provided by the user.** 

The code snippet `M = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in the list `M`. The values of `t`, `_`, and `L` remain unchanged.
