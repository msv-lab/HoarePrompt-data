Output State: **`i` is `n - (n % 2)`, `n` remains the same, `p` is a list where `p[0]` is `n`, `p[2]` is `n - 2`, `p[4]` is `n - 4`, and so on, up to `p[n - (n % 2) - 2]` which is `n - (n - (n % 2) - 2)`, and the rest are zeros, `ind` is `1 + n % 2`, `iterations` is greater than the number of iterations completed.**

Explanation: The value of `ind` is updated to `1 + n % 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
