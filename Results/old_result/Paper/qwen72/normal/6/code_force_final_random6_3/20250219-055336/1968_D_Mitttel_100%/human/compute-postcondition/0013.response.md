Output State: **`a` and `p` remain unchanged, `s` is updated to `p[s]`, `k` is greater than 0, `n` remains unchanged, `mx` is updated to `max(mx, cur + k * a[s])`, `cur` is updated to `a[P_B] + a[P_S] + a[s]`, `vis` is updated such that `vis[P_B - 1]`, `vis[P_S - 1]`, and `vis[s]` are all set to 1.**

Explanation:
- `a` and `p` remain unchanged.
- `s` is updated to `p[s]`.
- `k` is still greater than 0.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `mx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `cur + k * a[s]`.
- `cur` is updated to `a[P_B] + a[P_S] + a[s]` after the code snippet `cur += a[s]` is executed.
- `vis` is updated such that `vis[P_B - 1]`, `vis[P_S - 1]`, and `vis[s]` are all set to 1.
