Postcondition: ***After the loop executes all the iterations, `bets` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `bets - 1`, and each element in `a` is updated to `prod // a[i]` where `i` ranges from 0 to `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`. Otherwise, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `bets` is greater than 0, and `ans` is a string containing the values of `str(a[0])`, `str(a[1])`, ..., `str(a[bets-1])` each followed by a space.***
