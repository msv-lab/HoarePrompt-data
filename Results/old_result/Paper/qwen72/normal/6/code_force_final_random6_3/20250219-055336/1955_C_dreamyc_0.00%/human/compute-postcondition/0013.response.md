Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing the elements of the original list `nums` minus the first and last elements, with `a` now added to the beginning, `ans` is 0, `a` and `b` are the first and last elements of the original `nums`, and `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 * `x`, then `a` is updated to `a - x`, `b` is updated to `b - x`, and `k` is updated to `k - 2 * x`. If `k` is less than 2 * `x`, then `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, the current value of `a` is greater than 0.**
