Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `lst` is a list of input integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `ldb` is a list containing the elements `lft[2]` and `lft[i]`, `rdb` and `sng` are empty lists.**

Explanation:
- The code `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends the element at index `i` (which is 2) of the list `lft` to the list `ldb`.
- Since `i` is 2 and `lft` is already sorted in ascending order, the element `lft[2]` is appended to `ldb`.
- The other variables (`T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `rdb`, `sng`) remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]` is assumed to be true, so `ldb` already contains `lft[1]` and now also contains `lft[2]`.
- The precondition that `rdb` and `sng` are empty lists remains valid.
