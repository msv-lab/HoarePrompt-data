Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of cell states `a`.

2. **Removing Leading and Trailing Zeros**: The program removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a`. This step is crucial because it effectively narrows down the problem to the segment of the ribbon that contains all the chips and the free cells between them.

3. **Counting Free Cells**: The program then counts the number of free cells (`0`s) within the segment that contains chips. This count represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the count of free cells within the segment containing chips.

This approach is correct because:
- Removing leading and trailing zeros ensures that we only consider the segment where chips and free cells are mixed.
- Counting the free cells within this segment gives the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together into a single block.

The program handles all the given examples correctly and should work for other valid inputs as well.
