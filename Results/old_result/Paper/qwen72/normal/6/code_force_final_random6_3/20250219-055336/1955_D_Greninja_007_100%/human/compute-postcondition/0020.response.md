Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq m < n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\), `b` is a list of \(m\) integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^6\), `cb` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m+1]` with `ca[a[m]]` incremented by 1 and `ca[a[0]]` decremented by 1, `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of common elements between `a[:m+1]` and `b` plus 1 if `ca[a[m]]` was less than `cb[a[m]]` before the increment and `ca[a[0]]` was greater than `cb[a[0]]` before the decrement, otherwise `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of common elements between `a[:m+1]` and `b` minus 1 if `ca[a[0]]` was equal to `cb[a[0]]` before the decrement, otherwise `sm` is `sm + 1`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2 and `r` is `m + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `r` is `m + 1`.**
