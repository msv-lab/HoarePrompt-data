Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `T` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `lst` is a list of input integers.
- `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order.
- `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `ldb` must have at least two elements.
- `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not equal to their preceding element and also not equal to their following element, provided `i` is less than `n - 1`.
- `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that are equal to their preceding element.
- `sz` is 2 if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `sz` remains 0.
- `elem` is the second element in `ldb`.
- The current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- `elem` is the second element in `ldb`.
- `ldb` must have at least two elements, so `elem` is a valid element.
- The `print` statement will print `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Output:
The code will print the second element in `ldb` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where elem is the second element in ldb)**
