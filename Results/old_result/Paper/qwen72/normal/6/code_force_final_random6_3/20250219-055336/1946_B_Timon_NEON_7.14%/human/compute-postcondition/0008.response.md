Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing [[0, 0, -1]], `max_sum` is -1, the condition `(new_segment)` is false, the first element of `arr` is less than 0, and `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])` appends the list `[0, 0, -1]` to `segments_variants`.
- `max_segment` remains `[0, 0]`.
- `i` remains `0`.
- `new_segment` remains an empty list.
- `max_sum` remains `-1`.
- The condition `(new_segment)` remains false.
- The first element of `arr` is still less than 0.
- `max_segment[0]` is still greater than `new_segment[0]`.
