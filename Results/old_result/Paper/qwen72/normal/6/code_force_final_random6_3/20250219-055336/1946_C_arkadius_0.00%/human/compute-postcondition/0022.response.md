Functionality: ** The function `func_4` accepts a tree with `n` vertices, the number of vertices `n`, and a number of edges to be removed `k`. It performs a binary search to find the maximum value `beg` such that a certain condition (determined by `func_3`) is satisfied for the given tree, `n`, `k`, and `mid`. The function returns this value `beg`, which is equal to `end` and `mid` after the search concludes. The tree remains unchanged. **
