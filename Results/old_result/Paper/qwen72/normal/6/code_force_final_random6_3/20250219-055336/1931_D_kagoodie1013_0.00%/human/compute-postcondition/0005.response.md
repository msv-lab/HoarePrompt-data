The only objects in the loop head are the variables `num` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, and `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the first tuple. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element, and `num` will be the first element of `arr`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the first tuple and must have at least one element, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`**
