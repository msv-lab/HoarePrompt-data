### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list `nums` of ship durabilities.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function converts the list `nums` into a deque to efficiently handle popping from both ends.
   - It initializes a counter `ans` to keep track of the number of ships sunk.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are at least two ships left and `k` is greater than 0.
   - It pops the first and last ship from the deque, reducing their durability by the minimum of the two.
   - If `k` is sufficient to reduce both ships by this minimum value, it does so and decrements `k` accordingly.
   - If a ship's durability is reduced to 0 or less, it is not added back to the deque, and `ans` is incremented.
   - If `k` is not sufficient to reduce both ships by the minimum value, the loop breaks.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, if there is exactly one ship left and `k` is sufficient to sink it, the function increments `ans` by 1.
   - The function returns the total number of ships sunk.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where `k` is very large and all ships are sunk.
   - It also handles cases where `k` is not sufficient to sink any ships or only a few ships.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The use of a deque ensures efficient popping from both ends, which is crucial for the problem's constraints.
   - The loop and conditions are designed to handle the maximum number of attacks and the maximum number of ships efficiently.

### Correctness:
