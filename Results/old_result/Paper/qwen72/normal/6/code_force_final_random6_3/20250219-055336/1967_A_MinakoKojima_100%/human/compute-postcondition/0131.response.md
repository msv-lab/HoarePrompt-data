Output State: **`a` remains a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is the final value after all iterations and is now `ans + k // n`, `ans_list` contains `a[0]`, `n` is the input integer, `k` is not 0, and `res` is the final value after all iterations.**

The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the integer division `k // n` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged.
