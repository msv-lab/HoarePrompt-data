### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices `prices`.

2. **Heap Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) `pq` with tuples of the form `(price, day)`, where `price` is the ticket price on a given day and `day` is the index of that day.
   - This allows the program to efficiently access the day with the lowest current price.

3. **Heap Operations:**
   - The program uses a while loop to continue purchasing tickets until the total number of tickets bought `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.
   - In each iteration, it pops the day with the lowest current price from the heap.
   - It then calculates the number of tickets to buy on that day, which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets allowed per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - The cost of buying these tickets is added to `total_cost`.
   - The number of tickets bought is incremented by the number of tickets purchased.
   - The price increase for subsequent days is updated by adding the number of tickets purchased.

4. **Price Increase:**
   - The price increase is correctly applied to the popped price before calculating the cost of buying tickets on that day.
   - This ensures that the prices for subsequent days are adjusted as per the problem statement.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total cost for each test case, which is the result of the function `func_1`.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The use of a min-heap ensures that the program always buys tickets on the day with the lowest current price, which is a greedy approach.
- The price increase is correctly applied to the popped price, ensuring that the prices for subsequent days are adjusted.
- The program correctly handles the constraints and ensures that no more than `m` tickets are bought on any single day.

### Detailed Evaluation:
- **Heap Initialization and Operations:**
  - The heap is initialized correctly with the initial prices and days.
  - The while loop ensures that tickets are bought until the required number `k` is reached.
  - The `min(m, k - tickets_bought)` ensures that the program does not buy more tickets than allowed per day or more than needed.
  - The price increase is correctly applied to the popped price, which is then used to calculate the cost.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `k` is less than or equal to `m` correctly by buying all required tickets on the cheapest day.
  - It also handles the case where `k` is much larger than `m` by distributing the purchases over multiple days while always choosing the cheapest available day.

- **Complexity:**
  - The time complexity of the program is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the heap operations, which is efficient given the constraints.
  - The space complexity is \(O(n)\) for storing the heap, which is also manageable.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It uses a min-heap to efficiently find the day with the lowest current price and applies the price increase correctly. The algorithm is consistent with the problem's constraints and requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
