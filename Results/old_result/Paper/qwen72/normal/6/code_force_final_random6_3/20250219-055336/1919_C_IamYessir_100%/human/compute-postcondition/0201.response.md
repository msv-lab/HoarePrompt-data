Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to infinity. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a` (which is now `lit[2]` because `lit[2]` was appended to `a`). If `len(b) > 0`, `y` is set to the last element of `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `2` of the list `lit` to the list `a`.
- Since `i` is 2, the value `lit[2]` is added to the end of `a`.
- The value of `x` is now the last element of `a`, which is `lit[2]`.
- The other variables (`b`, `s`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `_`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions for setting `y` to infinity or the last element of `b` remain the same as in the initial state.
