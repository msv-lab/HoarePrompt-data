Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info`, `suma` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `suma` to 0. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`) retain their initial values and conditions.
