Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`. If `y` is an even integer, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`. If `y` is an odd integer, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`.***
