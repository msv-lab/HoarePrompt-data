Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
   - `_` is `t-1`.
   - `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
   - `a` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
   - `b` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
   - `c` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
   - `results` is a list that includes the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` `t` times.
   - `results` must have at least 1 element.
   - `result` is the first element in the `results` list.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(result)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `n` is an integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
   - The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
   - The function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` is called `t` times, and the results are stored in the list `results`.
   - The list `results` is guaranteed to have at least one element.
   - The variable `result` is the first element of the `results` list.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `result` is the first element of the `results` list, and `results` is populated by calling `func_1(n, a, b, c)` `t` times, the value of `result` will be the result of the first call to `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the result of the first call to `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.

Output: **result (where result is the result of the first call to `func_1(n, a, b, c)`)**
