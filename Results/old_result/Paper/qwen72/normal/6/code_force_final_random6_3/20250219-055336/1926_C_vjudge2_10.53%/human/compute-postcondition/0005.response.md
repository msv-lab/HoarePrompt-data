The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0. After the last iteration, `_` is incremented by 1, so `_` is now 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `numbers` is a list containing the input integer `n`, `n` is an input integer.**
