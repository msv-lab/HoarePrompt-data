Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\).
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 26\).
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 26\).
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 1000\).
   - `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `win` is an empty set.
   - `ans` is a list containing the characters of `s` that were the last character to complete a set of `k` unique characters in `s`.
   - `ps` is the number of times the set `win` was cleared, and `ps` is less than `n`.
   - `i` is the first element of `us`, and `i` is not in `win`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `ans` is a list of characters from `s` that were the last to complete a set of `k` unique characters.
   - `i` is the first element of the set `us`, which contains the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. Since `i` is not in `win`, it is one of the characters from `us` that has not been used in the current window.
   - The expression `'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)` generates a string of `a` characters repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.
   - The `print` statement concatenates the string formed by joining the elements of `ans`, the character `i`, and the string of `a` characters.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - `ans` is a list of characters, so `''.join(ans)` will form a string from these characters.
   - `i` is the first element of `us` that is not in `win`.
   - The number of `a` characters added is `n - len(ans) - 1`.

Given the initial state, the output will be a string that starts with the characters in `ans`, followed by the character `i`, and then a string of `a` characters repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.

Output: **[characters in ans] + [i] + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1) (where [characters in ans] is the string formed by joining the elements of ans, [i] is the first element of us that is not in win, and 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1) is a string of 'a' characters repeated n - len(ans) - 1 times)**
