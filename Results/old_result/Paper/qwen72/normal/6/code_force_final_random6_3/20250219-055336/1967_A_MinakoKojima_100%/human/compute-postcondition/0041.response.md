Postcondition: ***`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` is updated to `0 - dif * 2` and `ans` is set to `a[2] - a[1]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 3`. Otherwise, `res` is `n - 4`. If `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` remains 0, `ans` is set to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `res` is `n - 3`.***
