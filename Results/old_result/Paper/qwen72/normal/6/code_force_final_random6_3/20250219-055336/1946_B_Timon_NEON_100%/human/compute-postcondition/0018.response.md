Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `max_sum` is -1, and `new_segment` is a non-empty list. If `arr[0]` < 0, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[0]`, and if `max_segment[0]` > `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing a single element `[0, 0, -1]`. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [i - 1]. If `arr[0]` >= 0, `new_segment` is a non-empty list where the first element is increased by `arr[0]`, `max_segment` is updated to `[arr[0], 0]`, and `segments_variants` remains an empty list.***
