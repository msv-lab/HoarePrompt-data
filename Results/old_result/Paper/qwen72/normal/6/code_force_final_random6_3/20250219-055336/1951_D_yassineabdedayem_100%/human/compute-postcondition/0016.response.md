Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers. If `n` is equal to `k`, the condition `n == k` holds. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`, and if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` holds; otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.***
