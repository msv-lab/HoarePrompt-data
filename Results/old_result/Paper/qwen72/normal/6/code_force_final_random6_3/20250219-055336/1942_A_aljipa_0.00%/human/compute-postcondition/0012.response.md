Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `n` and `k` are input integers.
2. `t` must be greater than 2 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet, it is mentioned as a precondition).
3. `res` is a list that is determined by the values of `n` and `k`:
   - If `k == n`, `res` is a list of `n` ones.
   - If `k == 1`, `res` is a list containing the range from 0 to `n-1`.
   - Otherwise, `res` is a list containing `-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*res)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(*res)` statement will unpack the list `res` and print its elements separated by spaces.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **If `k == n`:**
   - `res` will be a list of `n` ones.
   - For example, if `n = 5`, then `res = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
   - The output will be: `1 1 1 1 1`.

2. **If `k == 1`:**
   - `res` will be a list containing the range from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For example, if `n = 5`, then `res = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - The output will be: `0 1 2 3 4`.

3. **Otherwise:**
   - `res` will be a list containing `-1`.
   - For example, if `n = 5` and `k` is any value other than 1 or 5, then `res = [-1]`.
   - The output will be: `-1`.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be:

- If `k == n`, the output will be: **1 1 1 ... 1 (n times)**
- If `k == 1`, the output will be: **0 1 2 ... (n-1)**
- Otherwise, the output will be: **-1**

Output: **1 1 1 ... 1 (n times) if k == n, 0 1 2 ... (n-1) if k == 1, otherwise -1**
