Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 < n <= 18`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` from index 0 to 1 and from index 5 to `n-1` plus 9, `r` is 1, `l` is the value of `j` where the maximum `sm` was found, and `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during all iterations of the loop. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `r` is 2, `l` is 3, and `over_sum` is updated to the value of `sm`. Otherwise, `r` remains 1 and `over_sum` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `sm` is updated to the sum of elements in `lst` from index 0 to 1 and from index 5 to `n-1` (since `j + 1` is 5), plus the square of the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1, which is 9 (since `(j - i + 1) ** 2` is `(4 - 2 + 1) ** 2` which equals 9).
- The values of `i`, `j`, `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` remain unchanged unless `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, in which case `r` becomes 2, `l` becomes 3, and `over_sum` is updated to the value of `sm`.
