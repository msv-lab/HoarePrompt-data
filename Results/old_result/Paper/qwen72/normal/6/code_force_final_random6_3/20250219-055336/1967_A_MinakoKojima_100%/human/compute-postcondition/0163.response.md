Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans_list` contains `a[0]` and `a[0]`, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, and `dif` is not 0. If `k` is 0, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `res` remains `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the initial condition. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is set to `a[0] + dif`, `k` is updated to `k - dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is set to `n - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `a[0]`, `k` is set to 0, and `res` remains `n - 1`.***
