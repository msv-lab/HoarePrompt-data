Output State: **`nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` has at least `n` elements, `in_aa` is the first element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element of `aa[:n - m]`, `tot` is the sum of all values in the dictionary `D`. If `D[out_aa]` > 0, then `E[out_aa]` is now `E[out_aa] - 1` and is greater than or equal to 0, and `D[out_aa]` is greater than or equal to 0. If `D[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, then `D[out_aa]` is now `D[out_aa] - 1`, `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, `C[out_aa]` is now `C[out_aa] + 1`, and `D[out_aa]` is greater than or equal to 0. If `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` > 0, then `C[in_aa]` is now `D[in_aa] + 1` if `C[in_aa]` was equal to `D[in_aa]`, otherwise `D[in_aa]` is now `D[in_aa] + 1`. If `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0, then `E[in_aa]` is now `E[in_aa] + 1` and `C[in_aa]` remains not greater than 0.**
