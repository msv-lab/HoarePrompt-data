Output State: **`num` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9, and the length of `num` is an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `m` is an integer (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6), `i` is -1. `counter` is the number of trailing '0's in the list `num` up to the first non-'0' element, or 0 if there are no trailing '0's.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from the last element of the list `num` to the first element, decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop stops when it encounters the first non-'0' element or when `i` becomes -1 (which means the loop has iterated through all elements).
- `counter` is incremented by 1 for each '0' encountered, starting from the last element and moving backwards.
- If the list `num` does not contain any trailing '0's, `counter` remains 0.
- After the loop finishes, `i` will be -1, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations.
