The only objects in the loop head are `u` and `tree.vertices[v].children`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `tree.vertices[v].children`. If this list has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 2 elements, and `u` is the second element in `tree.vertices[v].children`. For the loop to execute one more time, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 3 elements, and `u` will be the third element in `tree.vertices[v].children`.

State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains the same elements as before, plus the tuple `(v, True)` at the top, and the tuple `(u, False)` is appended to the top of `stack`. `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 3 elements, and `u` is the third element in `tree.vertices[v].children`.**
