Output State: **`a` is a list where the last element is not 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `t` is greater than 0, and `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `a` from index 0 to `len(a) - 1`.
- For each iteration, if the element at index `i` is 0, the variable `res` is incremented by 1.
- After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 1`, which is the last index of the list.
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `res` will contain the total count of zeros in the list `a`.
