Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [i - 1], `max_sum` is -1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0. Additionally, `max_segment[0]` is less than or equal to `new_segment[0]`.**

Explanation:
- `segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])` adds a new element to the `segments_variants` list. This element is the list `new_segment` with the value `i - 1` appended to it.
- Since `i` is 0, `i - 1` is -1.
- Therefore, `segments_variants` now contains one element which is `new_segment` + [-1].
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
