Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `n` and `x`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to find all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - It iterates from 1 to the square root of `x` and checks if `x` is divisible by `i`.
   - If `x` is divisible by `i`, it adds both `i` and `x // i` to the list of divisors.
   - It then reverses the list of smaller divisors and concatenates it with the list of larger divisors to ensure all divisors are included.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, the program checks two conditions:
     - If `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`, it calls `func_1(n + x - 2)` to get the divisors.
     - If `(n - x) % 2 == 0`, it calls `func_1(n - x)` to get the divisors.
   - For each divisor `s` found, it checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
   - If both conditions are met, it appends `(s + 2) / 2` to the list `output`.
   - Finally, it removes duplicates from `output` by converting it to a set and prints the length of the set, which represents the number of valid `k` values.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The logic for finding divisors and checking the conditions is correct.
   - The conditions ensure that the resulting `k` values are valid according to the problem constraints.
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.
