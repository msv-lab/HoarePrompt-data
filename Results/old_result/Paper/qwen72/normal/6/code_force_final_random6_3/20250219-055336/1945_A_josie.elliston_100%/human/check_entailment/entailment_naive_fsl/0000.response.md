Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly account for the requirement that each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others. Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1 2 2
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Actual Output:
```
2
```

Explanation of the case:
- There is 1 introvert, 2 extroverts, and 2 universals.
- The introvert will need 1 tent.
- The 2 extroverts need to be in a tent with exactly 2 others, so they will need 1 tent with 2 universals.
- The remaining 2 universals can share 1 tent.

Thus, the total number of tents required is 3, but the program outputs 2, which is incorrect.
