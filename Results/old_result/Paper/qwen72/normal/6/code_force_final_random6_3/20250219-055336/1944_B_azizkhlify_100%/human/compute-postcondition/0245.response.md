To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step:

Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.

Code Snippet:
```
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. The variable `i` is set to 1.
2. The `print` statement is printing the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Since the initial state does not provide the explicit value of `a[i]` or the list `a`, we can only describe the output in terms of the value at index 1 of the list `a`.

Output: **a[1] a[1] (where a[1] is the value at index 1 of the list `a`)**
