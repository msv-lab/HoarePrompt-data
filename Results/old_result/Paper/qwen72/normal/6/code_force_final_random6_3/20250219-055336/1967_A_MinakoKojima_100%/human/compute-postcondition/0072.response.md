Output State: **`a` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is `ans_initial + (ans_initial - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, where `res` is the number of unique elements in `a` minus 1, `ans_list` contains `ans`, `n` and `k` are input integers.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order.
- The values of `ans`, `ans_list`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The initial state information about `a` being a list of integers provided by the user is still valid, but now `a` is sorted.
- The expression for `ans` and the contents of `ans_list` remain as they were in the initial state.
