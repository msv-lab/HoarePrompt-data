Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `path` is a list that includes `v` and at most one other vertex from the initial `remaining_vertices` set, `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one vertex, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. The current value of `v` is in `remaining_vertices`.**

Explanation:
- The code `path.append(v)` adds the value `v` to the list `path`.
- Initially, `path` includes at most one vertex from the `remaining_vertices` set.
- After appending `v`, `path` now includes `v` and at most one other vertex.
- The other variables (`n`, `d`, `remaining_vertices`, `v`, `u`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `v` is still in `remaining_vertices`, and `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one vertex.
