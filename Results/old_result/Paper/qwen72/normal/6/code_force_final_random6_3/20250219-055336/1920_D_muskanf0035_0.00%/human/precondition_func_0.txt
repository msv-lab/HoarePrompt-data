n is a positive integer, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple (op_type, value) has op_type as an integer in {1, 2} and value as a positive integer, and queries is a list of positive integers such that 1 <= k <= min(10^18, c) for each k in queries, where c is the length of the array after all operations.
