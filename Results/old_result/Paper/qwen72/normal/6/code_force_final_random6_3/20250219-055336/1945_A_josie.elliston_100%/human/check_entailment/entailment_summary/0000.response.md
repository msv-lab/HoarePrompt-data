### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate introverts, extroverts, and universals according to their preferences.
   - Introverts must live alone (1 tent per introvert).
   - Extroverts must live in a tent with exactly two others.
   - Universals can live in any tent configuration (alone, with one other, or with two others).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(extroverts, universals)`**:
     - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
     - If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to form a full tent.
     - If the sum of the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 and `universals` is less than 3, it returns `None` (indicating it's impossible to form a full tent).
     - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

   - **`func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)`**:
     - This function combines the results of `func_1` with the number of introverts.
     - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
     - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
     - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts (each needing a separate tent) to the result of `func_1` and returns the total number of tents.

3. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Test Case 1: (1, 2, 3)**
     - `func_1(2, 3)`: 2 extroverts need 2 more people to form a tent. 3 universals can fill this requirement.
     - Result: 2 extroverts + 3 universals = 5 people, which can fit into 2 tents.
     - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 2 (extroverts + universals) = 3.
   - **Test Case 2: (1, 4, 1)**
     - `func_1(4, 1)`: 4 extroverts need 2 more people to form a tent. 1 universal is not enough.
     - Result: `None` (impossible).
     - Total tents: -1.
   - **Test Case 3: (1, 4, 2)**
     - `func_1(4, 2)`: 4 extroverts need 2 more people to form a tent. 2 universals can fill this requirement.
     - Result: 4 extroverts + 2 universals = 6 people, which can fit into 2 tents.
     - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 2 (extroverts + universals) = 3.
   - **Test Case 4: (1, 1, 1)**
     - `func_1(1, 1)`: 1 extrovert needs 2 more people to form a tent. 1 universal is not enough.
     - Result: `None` (impossible).
     - Total tents: -1.
   - **Test Case 5: (1, 3, 2)**
     - `func_1(3, 2)`: 3 extroverts can form 1 tent. 2 universals can form another tent.
     - Result: 3 extroverts + 2 universals = 5 people, which can fit into 2 tents.
     - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 2 (extroverts + universals) = 3.
   - **Test Case 6: (19, 7, 18)**
     - `func_1(7, 18)`: 7 extroverts need 14 more people to form 3 tents. 18 universals can fill this requirement.
     - Result: 7 extroverts + 18 universals = 25 people, which can fit into 9 tents.
     - Total tents: 19 (introverts) + 9 (extroverts + universals) = 28.
   - **Test Case 7: (0, 0, 0)**
     - `func_1(0, 0)`: No extroverts or universals, so 0 tents are needed.
     - Result: 0.
     - Total tents: 0 (introverts) + 0 (extroverts + universals) = 0.
   - **Test Case 8: (7, 0, 0)**
     - `func_1(0, 0)`: No extroverts or universals, so 0 tents are needed.
     - Result: 0.
     - Total tents: 7 (introverts) + 0 (extroverts + universals) = 7.
   - **Test Case 9: (0, 24, 0)**
     - `func_1(24, 0)`: 24 extroverts can form 8 tents.
     - Result: 8.
     - Total tents: 0 (introverts) + 8 (extroverts + universals) = 8.
   - **Test Case 10: (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)**
     - `func_1(1000000000, 1000000000)`: 1000000000 extroverts can form 333333334 tents. 1000000000 universals can form 333333334 tents.
     - Result: 333333334 + 333333334 = 666666668 people, which can fit into 333333334 tents.
     - Total tents: 1000000000 (introverts) + 333333334 (extroverts + universals) = 1333333334.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and meets the problem description. It ensures that introverts are given their own tents, extroverts are paired with universals to form full tents, and universals are used to fill any remaining spots. If it's impossible to form full tents for extroverts, it returns -1.

**Correctness: True**
