The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

The state of `last` and the condition involving `a[2]` and `a[1]` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3.**
