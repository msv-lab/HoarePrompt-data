Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` contains all its original characters with leading and trailing spaces removed.
   - `a` contains all unique characters from `s`.
   - `i` has iterated through each character in `s`.
   - The length of `a` is less than or equal to 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'NO'`.
   - The initial state provides information about the variables `s` and `a`, but it does not affect the `print` statement directly.
   - The condition that the length of `a` is less than or equal to 1 suggests that `s` either contains no characters or only one unique character. However, this information is not used in the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `s` and `a`.

Output: **NO**
