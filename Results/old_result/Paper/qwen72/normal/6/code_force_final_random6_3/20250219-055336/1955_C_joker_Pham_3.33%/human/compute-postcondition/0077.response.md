Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0, 1, 1, or 2, `r` is n - 1, n - 2, n - 2, or n - 3 depending on the initial values and updates within the if block, `sunks` is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 depending on the initial value and updates within the if block. If `a[l] <= a[r]`, and `k` >= `a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l-1]`, `k` is updated to `k - a[l-1] * 2`, `l` is updated to 1 or 2, `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3` if `a[r]` was 0, otherwise `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, and `sunks` is updated to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 if `a[r]` was 0, otherwise `sunks` is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. If `a[l] <= a[r]` and `k` < `a[l] * 2`, or if `l` == `r`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
