The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `x` is `x - 1`, which means `x` has already been decremented by 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must be a non-zero value. Since the function accepts an integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) as input, and `x` is now `x - 1`, the initial value of `X` must have been at least 2 to ensure `x` is at least 1 before the loop starts.

State: **The function should accept an integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) as input, and the integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. `x` is now `x - 1` and must be greater than 0. `subseq_lens` is an empty list. `mx` is 0.**
