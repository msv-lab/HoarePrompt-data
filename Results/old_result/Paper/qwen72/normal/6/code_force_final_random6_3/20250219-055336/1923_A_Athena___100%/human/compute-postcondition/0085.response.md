Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 0 but less than the original `t`, `n` is an input integer. If the first element of `a` is 0, `res` is 2. If the first element of `a` is not 0 and `a[i]` is 0, `res` is 2. If the first element of `a` is not 0 and `a[i]` is not 0, `res` is 0.***
