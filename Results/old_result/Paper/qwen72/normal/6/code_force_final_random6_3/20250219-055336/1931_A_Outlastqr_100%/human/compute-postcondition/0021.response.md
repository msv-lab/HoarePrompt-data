Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 3 to 78, `i` is 1, `word` is a string containing the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string followed by 'zz'.**

Explanation: The code appends the character at the index `n - 53` from the `alphabet` string and the string 'zz' to the `word` variable. The value of `n` is still within the range 3 to 78, and `i` remains 1. The `word` variable, which was initially an empty string, now contains the character from `alphabet` at the specified index followed by 'zz'.
