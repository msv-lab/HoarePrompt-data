Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0, `ls` is now `nums[0]`, `i` is 1, `nums[0]` is the same as before, `len(nums)` is at least 1, and `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - nums[0]`.**

The value of `nums[1]` is updated to be `nums[1] - nums[0]`, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
