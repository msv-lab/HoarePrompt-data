Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the problem description. The logic in the program checks the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins. This works because the game is essentially a parity game where the player who starts with the odd turn (Alice) will win if the total number of coins is odd, and the player who starts with the even turn (Bob) will win if the total number of coins is even. The program implements this logic correctly and will produce the expected output for the given input.
