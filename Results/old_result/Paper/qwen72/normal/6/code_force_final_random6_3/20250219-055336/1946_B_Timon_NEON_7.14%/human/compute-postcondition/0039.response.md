The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` must be incremented by 1, and the list `arr` must still have at least two elements remaining to be processed.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `arr` must have at least one more element to be processed, meaning `arr` must have at least three elements in total.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `i` is 2, and `max_sum` is -1. If `arr[0]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is set to [first element of `arr` + `arr[1]`, 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1]]. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to [arr[0] + arr[1]], `max_segment` is set to [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing [[arr[0], 0, 0]]. If `arr[0]` is less than 0 and `new_segment` is not set, `segments_variants` remains as [[first element of `arr`, 0, -1]]. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `new_segment` is not set, `new_segment` is set to [arr[1], 1], and `segments_variants` remains an empty list.**
