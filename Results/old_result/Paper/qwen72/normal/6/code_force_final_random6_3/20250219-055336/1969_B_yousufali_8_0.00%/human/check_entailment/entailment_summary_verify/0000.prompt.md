You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, and then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function concludes, `t` is the number of times `func_1` was called, and the final state of the program includes the side effects of `func_1` being called `t` times.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input format and the logic for calculating the minimum cost to sort the binary string. Specifically:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` expects a list of integers, but the input is a binary string. The `input().split()` method is used to split a string into a list of substrings, which is not appropriate here. Instead, the input should be read as a single string.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost**: The logic in `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string. The program increments `ans` by `n + 1` whenever it encounters a `0` and `n` is not zero. This does not follow the problem's requirement to find the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts to sort the string.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
For the input:
```
5
10
0000
11000
101011
01101001
```
The expected output is:
```
2
0
9
5
11
```
However, the program will produce incorrect results because it does not correctly parse the input as a binary string and does not correctly calculate the minimum cost.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that follows the problem description:

```python
def min_cost_to_sort(s):
    n = len(s)
    ones = 0
    cost = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            ones += 1
        else:
            cost += ones
    return cost

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        print(min_cost_to_sort(s))

# Example usage
func_2()
```

This corrected program reads the input correctly as a binary string and calculates the minimum cost to sort the string by counting the number of `1`s before each `0` and summing these counts. This approach ensures that the string is sorted in non-descending order with the minimum total cost.
