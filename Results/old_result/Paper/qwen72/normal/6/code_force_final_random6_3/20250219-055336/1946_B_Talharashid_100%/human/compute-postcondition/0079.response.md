Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`, `c` is increased by the value of `ele`, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The values of `n` and `k` remain as input integers greater than 0.
- The list `l` remains a list of integers with at least 3 elements.
- `ele` remains the third element in the list `l`.
- `c` has been increased by the value of `ele`.
- `maxi` is updated to the maximum of the new value of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.
