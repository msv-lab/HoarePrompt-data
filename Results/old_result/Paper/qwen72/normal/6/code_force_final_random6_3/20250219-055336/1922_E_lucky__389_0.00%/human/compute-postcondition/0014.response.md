Output State: **The function should accept an integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) as input, and the integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. `x` is now `x - 1` and must be greater than 0. `subseq_lens` is an empty list. `mx` is 0. `i` is the largest integer such that 2^i <= x + 1, and the current value of `i` is 0. `x` must be at least 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
