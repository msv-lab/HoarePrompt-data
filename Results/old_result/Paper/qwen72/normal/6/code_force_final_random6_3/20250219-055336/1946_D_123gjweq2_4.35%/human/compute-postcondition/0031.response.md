Output State: **The program returns -1 if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is set to 1. Otherwise, it returns the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`, where `new_arr` is a list containing the cumulative XOR values of the elements in `cur_arr` that had the bit at position `bit` set to 0 at the time of their XOR operation, and `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1.**
