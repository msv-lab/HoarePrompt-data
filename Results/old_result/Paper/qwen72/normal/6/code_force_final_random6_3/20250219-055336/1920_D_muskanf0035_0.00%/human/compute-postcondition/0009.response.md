Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, and the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from the input, `queries` is a list of integers, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is incremented by `n`, and `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`. `n` and `q` are now specific positive integers within the given constraints.**

Explanation:
- The variable `operations` is now a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from the input.
- The variable `_` is incremented by `n` because the list comprehension runs `n` times.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `queries`, `result`) remain unchanged, and their initial conditions still hold.
