Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` within the range \(1 \le x \le 10^9\) and returns a list containing all divisors of `x`. The list is composed of two parts: the first part contains all divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`, and the second part contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in reverse order. **
