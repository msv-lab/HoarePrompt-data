Output State: **`T` is an input integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 1000, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers.** 

The initial state remains unchanged for `T` and `i`. The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values of two integers input by the user, which are split and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
