Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, `screen_require_for_y` is the same as in the initial state, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` is equal to `x * 1 - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)`, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1`.**

The code snippet calculates the value of `extra_screen` based on the value of `extra_space`. `extra_screen` is assigned the value of `extra_space` divided by 15, using integer division, plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
