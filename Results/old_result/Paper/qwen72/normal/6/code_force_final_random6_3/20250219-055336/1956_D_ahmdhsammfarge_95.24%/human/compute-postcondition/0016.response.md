Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n, where 3 <= n <= 18, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `sm` is `sum(lst[4:]) + 16`, `r` is 0, `l` is 3, and if `sm` > `over_sum`, then `over_sum` is equal to `sm` and `l` is 2; otherwise, `over_sum` remains unchanged and `l` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The variables `r` and `l` are updated to the values of `i` and `j` respectively.
- `i` is 0 and `j` is 3, so `r` is now 0 and `l` is now 3.
- The other variables (`lst`, `i`, `j`, `sm`, `over_sum`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for `over_sum` and `l` is still in effect, but the values of `r` and `l` have been updated.
