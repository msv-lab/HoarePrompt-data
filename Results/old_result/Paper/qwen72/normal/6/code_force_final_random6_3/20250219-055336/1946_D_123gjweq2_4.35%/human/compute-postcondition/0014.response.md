Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the value `xor`, `xor` is the result of `xor` XOR `i`, and `thing1` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `xor` is appended to `new_arr`.
- The initial condition that `new_arr` is an empty list if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, or a list containing the value `xor` otherwise, is no longer relevant because `new_arr` now contains the value `xor`.
- The values of `cur_arr`, `i`, `bit`, and `thing1` remain unchanged.
- The value of `xor` remains the result of `xor` XOR `i`.
