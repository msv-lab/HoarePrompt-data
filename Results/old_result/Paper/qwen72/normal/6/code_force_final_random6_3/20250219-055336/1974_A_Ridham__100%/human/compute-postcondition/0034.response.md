Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, `screen_require_for_y` is the same as in the initial state, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` is equal to `x * 1 - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)`**

Explanation:
- `extra_space` is assigned the value of `space_x - remaining_cells`.
- `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`.
- `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
- `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.
- Therefore, `extra_space` is equal to `x * 1 - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)`.
- The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
