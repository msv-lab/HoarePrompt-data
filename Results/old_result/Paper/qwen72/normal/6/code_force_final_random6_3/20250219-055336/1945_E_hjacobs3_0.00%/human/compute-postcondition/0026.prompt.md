You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and find is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n.
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1
        
    #State: `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` >= `find`, and `r` is `l` - 1.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the value of `l + 1` converted to a string, and the second string is the index of `find` in `array` plus 1, also converted to a string.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: *`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` >= `find`, and `r` is `l` - 1. Additionally, `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `array` of integers representing a permutation of size `n` and an integer `find` within the range 1 to `n`. It returns a list of two strings: the first string is the value of `l + 1` (where `l` is not defined in the input), and the second string is the index of `find` in `array` plus 1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the value of `l + 1` converted to a string, and the second string is the index of `find` in `array` plus 1, also converted to a string.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
