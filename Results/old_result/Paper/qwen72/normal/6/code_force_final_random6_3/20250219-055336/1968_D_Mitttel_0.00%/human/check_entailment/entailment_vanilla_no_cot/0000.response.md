Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game" as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes the game parameters and the permutation and array as inputs.
   - It calculates the scores for both Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position.
   - It keeps track of the current position, the score, and the number of steps taken.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to detect cycles in the permutation.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by considering the cycle length and the score accumulated within one cycle.
   - This ensures that the function can handle large values of `k` efficiently by avoiding unnecessary repeated calculations.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It collects the results and prints them at the end.

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as detecting cycles and calculating scores for large `k` values. Therefore, the program is correct.
