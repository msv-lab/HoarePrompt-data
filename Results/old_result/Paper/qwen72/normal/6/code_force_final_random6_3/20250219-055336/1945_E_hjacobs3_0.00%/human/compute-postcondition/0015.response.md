Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `mid` is (`l` + `r`) // 2, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`.** 

The value of `mid` is updated to the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
