Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than `n * 2`, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans` (which is 0), `n` is the new input integer, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than `n * 2`, `i` is 0, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers, and the first and third elements of `lst` have been removed. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the minimum of the two integers in `lst`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than `n * 2`, `i` is 1, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, and `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `ans` is updated to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, and the first and third elements of `lst` are removed. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is updated to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than `n * 2`, `i` is 2, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, and `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter. If `len(lst) != 2`, `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first and second elements of the original `lst` converted to integers, and `lst` has the first and third elements removed. If `len(lst) == 2`, `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
