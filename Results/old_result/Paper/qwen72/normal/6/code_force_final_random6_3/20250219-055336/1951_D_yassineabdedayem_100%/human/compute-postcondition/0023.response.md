The provided Python code snippet is:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides several conditions and variables, but none of them are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement simply prints the integer `2`.

### Variables and Conditions:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` and `k` are new input integers.
- If `n` is equal to `k`, the condition `n == k` holds.
- Otherwise, if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` holds.
- Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.
- It simply prints the integer `2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2**
