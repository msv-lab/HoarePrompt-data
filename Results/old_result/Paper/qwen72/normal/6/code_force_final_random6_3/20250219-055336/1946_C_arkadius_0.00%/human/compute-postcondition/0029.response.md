Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `v` is equal to `s`, `u` is the third child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the `remaining_size` attribute of the vertex `v` in the `tree` object by adding the `remaining_size` attribute of the vertex `u`. The initial state remains unchanged except for the updated `remaining_size` of `v`.
