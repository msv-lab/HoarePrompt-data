The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, which represents the number of pairs of integers `(x, y)` to process. For each pair `(x, y)`, it calculates the number of screens required based on the space occupied by `x` and `y`. The space occupied by `y` is `y * 4`, and the space occupied by `x` is `x * 1`. If `y` is even, the number of screens required for `y` is `y // 2`; if `y` is odd, it is `y // 2 + 1`. The function then checks if the space occupied by `x` fits into the remaining cells on the screens allocated for `y`. If it does, the total number of screens required is the number of screens for `y`. If it doesn't, the function calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining `x` space and adds this to the total. The function prints the number of screens required for each pair `(x, y)` on a new line.
