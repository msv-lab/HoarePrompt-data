### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function initializes `l` to count the number of 'L' commands in the string `s`.
   - It initializes `k` to the modulo result of the element that will be removed last, based on the last command in `s`.
   - It sets `q1` and `q2` to track the positions of the elements to be removed next.

3. **Output List Initialization:**
   - The function initializes a list `y` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.

4. **Final Command Processing:**
   - The function correctly sets the last element of `y` to the modulo result of the last element to be removed.

5. **Command Processing Loop:**
   - The function iterates from the second last command to the first command.
   - For each command, it updates `k` by multiplying it with the appropriate element from `a` and taking the modulo `m`.
   - It updates `q1` or `q2` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
   - It sets the corresponding element in `y` to the updated value of `k`.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the list `y` for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Initialization of `k`:**
  - The initialization of `k` is incorrect. It should be the product of all elements in `a` modulo `m` before any commands are processed.
  - The current initialization only sets `k` to the last element to be removed, which is not the correct initial product.

- **Incorrect Update of `q1` and `q2`:**
  - The variables `q1` and `q2` are not correctly tracking the positions of the elements to be removed.
  - `q1` should start from 0 and `q2` should start from `n-1`, and they should be updated based on the commands.

### Corrected Approach:
- Initialize `k` to the product of all elements in `a` modulo `m`.
- Use `q1` and `q2` to track the current positions of the leftmost and rightmost elements to be removed.
- Update `k` by multiplying it with the appropriate element and taking the modulo `m` for each command.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False****

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for ii in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = input()
        
        # Initialize k to the product of all elements in a modulo m
        k = 1
        for num in a:
            k = (k * num) % m
        
        # Initialize q1 and q2 to track the positions of the elements to be removed
        q1 = 0
        q2 = n - 1
        
        y = [0] * n
        for i in range(n):
            y[i] = k
            if s[i] == 'L':
                k = (k * pow(a[q1], -1, m)) % m
                q1 += 1
            else:
                k = (k * pow(a[q2], -1, m)) % m
                q2 -= 1
        
        print(*y)

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initialization of `k`:** The product of all elements in `a` is computed and taken modulo `m`.
- **Tracking Positions:** `q1` and `q2` are used to track the leftmost and rightmost elements to be removed.
- **Modulo Inverse:** When an element is removed, the product is updated by multiplying with the modular inverse of the removed element to maintain the correct product modulo `m`.
- **Output:** The list `y` is correctly updated and printed for each test case.
