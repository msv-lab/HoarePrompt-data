Reasoning: 

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not implement the game logic as described in the problem. Instead, it simply calculates the difference between the number of cards and the number of unique cards in the input line, which is not the correct approach to determine the maximum number of points a player can get by playing optimally.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

1. Parse the input to get the number of test cases, the number of cards, and the cards in the player's hand.
2. For each test case, simulate the game by considering the optimal moves for both players.
3. Track the cards on the table and the points scored by the player.
4. Output the maximum number of points the player can get.

The current program does not perform any of these steps. It only reads every third line from the input and calculates a simple difference, which does not reflect the game's rules or the optimal play strategy.

Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
