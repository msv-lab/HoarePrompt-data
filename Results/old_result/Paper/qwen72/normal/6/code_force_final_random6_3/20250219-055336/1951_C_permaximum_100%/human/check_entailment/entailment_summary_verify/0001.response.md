### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices `prices`.

2. **Heap Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) `pq` with tuples of the form `(price, day)`, where `price` is the ticket price on a given day and `day` is the index of that day.
   - This allows the program to efficiently access the day with the lowest current price.

3. **Heap Operations:**
   - The program uses a while loop to continue purchasing tickets until the total number of tickets bought `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.
   - In each iteration, it pops the day with the lowest current price from the heap.
   - It then calculates the number of tickets to buy on that day, which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets allowed per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - The cost of buying these tickets is added to `total_cost`.
   - The number of tickets bought is incremented by the number of tickets purchased.
   - The price increase for subsequent days is updated by adding the number of tickets purchased.

4. **Price Increase:**
   - The price increase is correctly applied to the popped price before calculating the cost of buying tickets on that day.
   - This ensures that the prices for subsequent days are adjusted as per the problem statement.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total cost for each test case, which is the result of the function `func_1`.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The use of a min-heap ensures that the program always buys tickets on the day with the lowest current price, which is a greedy approach.
- The price increase is correctly applied to the popped price, ensuring that the prices for subsequent days are adjusted.
- The program correctly handles the constraints and ensures that no more than `m` tickets are bought on any single day.

### Potential Issues:
- **Heap Reinsertion:** The original assessment does not mention that the program should reinsert the day back into the heap with the updated price. This is crucial because the price of a day can change after tickets are bought on that day, and the heap should reflect these changes.
- **Day Reinsertion:** After buying tickets on a day, the day's price is increased, and the day should be reinserted into the heap with the new price to ensure the heap always contains the correct and updated prices.

### Corrected Code:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, m, k, prices)
    print(result)

def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    import heapq
    pq = [(price, i) for (i, price) in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        (price, day) = heapq.heappop(pq)
        price += price_increase
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        # Reinsert the day with the updated price
        heapq.heappush(pq, (price, day))
    return total_cost
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was accurate in most aspects, but it missed the crucial step of reinserting the day back into the heap with the updated price.
- This step is necessary to ensure that the heap always contains the correct and updated prices, which is essential for the greedy approach to work correctly.

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not reinsert the day back into the heap with the updated price, which can lead to incorrect results in some cases.
