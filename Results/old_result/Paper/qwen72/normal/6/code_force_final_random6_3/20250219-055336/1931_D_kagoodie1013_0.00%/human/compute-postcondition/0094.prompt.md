You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a. Each n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, each x and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and each a is a list of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        
        mod_x_map = {}
        
        mod_y_map = {}
        
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = -num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
            mod_x_key = num % x
            mod_y_key = num % y
            mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
            mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that has been fully iterated through. `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` for each tuple in `test_cases`. Each `count` is the sum of all values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for each `num` in the corresponding `arr`. `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are dictionaries that have been updated for each tuple, where `mod_x_map` contains the count of each unique `num % x` and `mod_y_map` contains the count of each unique `num % y` for the corresponding `arr`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` where each element is the sum of all values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for each `num` in the corresponding `arr` from the `test_cases` list. `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are dictionaries that have been updated for each tuple in `test_cases`, containing the count of each unique `num % x` and `num % y` for the corresponding `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of test cases, each containing a tuple (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a. It returns a list of results, where each result is the sum of the counts of remainders when each number in a is divided by x and y, as stored in dictionaries mod_x_map and mod_y_map.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `results` where each element is the sum of all values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for each `num` in the corresponding `arr` from the `test_cases` list. `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are dictionaries that have been updated for each tuple in `test_cases`, containing the count of each unique `num % x` and `num % y` for the corresponding `arr`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
