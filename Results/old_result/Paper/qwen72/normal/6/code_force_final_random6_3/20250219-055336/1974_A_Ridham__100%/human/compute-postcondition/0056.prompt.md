Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is an input integer; `result` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    space_x = x * 1
    space_y = y * 4
    total_space = space_y + space_x
    if y % 2 == 0:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2
    else:
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
    remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
    if space_x <= remaining_cells:
        result.append(screen_require_for_y)
    else:
        extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
        if extra_space % 15 == 0:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15
        else:
            extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
        result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`. If `y` is an even integer, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`. If `y` is an odd integer, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing the value `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing a single element which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15` is 0, otherwise `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, `screen_require_for_y` is the same as in the initial state, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list that now includes `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `extra_space` is equal to `x * 1 - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)`, `extra_screen` is equal to `(x * 1 - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)) // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0`, otherwise `extra_screen` is equal to `(x * 1 - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)) // 15 + 1`, and `result` is a list that now includes the value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x * 1`, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` if `y % 2 == 0` or `y // 2 + 1` if `y % 2 != 0`, `remaining_cells` is updated to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list that contains `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0` or `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space % 15 != 0`, and `result` is a list that includes the value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
