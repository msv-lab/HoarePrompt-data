Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` >= `find`, and `r` is `l` - 1.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has finished executing, the variable `l` will hold the smallest index in the `array` where the value at that index is greater than or equal to `find`. The variable `r` will be one less than `l`, indicating that the loop has narrowed down the search range to the point where no further iterations are needed. This means that the loop has effectively found the position where `find` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the `array`, or it has found the index of `find` if it exists in the `array`. If `find` is not in the `array`, `l` will point to the position where `find` would be inserted to keep the `array` sorted.
