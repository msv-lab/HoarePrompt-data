Output State: **`a` is an integer representing the first value input by the user, `b` is an integer representing the second value input by the user, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`.**

The code `t = t` does not change the value of `t`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and conditions.
