You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function `func_5` reads input values for integers `n` and `k` where \(1 \leq k < n \leq 10^5\), and `n-1` pairs of integers `u` and `v` representing the edges of a tree. It constructs a tree with `n` nodes and adds `n-1` edges to it. The tree is then rooted, and the function calls `func_4` with the tree, `n`, and `k` as arguments, printing the result of `func_4`. After the function concludes, the tree is fully constructed and rooted, and the result of `func_4` is printed.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a tree with `n` vertices and need to remove exactly `k` edges such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible value of `x`.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program consists of five functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5`.
   - `func_5` is the main function that reads input, constructs the tree, and prints the result.
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum `x`.
   - `func_3` checks if a given `x` is valid by using `func_1` or `func_2`.
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are helper functions to traverse the tree and count the number of good components and remaining sizes.

3. **Detailed Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function uses a stack to perform a depth-first search (DFS) in a non-recursive manner.
     - It calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for each vertex.
     - The function correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex based on its children.
   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function performs a recursive DFS.
     - It also calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for each vertex.
     - The function correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex based on its children.
   - **`func_3`**:
     - This function uses `func_1` to determine if a given `x` is valid.
     - It checks if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if it is exactly `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`.
     - The function correctly returns `True` if the conditions are met, otherwise `False`.
   - **`func_4`**:
     - This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the conditions.
     - It uses `func_3` to check the validity of the current midpoint `mid`.
     - The function correctly narrows down the search range and returns the maximum valid `x`.
   - **`func_5`**:
     - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and prints the result.
     - It correctly initializes the tree and adds edges.
     - It roots the tree and calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum `x`.

4. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, constructs the tree, and prints the result.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle edge cases such as a tree with a single vertex or a tree where `k` is close to `n-1`.
   - The binary search in `func_4` ensures that the maximum `x` is found efficiently.

6. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program's logic and structure align with the problem requirements.
   - The use of DFS and binary search is appropriate for the problem.
   - The functions correctly update and check the necessary conditions to determine the maximum `x`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and should solve the problem as described.
