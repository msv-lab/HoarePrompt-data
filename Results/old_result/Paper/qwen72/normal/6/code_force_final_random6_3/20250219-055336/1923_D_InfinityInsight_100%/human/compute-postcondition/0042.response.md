Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `i` is 2, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the corresponding element in `a` up to that index, `ans` remains a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except `ans[1]` which is set to `i + 1 - inx` and `ans[2]` which is set to 1, `left` is a list with `len(a) + 1` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to the corresponding index, `n` is greater than 2, `x` is `left[2] - a[2] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[0]`. If `last[0] < inx`, then `inx` is updated to `last[0]` and `inx2` is also `last[0]`. If `inx` is less than 0, the program continues to the next iteration or statement.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration or statement block and proceed to the next iteration or statement. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
