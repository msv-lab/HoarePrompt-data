Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment[0]` is `max_segment[0] + arr[2]`, `new_segment[0]` is `new_segment[0] + arr[2]`, `new_segment` and `segments_variants` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `new_segment[0]` is incremented by the value of `arr[2]`.
- The value of `max_segment[0]` is also incremented by the value of `arr[2]`, as stated in the initial condition.
- The values of `arr`, `i`, `max_sum`, `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` remain unchanged except for the specific updates to `new_segment[0]` and `max_segment[0]`.
