Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is equal to `l[x]`, `b` is infinity, `c` is 0, `x` is 0. If `a` > `b`, `a` is equal to `b`. The element at index `x` in `l` is greater than `a`, and `l[x]` is greater than `b`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is updated to be the element at index `x` in the list `l`.
- Since `x` is 0, `a` is now equal to `l[0]`.
- The conditions that `a` > `b` and `l[x]` > `b` are still valid, so `a` is greater than `b`, and `b` remains infinity.
- The other variables (`_`, `n`, `c`, `x`) and the precondition that `int(input())` must be greater than 0 remain unchanged.
