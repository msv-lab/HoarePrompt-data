The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `x`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than `x - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `x` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, `_` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be greater than 2.

State: **`x` is an integer between 3 and 2×10^5, `_` is 2, `a` and `b` are input integers, `lst[a]` is a list that now includes `b` as one of its elements (appears twice), `lst[b]` is a list that now includes `a` as one of its elements (appears three times)**
