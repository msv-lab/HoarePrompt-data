To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `ans` step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `s` is a list of integers derived from a new input string.
- `zeroes` is the number of zeros in `s`.
- `cnt` is a list where:
  - `cnt[0]` is the number of zeros in `s`.
  - `cnt[1]` is the number of ones in `s`.
- `ans` is calculated as follows:
  - The sum of the number of 0s in `s` for which there is at least one 1 before them.
  - Plus the sum of the number of 1s in `s` multiplied by the total number of 0s in `s` minus the number of 0s that have already been counted before each 1.

### Calculation of `ans`:
1. **Sum of the number of 0s in `s` for which there is at least one 1 before them:**
   - We need to iterate through the list `s` and count the number of 0s that appear after at least one 1.
   - This can be done by maintaining a counter for the number of 1s seen so far and adding the count of 0s to `ans` only if the counter for 1s is greater than 0.

2. **Sum of the number of 1s in `s` multiplied by the total number of 0s in `s` minus the number of 0s that have already been counted before each 1:**
   - For each 1 in the list `s`, we need to calculate the number of 0s that have not been counted yet (i.e., the total number of 0s minus the number of 0s counted before the current 1).
   - We then multiply this value by the number of 1s and add it to `ans`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example list `s = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]` to illustrate the calculation:

- `cnt[0]` (number of 0s) = 3
- `cnt[1]` (number of 1s) = 3

1. **First part of `ans`:**
   - Iterate through `s` and count 0s with at least one 1 before them:
     - `s[1] = 0` (1 before it) -> count 1
     - `s[3] = 0` (1 before it) -> count 1
     - `s[4] = 0` (1 before it) -> count 1
   - Total count for the first part = 3

2. **Second part of `ans`:**
   - For each 1 in `s`, calculate the number of 0s not counted yet and multiply by the number of 1s:
     - `s[0] = 1` (3 0s not counted yet) -> 3 * 3 = 9
     - `s[2] = 1` (2 0s not counted yet) -> 2 * 3 = 6
     - `s[5] = 1` (0 0s not counted yet) -> 0 * 3 = 0
   - Total count for the second part = 9 + 6 + 0 = 15

- **Final `ans` = 3 (first part) + 15 (second part) = 18**

### General Calculation:
- The first part of `ans` is the count of 0s that appear after at least one 1.
- The second part of `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s multiplied by the remaining 0s for each 1.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the calculated value of `ans` based on the given conditions. Since the exact list `s` is not provided, we can describe `ans` in terms of the given variables and conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the number of 0s in `s` for which there is at least one 1 before them, plus the sum of the number of 1s in `s` multiplied by the total number of 0s in `s` minus the number of 0s that have already been counted before each 1)**
