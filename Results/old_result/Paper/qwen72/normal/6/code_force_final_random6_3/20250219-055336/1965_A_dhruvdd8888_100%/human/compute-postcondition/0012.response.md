Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0, `ls` is now `nums[0] + nums[1] - nums[0]`, `i` is 2, `nums[0]` is the same as before, `len(nums)` is at least 2, `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - nums[0]`, and `nums[2]` is now `nums[2] - (nums[0] + nums[1] - nums[0])` which simplifies to `nums[2] - nums[1]`.**
