Reasoning:  
The program `func` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases `q` and for each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`). If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'. This matches the problem's requirements exactly.

The execution summary confirms that the program processes the input correctly and prints the appropriate output for each test case. The conditions for a stair and a peak are mutually exclusive, meaning that only one of the conditions can be true at a time, which is handled correctly by the program.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
