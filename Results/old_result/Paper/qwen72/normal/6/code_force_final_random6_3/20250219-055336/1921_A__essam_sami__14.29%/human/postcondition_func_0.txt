The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers (coordinates) from the user. It calculates the squared distances `n` and `x` between the first and third pairs, and the second and fourth pairs, respectively. It then compares these distances and prints the smaller of the two. After processing all test cases, the function ends, and the program state is such that `t` test cases have been processed, and the smaller squared distance for each test case has been printed.
