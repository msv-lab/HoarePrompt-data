Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `test` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. After processing each test case, it prints 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd. The function completes after processing all test cases. **
