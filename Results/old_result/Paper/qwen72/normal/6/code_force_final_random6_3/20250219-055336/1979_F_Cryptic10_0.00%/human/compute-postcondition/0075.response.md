Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 2`, `path` is a list that now includes `v` and at most one other vertex from the initial `remaining_vertices` set, `remaining_vertices` no longer contains `v` and has at least one vertex, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `n`, `d`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
