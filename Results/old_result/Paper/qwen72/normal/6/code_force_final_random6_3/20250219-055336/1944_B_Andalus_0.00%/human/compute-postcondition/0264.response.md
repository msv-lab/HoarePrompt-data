Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rdb` is an empty list, `rgt` is the list of elements in `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, `T` is unchanged, `_` is `n`, `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k` (or the total number of elements in `rdb` times 2, whichever is smaller) plus the number of elements printed from `sng` (which is 1 if `sng` contains an element, otherwise 0), `ldb` is the same as before, `sng` contains `lft[3]`, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before `sz` reached or exceeded `k` (or the last element in `sng` if `sz` never reaches or exceeds `k`).**
