Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to account for overlapping occurrences of the substrings "pie" and "map" that need to be removed. 

For example, consider the input string "pipie". The program will only remove the first "pie" and will not recognize the second "pie" that starts at the 3rd character. The correct output should be 2 (removing the 2nd and 4th characters), but the program will output 1.

Another example is the string "mmapmap". The program will remove the first "map" and then the second "map", but it will not recognize that the "map" substrings overlap. The correct output should be 3 (removing the 2nd, 5th, and 6th characters), but the program will output 2.

These examples show that the program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly, leading to incorrect results.
