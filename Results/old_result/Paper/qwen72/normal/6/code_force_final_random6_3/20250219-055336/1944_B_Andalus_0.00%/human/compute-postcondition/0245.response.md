Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sng` is a list containing elements from `lft` that are not equal to their immediate preceding and succeeding elements (if they exist), `ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is the smallest even number greater than or equal to `k` (or the total number of elements in `rdb` times 2, whichever is smaller) plus the number of elements printed from `sng` (which is an even number or `k` if `k` is reached first), `T`, `lst` is a list of integers input by the user, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rdb` is an empty list, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before `sz` reached or exceeded `k` (or the last element in `sng` if `sz` never reaches or exceeds `k`), `_` is `n`, `rgt` is the list of elements in `lst` starting from index `n` to the end.**

The code snippet `rdb = []` reassigns `rdb` to an empty list, but does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `rdb` is now explicitly an empty list.
