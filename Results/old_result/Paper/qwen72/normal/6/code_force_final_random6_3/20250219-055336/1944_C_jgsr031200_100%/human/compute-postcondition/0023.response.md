The code snippet `cou += 1` increments the value of `cou` by 1. The initial state specifies that `cou` is 1 if `freq[i]` is 1, otherwise `cou` remains 0. The current value of `freq[i]` is either 1 or greater than or equal to 2. If `freq[i]` is 1, `cou` will be incremented from 1 to 2. If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `cou` will be incremented from 0 to 1. The values of `arr`, `freq`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. `freq` is a list where each element at index `i` corresponds to the number of times the integer `i` appears in `arr`. `n` must be at least 0, and `i` is 1. If `freq[i]` is 1, `cou` is 2. If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `cou` is 1.**
