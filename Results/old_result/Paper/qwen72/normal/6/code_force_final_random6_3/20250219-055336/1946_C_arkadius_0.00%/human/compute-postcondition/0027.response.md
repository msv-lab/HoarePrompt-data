Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `v` is equal to `s`, `u` is the third child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`.**

Explanation: The value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is incremented by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`. The variables `tree`, `s`, `v`, and `u` retain their initial states, with `v` still equal to `s` and `u` still being the third child in `tree.vertices[v].children`.
