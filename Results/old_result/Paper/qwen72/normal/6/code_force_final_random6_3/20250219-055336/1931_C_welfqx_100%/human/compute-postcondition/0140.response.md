The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `j` must be less than `n - 1`.

State: **`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of `num` that are equal, up to `n - 1`, `cn` is increased by `ck` if `symb1` and `symb2` are equal, `r` is `t - 1`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 2, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is 2, `f` remains 1 if `num[j]` is equal to `num[j + 1]`**
