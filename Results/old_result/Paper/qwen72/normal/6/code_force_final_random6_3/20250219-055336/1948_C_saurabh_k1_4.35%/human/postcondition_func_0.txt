The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' or '>'. It then checks if the character at the second-to-last position in `b` is '<'. If it is, the function prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution without returning any value.
