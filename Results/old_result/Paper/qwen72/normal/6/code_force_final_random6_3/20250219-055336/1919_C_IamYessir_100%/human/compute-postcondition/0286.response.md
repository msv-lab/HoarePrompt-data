Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is `i + 1`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1, `y` retains its original value. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`.***
