Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n + 2`, `r[a[n] - 1]` retains its original value, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, and `ul` retains its original value.**

Explanation:
- The code `r[a[i] - 1] = 0` sets the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` to 0.
- The initial state specifies that `i` is `n + 2`, so `a[i]` is `a[n + 2]`.
- The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is changed to 0, regardless of the conditions involving `ul` and `ur`.
- The conditions for `ul` and `ur` do not affect the execution of the code, so `ul` retains its original value.
- The value of `n` and the expression `i = n + 2` remain unchanged.
- The value of `r[a[n] - 1]` also remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.
