Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0. If `x` > `y`, then: if `y` >= `lit[i]`, `b` is a list containing `lit[i]`, `x` is greater than the current value of `y`, and `y` is the last element of `b` which is `lit[i]`. If `y` < `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` > `x`, `a` is an empty list, `x` is infinity, `b` is a list containing `lit[i]`, and `y` is the last element of `b`, which is `lit[i]`. If `y` < `lit[i]` and `x` >= `lit[i]` > `y`, `a` is a list containing `lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[i]`), and `y` is the last element of `b` (if `b` is non-empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty). If none of these conditions are met, `x` remains greater than `y`, and `y` is less than `lit[i]`, with `lit[i]` being less than or equal to `x`. If `x` <= `y`, then: if `x` == `y`, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` < `y`, and `x` >= `lit[i]`, `a` is a list with `lit[i]` appended to it, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[i]`), and `y` is infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`, with `x` being less than `y`. If `x` < `y`, and `x` < `lit[i]` < `y`, `a` is a list containing `lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is `lit[i]`), `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, and `x` is less than `y`. If `x` < `y`, and `lit[i]` <= `y`, `b` is a non-empty list containing `lit[i]`, `x` is less than `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`. If `x` < `y`, and `lit[i]` is not greater than `y`, `x`, `y`, and `lit[i]` remain as they were, with `x` being less than `y` and `lit[i]` being between `x` and `y` (inclusive).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. If `x > y`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `b`, and `y` is updated to the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity. If `lit[i] > x`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `b`, and `y` is updated to the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is infinity. If `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `a`, and `x` is updated to the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is infinity. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is set to infinity. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to infinity. If `x <= y`, and `x == y`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `a`, `x` is set to the last element of `a` if `len(a) > 0`, otherwise `x` is set to infinity, `y` is set to the last element of `b` if `len(b) > 0`, otherwise `y` is set to infinity. If `x != y` and `x < y` and `x >= lit[i]`, or if `lit[i] > y`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `a`. If `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `b`. If `x >= y`, the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2. If the length of `lit` is 0, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`. If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x > y`: If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]`, then `b` is a list with the last element equal to `lit[2]`. If `lit[2]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list with the last element being `lit[2]`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a list containing `lit[2]`. If none of these conditions are met, `a` remains unchanged. If `x <= y`: If `x == y`, `a` is a list containing `lit[2]`. If `x < y`, then: if `x >= lit[2]`, `a` is a list that includes `lit[2]`. If `x < lit[2]` and `lit[2] > y`, `a` is a list that includes `lit[2]`. If `x < lit[2]` and `y >= lit[2]` and `lit[2] > x`, `b` is a list with the last element being `lit[2]`. If `x >= y`, there are no changes to `a` or `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
