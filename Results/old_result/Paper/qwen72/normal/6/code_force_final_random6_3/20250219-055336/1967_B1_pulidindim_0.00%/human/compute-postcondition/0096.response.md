Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the user, and calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 <= a <= n, 1 <= b <= m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). The function prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates. **
