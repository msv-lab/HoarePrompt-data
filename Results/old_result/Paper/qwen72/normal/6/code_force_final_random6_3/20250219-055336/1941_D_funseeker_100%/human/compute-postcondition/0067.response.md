Output State: **`n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a non-empty set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', or all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '?', `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is either '0', '1', or '?', `q` is the next element in the set `ans`, `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n` and any other values it already contained, if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '1', `temp` remains unchanged. Additionally, `temp` now contains the value `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation:
- The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
- `temp` was previously a set containing the value `(q + r) % n` and any other values it already contained, if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '1', `temp` remains unchanged.
- After executing the code, `temp` now contains the value `(q - r) % n` in addition to its previous contents.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
