Postcondition: ***`a` is a list with at least 4 elements, `b` is a list, `i` is 3, `s` is 1 if `a[0]` is greater than `a[1]`, otherwise `s` is 2 if `a[2]` is greater than `a[1]` and `a[3]` is not greater than `a[2]`, or `s` is 3 if `a[3]` is greater than `a[2]`. `n` is the input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, and `_` remains unchanged.***
