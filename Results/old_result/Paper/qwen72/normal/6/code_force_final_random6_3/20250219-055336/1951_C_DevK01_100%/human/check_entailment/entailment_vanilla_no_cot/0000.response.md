Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the minimum cost to purchase the tickets. Specifically, the program does not correctly account for the increase in ticket prices after purchasing tickets on a given day. Here's a detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Sorting the Prices**: The program sorts the list of ticket prices, which is a good start because it helps to minimize the cost by purchasing tickets on the cheapest days first.

2. **Calculating the Number of Days to Purchase**: The program calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`, which is the minimum number of days required to purchase `k` tickets. This is correct.

3. **Selecting the Cheapest Days**: The program selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` and stores them in `N`. This is also correct.

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If `n * m == k`, the program calculates the cost as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. This part is incorrect because it does not account for the price increases correctly.
   - If `n * m != k`, the program calculates the cost by popping the last element from `N`, calculating the cost for the remaining tickets, and then adding the cost for the tickets purchased on the last day. This part is also incorrect for the same reason.

The correct approach should involve:
- Purchasing tickets on the cheapest days first.
- Keeping track of the number of tickets purchased each day and adjusting the prices accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_cost_to_buy_tickets():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the prices in ascending order
        prices.sort()
        
        # Initialize the total cost
        total_cost = 0
        
        # Initialize the number of tickets to buy
        tickets_to_buy = k
        
        # Initialize the day counter
        day = 0
        
        while tickets_to_buy > 0:
            # Determine the number of tickets to buy on this day
            tickets_this_day = min(m, tickets_to_buy)
            
            # Calculate the cost for this day
            total_cost += tickets_this_day * (prices[day] + (tickets_to_buy - tickets_this_day))
            
            # Decrease the number of tickets to buy
            tickets_to_buy -= tickets_this_day
            
            # Move to the next day
            day += 1
        
        print(total_cost)

min_cost_to_buy_tickets()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case.
2. **Sorting the Prices**: The prices are sorted in ascending order to ensure that we buy tickets on the cheapest days first.
3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - We initialize `total_cost` to 0.
   - We use a while loop to keep buying tickets until `tickets_to_buy` is 0.
   - For each day, we determine the number of tickets to buy (`tickets_this_day`), which is the minimum of `m` and `tickets_to_buy`.
   - We calculate the cost for the tickets bought on this day, taking into account the price increase due to previous purchases.
   - We update `tickets_to_buy` by subtracting the number of tickets bought on this day.
   - We move to the next day by incrementing the `day` counter.
4. **Output**: The program prints the total cost for each test case.

This corrected program should correctly calculate the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets while adhering to the constraints and rules provided in the problem description.
