The function `sol` is expected to read input from stdin and write output to stdout. The input consists of multiple test cases, each starting with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile. The total number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is provided at the beginning of the input. The function should output the name of the winner ("Alice" or "Bob") for each test case, assuming both players play optimally.
