Output State: **`res` must contain all the elements that were processed and had `l[a[i] - 1]` equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `i` is the last element of `res` + 1, and `i` must be less than `2 * n`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `res`, `n`, `ul`, `ur`, and `i` remain unchanged, but the execution of the `break` statement causes us to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
