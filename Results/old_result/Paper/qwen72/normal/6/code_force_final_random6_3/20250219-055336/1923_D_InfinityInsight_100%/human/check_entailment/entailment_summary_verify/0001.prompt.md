You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

        else:
            last.append(last[-1])

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a list `a` of integers and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element is either -1 or a value calculated based on the conditions within the function. Specifically, for each index `i` in the list `a` (starting from 1 to `n-1`), if `a[i]` is not less than `a[i-1]` and the index of the last occurrence of `a[i-1]` (stored in `last`) is less than the index found by a function `func_1` applied to the cumulative sum list `left` and a calculated value `x`, then `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` remains -1.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a line of slimes, each with a specific size.
   - Each second, a slime can eat one of its neighbors if it is strictly larger than the neighbor.
   - We need to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten, or report -1 if it is impossible.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is used to find the index of the first element in a list `a` that is greater than or equal to a given value `x`.
   - `func_2` is the main function that processes the slimes and calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.

3. **Breaking Down `func_1`:**
   - `func_1(a, x)` uses `bisect_left` to find the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1.
   - If the element at the found index is exactly `x`, it returns `inx + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `inx`.

4. **Breaking Down `func_2`:**
   - `func_2(a, n)` processes the list `a` of size `n`.
   - It initializes `left` and `last` lists to keep track of cumulative sums and the last index of the same size slime, respectively.
   - It initializes `ans` with -1 for all slimes, indicating that initially, no slime is eaten.
   - It iterates through the slimes:
     - If the current slime `a[i]` is smaller than the previous slime `a[i - 1]`, it sets `ans[i]` to 1, meaning the current slime can be eaten by the previous slime in one second.
     - Otherwise, it calculates `x` as the cumulative sum of slimes up to `i` minus the size of the current slime minus 1.
     - It uses `func_1` to find the index `inx` of the first cumulative sum that is greater than or equal to `x`.
     - It also finds `inx2` as the last index of the same size slime before `i`.
     - If `inx2` is less than `inx`, it updates `inx` to `inx2`.
     - If `inx` is less than 0, it continues to the next iteration.
     - Otherwise, it sets `ans[i]` to `i + 1 - inx`, which is the minimum number of seconds it takes for the current slime to be eaten.

5. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where a slime is smaller than its previous neighbor.
   - The cumulative sum and the last index of the same size slime are used to determine the minimum number of seconds for a slime to be eaten.
   - The use of `bisect_left` ensures efficient searching for the cumulative sum.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle cases where no slime can be eaten (e.g., all slimes are the same size).
   - It should also handle cases where the slimes are in a configuration that prevents some slimes from being eaten.

7. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program seems to correctly implement the logic for determining the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.
   - The use of cumulative sums and the `bisect_left` function is appropriate for the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the logic implemented. It correctly handles the given constraints and edge cases.
