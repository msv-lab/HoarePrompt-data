Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `s` contains all its original characters with leading and trailing spaces removed.
2. `a` contains all unique characters from `s`.
3. `i` has iterated through each character in `s`.
4. The length of `a` is greater than 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides information about the variables `s`, `a`, and `i`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
- The condition that the length of `a` is greater than 1 is given, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `s`, `a`, or `i`.

Output: **YES**
