Output State: **`i` remains `n - 1`, `n` remains greater than or equal to 1, `rdb` remains unchanged, `sz` remains `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + 1`, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(rdb))` elements of `rdb` twice each, if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop has been exited, if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then the loop has printed additional elements up to `k` times, `sng` must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
