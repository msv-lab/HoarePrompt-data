Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment[0]` is `max_segment[0] + arr[1]`, `new_segment` is `[arr[2], 2]`, `segments_variants` is updated based on the conditions described.**

Explanation:
- `arr` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains 2.
- `max_sum` remains -1.
- `max_segment[0]` is still `max_segment[0] + arr[1]`.
- `new_segment` is now `[arr[2], 2]` because the code assigns `[arr[i], i]` to `new_segment`, and `i` is 2.
- `segments_variants` is updated based on the conditions described, but the specific details of this update are not provided in the code snippet. Therefore, it is mentioned that it is updated based on the conditions described.
