Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the third tuple and must have at least `len(arr)` elements, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the value of `count` has been appended to it, `count` is now the sum of all values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for each `num` in `arr`, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the result of `-num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y` is the result of `num % y` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is the result of `num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is the result of `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The code `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the list `results`.
- The value of `count` is the sum of all values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for each `num` in `arr`.
- All other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `mod_x_key`, `mod_y_key`) remain unchanged.
- The list `results` now contains the final value of `count` and the value of `count` has been appended to it.
