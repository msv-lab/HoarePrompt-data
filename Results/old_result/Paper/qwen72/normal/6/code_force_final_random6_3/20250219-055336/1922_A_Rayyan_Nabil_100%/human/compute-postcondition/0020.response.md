Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `a` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `results` is a list that includes the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` `t` times.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` must have been greater than or equal to the total number of iterations.
- The loop counter `_` will be `t-1`, indicating the last iteration.
- The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will have their final values from the last iteration, with `n` being an integer and `a`, `b`, and `c` being strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- The list `results` will contain the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each of the `t` iterations.
