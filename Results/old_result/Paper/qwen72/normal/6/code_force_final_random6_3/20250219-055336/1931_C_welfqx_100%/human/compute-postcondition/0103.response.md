The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 to ensure `i` is less than `n - 1`.

State: **`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `r` is `t`, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is the index where the first pair of consecutive elements that are not equal was found if the loop does not complete all iterations, otherwise `j` is `n - 2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is 2, and `cn` is 2 if `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, otherwise `cn` is 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
