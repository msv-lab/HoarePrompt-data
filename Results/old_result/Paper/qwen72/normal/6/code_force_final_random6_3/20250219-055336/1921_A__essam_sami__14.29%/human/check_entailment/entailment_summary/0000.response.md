Reasoning:  
The program is intended to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. However, the approach used in the program to calculate the area is flawed. The program calculates the squared distances between specific pairs of points (first and third, second and fourth) and then prints the smaller of these two squared distances. This method does not guarantee that the correct side length of the square is being used to calculate the area.

For a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by finding the absolute difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent corners. The area of the square is then the side length squared.

The program should:
1. Identify the side length of the square by finding the absolute difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent corners.
2. Compute the area by squaring the side length.
3. Print the area for each test case.

The current implementation does not correctly identify the side length of the square, and thus, it may produce incorrect results.

For example, in the first test case:
- Coordinates: (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2)
- The side length of the square is 3 (both in the x and y directions).
- The correct area is \(3^2 = 9\).

However, the program calculates the squared distances between (1, 2) and (1, 5) (which is 9) and between (4, 5) and (4, 2) (which is also 9), and prints 9, which is correct in this case but not guaranteed to be correct for all cases.

In the second test case:
- Coordinates: (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)
- The side length of the square is 2 (both in the x and y directions).
- The correct area is \(2^2 = 4\).

The program calculates the squared distances between (-1, 1) and (1, 1) (which is 4) and between (1, -1) and (-1, -1) (which is also 4), and prints 4, which is correct in this case but not guaranteed to be correct for all cases.

In the third test case:
- Coordinates: (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39)
- The side length of the square is 28 (both in the x and y directions).
- The correct area is \(28^2 = 784\).

The program calculates the squared distances between (45, 11) and (17, 11) (which is 784) and between (45, 39) and (17, 39) (which is also 784), and prints 784, which is correct in this case but not guaranteed to be correct for all cases.

However, the program's logic is not robust enough to handle all possible configurations of the square's corners, and it may fail in cases where the chosen pairs do not represent the side length of the square.

Correctness: **False**
