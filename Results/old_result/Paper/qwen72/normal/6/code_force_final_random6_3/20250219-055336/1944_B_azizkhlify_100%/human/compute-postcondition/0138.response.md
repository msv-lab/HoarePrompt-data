Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `res` is an empty list.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `l` is a list of `n` integers.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element `r[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by the number of times `a[j]` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`.
- `re` is 0.
- `ul` is 0.
- `ur` is 0.
- If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `l[a[1] - 1]` is set to 0 and `ul` is set to 2.
- If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ul` remains 2. Otherwise, `ul` remains 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is 1.
2. **Value of `a[i]`**: Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` is the second element of the list `a`.
3. **Print Statement**: The `print` statement prints `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Determining the Output:
- The value of `a[i]` is the second element of the list `a`.
- The `print` statement will print this value twice, followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **[a[1]] [a[1]] (where [a[1]] is the second element of the list `a`)**

This output will be printed to the console, where `[a[1]]` is the value of the second element in the list `a`.
