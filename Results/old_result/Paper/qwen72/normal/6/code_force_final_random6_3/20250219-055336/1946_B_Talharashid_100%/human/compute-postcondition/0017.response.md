Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`, `c` is `c + ele`, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and its previous value.
- If `ele` < 0 and `c` <= `abs(ele)`, then `c` remains 0, and `maxi` remains 0.
- Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele`, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and 0.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged.
