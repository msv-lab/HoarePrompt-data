To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `tc` is 1.
   - `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with default integer values and now contains the count of each integer in the list `a`.
   - `t` is 2 if `cnt[i]` is 1, otherwise `t` remains 1.
   - `a` is a new list of integers input by the user.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - Otherwise, the program continues normally.

3. **Value of `i`:**
   - The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2.

4. **Value of `t`:**
   - The value of `t` depends on `cnt[i]`. If `cnt[i]` (which is `cnt[2]` since `i` is 2) is 1, then `t` is 2. Otherwise, `t` remains 1.

5. **Break Condition:**
   - We break out of the loop or if statement if `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0.
   - Since `i` is 2, we need to check `cnt[2]` and `t`:
     - If `cnt[2]` is 1, then `t` is 2.
     - If `t` is 2, the break condition is met, and the loop or if statement is exited.
     - If `cnt[2]` is 0, the break condition is also met, and the loop or if statement is exited.
     - If `cnt[2]` is not 1 and not 0, then `t` remains 1, and the break condition is not met.

6. **Output:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 2, regardless of the break condition.

Therefore, the output of the `print(i)` statement will be:

Output: **2**
