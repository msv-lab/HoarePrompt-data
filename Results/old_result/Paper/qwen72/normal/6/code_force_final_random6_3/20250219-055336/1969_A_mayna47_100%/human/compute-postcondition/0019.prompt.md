You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, each test case consists of n (2 <= n <= 50) and a list p of n integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements initialized to the input values, `i` is `n`. If `v[v[i]]` is equal to `i` for any `i` in the range 1 to `n`, the program prints 2 and returns. Otherwise, the program returns nothing.
    print(3)
    #This is printed: - The code will execute the `else` block and print `3`.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an implicit set of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list `p` of `n` integers where each `p_i` is between 1 and `n`, `p_i` ≠ i, and all `p_i` are distinct. The function performs operations on these inputs but does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing.

Case_2: The program returns nothing.

Case_3: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
