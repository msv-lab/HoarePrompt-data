Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. `freq` is a list where each element at index `i` corresponds to the number of times the integer `i` appears in `arr`. `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, and `cou` remains 1. If `freq[2]` is 1, `cou` is updated to 2. If `freq[2]` is greater than or equal to 2, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement after the loop. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes.***
