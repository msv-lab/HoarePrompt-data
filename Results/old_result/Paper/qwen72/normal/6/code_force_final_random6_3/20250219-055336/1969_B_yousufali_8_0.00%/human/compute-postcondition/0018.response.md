The code snippet `ans += n + 1` increments the value of `ans` by `n + 1`. The value of `n` is determined by the condition `s[i]`. If `s[i]` is 1, `n` is increased by 1; otherwise, `n` remains unchanged. The value of `i` is 2, so we check `s[2]` to determine the value of `n`.

- If `s[2]` is 1, `n` is increased by 1.
- If `s[2]` is 0, `n` remains unchanged.

In both cases, `ans` is incremented by `n + 1`.

Output State: **`s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with a length of at least 3 and at most 200,000, `i` is 2, `n` is increased by 1 if `s[2]` is 1, otherwise `n` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by `n + 1`.**
