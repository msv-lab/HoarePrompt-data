Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the number of tickets to be purchased (`k`) is greater than the product of the number of days (`n`) and the maximum tickets that can be purchased per day (`m`). This is a valid scenario according to the problem constraints, but the program does not account for it.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3 2 7
1 2 3
```
Here, `n = 3`, `m = 2`, and `k = 7`. The program should determine the minimum cost to buy 7 tickets, but the current logic does not handle this case correctly. The program will attempt to sort the prices and then calculate the cost, but it will not correctly account for the fact that you need to buy more tickets than the maximum allowed per day over the given number of days.

The program should handle this edge case by ensuring that it correctly calculates the cost for purchasing the required number of tickets, even if it means buying more than the maximum allowed per day over multiple days.
