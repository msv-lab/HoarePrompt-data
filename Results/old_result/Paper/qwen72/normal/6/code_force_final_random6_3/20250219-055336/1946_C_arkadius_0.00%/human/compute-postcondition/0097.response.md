The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `tree`, `s`, and `x`. `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), and `x` is a non-negative integer. The function returns two values: `good_components` and `remaining_size`. `good_components` is the sum of the `good_components` of all its children plus the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `remaining_size` is the sum of the `remaining_size` of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.
