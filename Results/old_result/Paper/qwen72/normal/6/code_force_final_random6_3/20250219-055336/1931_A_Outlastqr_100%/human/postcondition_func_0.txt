The function `func` reads a series of integers from the user, where each integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) represents the encoded sum of the positions of three lowercase Latin letters. For each integer `n`, the function prints a corresponding three-letter word based on the following rules: If `n` > 52, the word is the character at index `n - 53` in the alphabet followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), the word is 'a' followed by the character at index `n - 28` in the alphabet, followed by 'z'. If `n` is 27, the word is 'aay'. If `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), the word is 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3` in the alphabet. The function does not return any value but prints the resulting word for each input integer.
