Output State: **`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of `num` that are equal, up to `n - 1`, `cn` is increased by `ck` if `symb1` and `symb2` are equal, `r` is `t - 1`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1 if all elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is `n - 2`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `ii` remains `n - 2` as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `ck` remains the number of consecutive elements from the end of `num` that are equal, up to `n - 1`.
- The variable `cn` is increased by `ck` if `symb1` and `symb2` are equal, but this is not affected by the loop itself.
- The variable `r` remains `t - 1` as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `t` remains greater than `t - 1` as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains the input integer as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `f` will be 1 if all elements in `num` are equal. If any two consecutive elements in `num` are not equal, `f` will be set to 0 and the loop will break.
- The variable `num` remains the list of integers provided by the user.
- The variable `j` will be `n - 2` after the loop completes, assuming `n` is greater than 1. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute, and `j` remains undefined. If the loop breaks early, `j` will be the index at which the inequality was found.
