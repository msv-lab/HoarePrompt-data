### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing one coin from their current wallet.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet before removing a coin.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin from a non-empty wallet) loses.

2. **Optimal Play:**
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best move available to them.
   - The key to determining the winner is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins \(a + b\).

3. **Parity Analysis:**
   - If the total number of coins \(a + b\) is even, the game will end in a situation where both wallets are empty at the same time.
   - If the total number of coins \(a + b\) is odd, one player will always have one more coin than the other, and the player with the extra coin will be able to make the last move.

4. **Game Dynamics:**
   - If \(a + b\) is even, the number of moves each player can make is the same. Since Alice starts, Bob will make the last move, and Alice will be unable to make a move after that, resulting in Bob's win.
   - If \(a + b\) is odd, the number of moves each player can make is different. Alice will always have the advantage of making the last move, resulting in Alice's win.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins \(a\) and \(b\) in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - It checks if the sum \(a + b\) is even by using the bitwise AND operator `&` with 1. If the result is 0, the sum is even, and Bob wins. Otherwise, the sum is odd, and Alice wins.
   - The program correctly implements the logic based on the parity of \(a + b\).

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code confirms that the program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case correctly.
   - The annotated code also confirms that the program checks the parity of \(a + b\) using the bitwise AND operator `&` with 1.
   - The annotations indicate that the program prints 'Bob' if the sum is even and 'Alice' if the sum is odd, which aligns with the optimal play analysis.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its implementation and logic. It correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
