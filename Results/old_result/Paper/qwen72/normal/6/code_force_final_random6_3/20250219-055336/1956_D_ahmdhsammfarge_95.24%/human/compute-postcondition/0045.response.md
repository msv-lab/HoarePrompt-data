The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `lst`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the length of `lst`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, `i` is 2, and `lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 < n <= 18`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `len(lst)`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `j` will be 4 in the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `len(lst)` must be greater than 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `2 < n <= 18`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` from index 0 to 1 and from index 4 to `n-1` plus 4, `r` is 1, `l` is the value of `j` where the maximum `sm` was found, and `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during all iterations of the loop. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `r` is 2, `l` is 3, and `over_sum` is updated to the value of `sm`. Otherwise, `r` remains 1 and `over_sum` remains unchanged.**
