The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has more elements, the loop will continue to the next element. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first element in `a`, and `a` must be a non-empty list. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still be a non-empty list, and `i` must now be the second element in `a`.

State: **`a` must be a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `a`, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the corresponding element in `a` up to that index, `ans` remains a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, `left` is a list with an additional element appended, which is the sum of the last element in `left` and the first element in `a`.**
