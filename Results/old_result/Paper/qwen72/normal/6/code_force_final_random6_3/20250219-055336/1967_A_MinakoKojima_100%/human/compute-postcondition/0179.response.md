Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans_list` contains `a[0]` and `a[0]`, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `dif` is the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]`. If `k` is 0, `k`, `ans`, and `res` remain unchanged, and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is `a[0] + dif`, `k` is `k - dif * 2`, and `res` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the initial condition. If `dif` is 0, `ans` is `a[0]` plus `k` divided by 2 (integer division), `k` is 0, and `res` is `n - 2 + k % 2`. If `dif` is not 0, `ans` is `a[0]` plus `k` divided by 2 (integer division), `k` is 0, and `res` is `n - 1 + k % 2` or `n - 2 + k % 2` depending on the initial condition.***
