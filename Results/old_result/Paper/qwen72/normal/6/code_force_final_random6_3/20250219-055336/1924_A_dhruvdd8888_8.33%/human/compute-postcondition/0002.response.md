The code snippet creates a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The set is generated by iterating over a range from 0 to `k-1` and converting each integer to its corresponding character using `chr(i + 97)`. The initial state specifies that `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 26, so `us` will contain between 1 and 26 unique characters, starting from 'a' and ending at the `k`-th character in the alphabet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5. For each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, and `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**
