The function reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` is the length of the array and `k` is the number of sorted cyclic shifts required. The function then prints a list of `n` integers: a list of `n` ones if `k == n`, a range from 0 to `n-1` if `k == 1`, or a list containing `-1` if neither condition is met. The function does not return any value.
