Postcondition: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 0, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, and `c` is 0. If `a` > `b`, then `a` is equal to `b` and `b` is equal to `a`. The first element of `l` (i.e., `l[x]`) is greater than `a`. Additionally, the first element of `l` (i.e., `l[x]`) is less than or equal to `b`.**
