Output State: **`arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing three elements which are `1 << i`, `1 << i`, and `k0 - (1 << i) - (1 << i)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
