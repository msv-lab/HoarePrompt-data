Precondition: **The function `func_1` is incorrectly defined as it does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(s: str) -> int:` where `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) consisting only of characters "+" and "-", and the function returns an integer representing the minimum possible penalty.**
