The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers where the length of the list is between 1 and 200,000, and each integer in the list is between 1 and the length of the list.

- **Case_1**: The function returns 0.
- **Case_2**: The function returns the difference between `j` and `i`, plus 1, where `i` and `j` are indices in the list.
- **Case_3**: The function returns the difference between `j` and `i`, where `j` is the last index of the list (`len(arr) - 1`) and `i` is the index where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or `i` is the last index of the list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns different values based on the content of the list: it returns 0 in Case_1, the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1 in Case_2, and the difference between `j` and `i` where `j` is the last index of the list and `i` is the index where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or `i` is the last index in Case_3.**
