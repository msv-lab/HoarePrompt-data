Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `lit`. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`.**
