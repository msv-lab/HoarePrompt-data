The code `info = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings based on spaces. This list is then assigned to the variable `info`. The values of `n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `suma` are not directly affected by this code, but the new value of `info` will be used to update `a` and `b` in subsequent code.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info`, `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated in the loop, where `x` is \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\right)\) for \(i\) from 1 to `b`, and an additional 1 is added to `suma` for each `i` where \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\)**
