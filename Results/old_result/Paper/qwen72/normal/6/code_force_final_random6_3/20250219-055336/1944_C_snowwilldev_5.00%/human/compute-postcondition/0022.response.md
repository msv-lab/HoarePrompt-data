Postcondition: ***`N` is the input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `tc` is 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and contains the count of each integer in the list `a` up to index `N-1`. If the count of the integer at index `i` in the list `a` is 1, then `t` is 1. Otherwise, `t` remains 0.***
