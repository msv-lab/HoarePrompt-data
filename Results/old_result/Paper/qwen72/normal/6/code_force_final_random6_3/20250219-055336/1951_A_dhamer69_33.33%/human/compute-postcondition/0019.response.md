Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2, `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`, and `count_1` is even. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', then this condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the number of occurrences of '11' in `s` is not equal to 1.***
