Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 676, inclusive.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` is a fixed string containing all lowercase English letters.
   - The slice `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]` will take the first `k` characters from this string.
   - The expression `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n` will repeat the sliced string `n` times.
   - The `print` statement will output this repeated string.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The value of `k` determines the length of the substring taken from `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`.
   - The value of `n` determines how many times this substring is repeated.

Given the initial state, the output will be the first `k` characters of the alphabet string repeated `n` times.

Output: **'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n (where 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] is the first k characters of the alphabet string, and n is the input integer)**
