Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum value between the original `pergunta` and the sum of `x` and `a[i]` for all `i` where `i < m`. `x` is the sum of the minimum values between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`. `i` is `-1`. The lists `a` and `b`, and the integers `n` and `m` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, this means:
- After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `pergunta` will be the minimum value it had initially or any value of `x + a[i]` where `i` is less than `m` during the loop's execution.
- The value of `x` will be the sum of the minimum values between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all indices `i` from `n-1` down to `0`.
- The loop index `i` will be `-1` because the loop runs from `n-1` down to `0`.
- The lists `a` and `b`, and the integers `n` and `m` will remain the same as they were in the initial state.
