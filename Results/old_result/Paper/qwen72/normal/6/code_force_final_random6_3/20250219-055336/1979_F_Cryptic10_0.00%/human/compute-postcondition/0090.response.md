Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^5) representing the number of vertices in a graph. It constructs a path that includes all vertices from 1 to `n` and prints this path in the format "! 1 2 3 ... n". After the function concludes, `path` contains all vertices from 1 to `n` in some order, and `remaining_vertices` is an empty set. The function does not return any value. **
