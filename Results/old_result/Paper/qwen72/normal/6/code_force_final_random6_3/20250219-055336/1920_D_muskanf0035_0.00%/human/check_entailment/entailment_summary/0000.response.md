Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads `n` lines of operations and `q` integers for queries, storing them appropriately.

2. **Operation Handling**:
   - `func_1` processes the operations as described:
     - For operation type 1, it appends the value to the array.
     - For operation type 2, it duplicates the current array `x` times.
   - However, the implementation of operation type 2 in `func_1` is incorrect. It should duplicate the array `x` times, but the current implementation only duplicates the array once.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - After processing all operations, `func_1` constructs the result by accessing the array at the indices specified by the queries.
   - The use of `(k - 1) % len(array)` ensures that the queries are handled correctly even if the array is very large, as it effectively reduces the query index modulo the length of the array.

4. **Output**:
   - `func_2` prints the results of each test case as required.

Given the incorrect implementation of operation type 2 in `func_1`, the program will not correctly handle the duplication of the array multiple times, leading to incorrect results for test cases with operation type 2.

Correctness: **False**
