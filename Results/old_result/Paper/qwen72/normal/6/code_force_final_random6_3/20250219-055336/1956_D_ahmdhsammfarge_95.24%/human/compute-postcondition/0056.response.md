Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `1 <= n <= 18`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `n`, `r` is the value of `i` where the maximum `sm` was found, `l` is the value of `j` where the maximum `sm` was found, and `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during all iterations of the loop.**

### Explanation:
- **`lst`**: The list `lst` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop has completed all iterations, `i` will be `n-1` because the outer loop runs from `0` to `n-1` (inclusive).
- **`j`**: After the loop has completed all iterations, `j` will be `n` because the inner loop runs from `i+1` to `n-1` (inclusive), and when `i` is `n-1`, the inner loop does not execute, leaving `j` at `n`.
- **`r` and `l`**: These variables store the indices `i` and `j` where the maximum value of `sm` was found. The loop updates `r` and `l` whenever a new maximum `sm` is found.
- **`over_sum`**: This variable stores the maximum value of `sm` found during all iterations of the loop. The loop updates `over_sum` whenever a new maximum `sm` is found.

The loop iterates through all possible pairs of indices `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < j < n`, calculating the sum `sm` for each pair and updating `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` if a new maximum `sm` is found. After all iterations, `r` and `l` will hold the indices that gave the maximum `sm`, and `over_sum` will hold the maximum value of `sm`.
