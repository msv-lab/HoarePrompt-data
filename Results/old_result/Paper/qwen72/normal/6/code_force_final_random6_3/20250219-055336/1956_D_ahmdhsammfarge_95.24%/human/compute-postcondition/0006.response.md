The code snippet `ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])` appends a new sublist `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the list `ops`. This does not affect the values of `r`, `l`, or `lst`. The condition regarding the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers, and `ops` now includes an additional list `[r + 1, l + 1]` in addition to the previously mentioned `[r + 1, r + 1]`. The function `func_2` has been called with arguments `r`, `l`, and `ops`. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.**
