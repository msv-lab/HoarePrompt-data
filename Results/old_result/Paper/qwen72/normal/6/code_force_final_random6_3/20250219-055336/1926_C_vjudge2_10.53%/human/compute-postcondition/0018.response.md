Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except `values[0]` which is 0, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 0, `i` is 0, `sum_values[0]` is 0.** 

The code snippet `sum_values[i] = total` assigns the value of `total` (which is 0) to the first element of the `sum_values` list (index 0). The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
