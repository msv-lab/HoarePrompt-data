Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x != y, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

Explanation: The provided code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n` and `m` to the input integers. Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, this condition is still valid after the code execution. The values of `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is recalculated as the absolute difference between the new values of `n` and `m`. The rest of the conditions in the initial state remain valid.
