### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Single Integer Case (`n == 1`):**
   - If `n` is 1, the program simply prints `k`. This is correct because the only way to satisfy the conditions with a single integer is to output `k` itself, and the number of 1s in the binary representation of `k` is already maximized.

3. **Multiple Integers Case (`n > 1`):**
   - The program calls `func_1(k)` to determine the highest bit position that is set in the binary representation of `k`.
   - It then appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the array `arr`. This value is the largest number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position determined by `func_1(k)`.
   - The program appends `k - arr[-1]` to the array `arr`. This ensures that the sum of the first two elements in `arr` is equal to `k`.
   - The remaining elements of `arr` are filled with 0s to ensure the array has `n` elements.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` correctly returns the highest bit position that is set in the binary representation of `n` minus one. This is done by right-shifting `n` until it becomes 0 and counting the number of shifts.
   - The function returns `-1` if `n` is 0, but this case is not relevant because `k` is guaranteed to be at least 1.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `arr` for each test case, ensuring that the sum of the elements is `k` and the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the elements is maximized.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the single integer case.
- For the multiple integers case, it ensures the sum of the elements is `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the elements.
- The function `func_1` correctly determines the highest bit position that is set in the binary representation of `k`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
