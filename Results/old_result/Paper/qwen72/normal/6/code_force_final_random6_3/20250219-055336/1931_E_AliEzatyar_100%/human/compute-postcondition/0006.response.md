Postcondition: ***`num` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9, and the length of `num` is an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `m` is an integer (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6), `i` is `len(num) - 1`. If the last element of `num` (i.e., `num[i]`) is '0', `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, `counter` remains 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
