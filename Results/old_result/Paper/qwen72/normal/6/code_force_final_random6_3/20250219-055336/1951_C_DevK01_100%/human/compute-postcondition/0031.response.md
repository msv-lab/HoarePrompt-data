Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is not explicitly set before the loop but will be assigned the next value in the range (0 to `t-1`), `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `n` is now the length of `N`, `m` is now the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is now `L[2]`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `cost` is calculated as described, and `w` and `mu` are set if `n * m` is not equal to `k`.**

Explanation:
- `w` is assigned the value of the last element of `N` using `N.pop()`.
- The last element is removed from `N`, so `N` now contains the first `q-1` elements of `M`.
- All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
