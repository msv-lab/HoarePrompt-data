Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `stack` is empty. For each vertex `v` in the tree, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of `good_components` of all its children plus the number of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. Additionally, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of the `remaining_size` of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. The initial variables `tree`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, after the loop has finished executing, the `stack` is empty, meaning all vertices have been processed. Each vertex `v` in the tree has its `good_components` attribute updated to reflect the total number of "good" components in its subtree, where a "good" component is defined as a child vertex whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. The `remaining_size` attribute of each vertex `v` is updated to the sum of the `remaining_size` of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. The initial state of the tree, the starting vertex `s`, and the non-negative integer `x` remain unchanged.
