Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `bets` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `bets - 1`.
   - `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to `bets - 1`.
   - `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the updated list `a`.
   - `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`.
   - `ans` is a string containing the values of `str(a[0])`, `str(a[1])`, ..., `str(a[bets-1])` each followed by a space.
   - The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the integer `-1`.
   - The initial state provides a lot of information about the variables and their relationships, but the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables. It is a straightforward print of a constant value.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
