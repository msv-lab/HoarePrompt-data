The only objects in the loop head are the variable `segment` and the list `segments_variants`. The loop will execute one more time if there is at least one more element in `segments_variants` to be assigned to `segment`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers with at least `len(arr)` elements.
- `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `max_sum` is -1.
- `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the sum of the last segment of positive integers and its starting index.
- `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of positive integers found and its starting index.
- `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a segment of positive integers, its starting index, and its ending index, and `segments_variants` must have at least one element.

For the loop to execute one more time, `segments_variants` must have at least one more element. Since `segments_variants` must have at least one element at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `segments_variants` must have at least two elements. The variable `segment` will be updated to the next element in `segments_variants`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least `len(arr)` elements, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the sum of the last segment of positive integers and its starting index, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of positive integers found and its starting index, `segments_variants` must have at least 2 elements, `segment` is the second element in `segments_variants`**
