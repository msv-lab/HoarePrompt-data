Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `i` is 3, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the corresponding element in `a` up to that index, `ans` remains a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except `ans[1]` which is set to `i + 1 - inx2`, `ans[2]` which is set to `i + 1 - inx2`, and if `a[3] < a[2]`, `ans[3]` is set to 1. `left` is a list with `len(a) + 1` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to the corresponding index, `n` is greater than 3, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx` is `last[2]`, `inx2` is `last[2]`.**
