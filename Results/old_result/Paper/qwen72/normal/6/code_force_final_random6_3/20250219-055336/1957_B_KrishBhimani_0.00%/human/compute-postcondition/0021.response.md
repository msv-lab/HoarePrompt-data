Output State: **`n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1` right-shifted by 3 bits and must be non-zero, `k0` is the second integer from `l1` and must be greater than 3, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3. If the original `k` was odd, `arr` is `[1, 2]`. If the original `k` was even, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]`.**
