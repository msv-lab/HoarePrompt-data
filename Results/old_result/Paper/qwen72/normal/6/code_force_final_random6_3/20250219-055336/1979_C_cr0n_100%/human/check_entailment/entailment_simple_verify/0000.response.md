### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the original assessment step by step.

1. **Function 1:**
   ```python
   def func_1(a, b):
       return a * b // gcd(a, b)
   ```
   This function correctly computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). The LCM is used to find a common multiple of all the multipliers \(k_i\).

2. **Function 2:**
   ```python
   def func_2():
       N = int(input().strip())
       vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
       den = vals[0]
       for x in vals:
           den = func_1(den, x)
       vprod = [(den // r) for r in vals]
       den = den - sum(vprod)
       if den <= 0:
           print(-1)
           return
       print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
   ```

   - **Input Handling:**
     - \(N\) is read as an integer, and \(vals\) is a list of \(N\) integers.
     - The initial value of `den` is set to the first element of \(vals\).

   - **LCM Calculation:**
     - The program iterates through the list `vals` and updates `den` to be the LCM of `den` and each element \(x\) in `vals`.
     - This ensures that `den` is the LCM of all the multipliers \(k_i\).

   - **Bet Calculation:**
     - `vprod` is a list where each element is the integer division of `den` by the corresponding element in `vals`.
     - `den` is then updated to be `den - sum(vprod)`.

   - **Output:**
     - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints \(-1\) and returns.
     - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string.

3. **Annotated Code:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The LCM calculation ensures that `den` is a common multiple of all \(k_i\).
   - The bet calculation ensures that each bet \(x_i\) is `den // k_i`.
   - The final check `if den <= 0` ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.

4. **Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the program does not correctly handle the case where all multipliers \(k_i\) are the same.
   - For the test case:
     ```
     2
     5
     5 5 5 5 5
     ```
     - The program computes `den` as the LCM of all 5s, which is 5.
     - `vprod` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` because \(5 // 5 = 1\).
     - `den` is then updated to \(5 - (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 0\).
     - Since `den` is 0, the program prints \(-1\), which is the correct output because it is impossible to distribute the coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is incorrect. The program does handle the case where all multipliers \(k_i\) are the same correctly. It correctly identifies that it is impossible to distribute the coins in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome and prints \(-1\).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
