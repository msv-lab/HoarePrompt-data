Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `v` is the value of the first element popped from `stack`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have been fully iterated over, `stack` now contains tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v` appended to it in the order they were iterated.**

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the `tree` object remains unchanged. The variable `v` still holds the value of the first element popped from `stack`. The loop has iterated over all the children of the vertex `v` in the `tree`. For each child `u` of `v`, the tuple `(u, False)` has been appended to the `stack` in the order they were encountered. The `stack` now contains these tuples, and the last element of the `stack` is `(v, True)`, as specified in the initial state.
