The function `func` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples. Each tuple contains two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates are within the range -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and the square has a positive area with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines whether the given coordinates form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. If they do, the function returns "Valid Square" for that test case; otherwise, it returns "Invalid Square".

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, each containing four tuples of integer coordinates representing the corners of a square. It returns a list of results, where each result is "Valid Square" if the coordinates form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, or "Invalid Square" otherwise.**
