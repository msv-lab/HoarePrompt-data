Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the generation of a permutation that meets the specified conditions for all potential cases. Specifically, the permutation generated by the program can still have elements where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` for some indices `i` and `j`.

For example, consider the input `n = 4`. The program generates the permutation `[4, 1, 2, 3]`. However, this permutation is not valid because for `i = 1` and `j = 3`, `p_1 = 4` divides `p_3 = 2` and `p_2 = 1` divides `p_4 = 3`.

To ensure the permutation is valid, the program needs to be more sophisticated in how it shuffles the elements to avoid such divisibility conditions.
