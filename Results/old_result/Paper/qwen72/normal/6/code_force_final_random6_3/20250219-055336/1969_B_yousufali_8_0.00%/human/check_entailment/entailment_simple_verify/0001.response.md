### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Input Handling in `func_1`:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the line `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` is incorrect. This line assumes that the input is a space-separated list of integers, which is not the case for a binary string.
   - The correct way to read a binary string is `s = input().strip()`, and then convert it to a list of integers using `s = list(map(int, s))`.

3. **Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes `n` to 0, which is used to count the number of 1s encountered.
   - It also initializes `ans` to 0, which is used to accumulate the total cost.
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - If the character is 1, it increments `n`.
   - If the character is 0 and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. This is because the cost of cyclically shifting a substring of length `n + 1` (where `n` is the number of 1s and 1 is the 0) is `n + 1`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the cost is correct. The idea is to count the number of 1s and then, whenever a 0 is encountered, add the cost of shifting the substring containing the 1s and the 0.
   - However, the input handling in `func_1` is incorrect, which will cause the program to fail on actual test cases.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at key points.
   - The state after the loop in `func_1` is accurately described: `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `n` is the number of 1s in the list `s`, and `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each 0 in `s` that is preceded by at least one 1.
   - The final state and output are also correctly described.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment is accurate in identifying the incorrect input handling in `func_1`.
   - The logic for calculating the minimum total cost to make the string sorted is correct, but the program will not work as intended due to the input handling issue.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the incorrect input handling in `func_1`. The function `func_1` should read the binary string as a single string and then convert it to a list of integers.
