The value of `c` is incremented by the value of `ele`, which is the third element in the list `l`. The other variables `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The list `l` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`, `c` is increased by the value of `ele`.**
