Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 1` and `r` must be greater than 2, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`, `a[2]` must be equal to `a[3]`, `st` is 3, `end` is 0, `ans` is the difference `r - l`**.

The value of `st` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
