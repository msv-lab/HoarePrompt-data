Postcondition: **`N` is the input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `tc` is 1, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values and now contains the count of each integer in the list `a`, `t` is 0, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user. The count of `i` (which is 0) in the list `a` is exactly 1, but the current value of `t` is 0, and either `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or the count of `i` in `cnt` is 0.**
