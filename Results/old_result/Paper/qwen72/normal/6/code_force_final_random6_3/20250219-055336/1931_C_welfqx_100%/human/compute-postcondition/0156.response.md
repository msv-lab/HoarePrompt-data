The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` will start at 0 and iterate up to `n - 2`.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` will start at 0. The other variables and conditions mentioned in the state before the loop starts do not affect the loop head directly, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
