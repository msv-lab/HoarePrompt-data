The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer indicating the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it accepts another parameter `n`, which is an integer representing the size of the array, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, it accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and `n`, inclusive. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and indicates some property or computation based on the array `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts a parameter `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) representing the size of the array, and a parameter `a` which is a list of `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= n). The function returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case.**
