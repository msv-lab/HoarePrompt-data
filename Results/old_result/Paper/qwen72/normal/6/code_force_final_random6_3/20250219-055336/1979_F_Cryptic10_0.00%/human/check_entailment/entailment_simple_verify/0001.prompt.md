You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

Kostyanych has chosen a complete undirected graph^{\dagger} with n vertices,
and then removed exactly (n - 2) edges from it. You can ask queries of the
following type:

  * "? d " — Kostyanych tells you the number of vertex v with a degree at least d . Among all possible such vertices, he selects the vertex with the minimum degree, and if there are several such vertices, he selects the one with the minimum number. He also tells you the number of another vertex in the graph, with which v is not connected by an edge (if none is found, then 0 is reported). Among all possible such vertices, he selects the one with the minimum number. Then he removes the vertex v and all edges coming out of it. If the required vertex v is not found, then "0\ 0 " is reported. 

Find a Hamiltonian path^{\ddagger} in the original graph in at most n queries.
It can be proven that under these constraints, a Hamiltonian path always
exists.

^{\dagger} A complete undirected graph is a graph in which there is exactly
one undirected edge between any pair of distinct vertices. Thus, a complete
undirected graph with n vertices contains \frac{n(n-1)}{2} edges.

^{\ddagger} A Hamiltonian path in a graph is a path that passes through each
vertex exactly once.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of vertices in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Interaction

Interaction for each test case begins with reading the integer n .

Then you can make no more than n queries.

To make a query, output a line in the format "? d " (without quotes) (0 \le d
\le n - 1 ). After each query, read two integers — the answer to your query.

When you are ready to report the answer, output a line in the format "! v_1\
v_2 \ldots v_n " (without quotes) — the vertices in the order of their
occurrence in the Hamiltonian path. Outputting the answer does not count as
one of the n queries. After solving one test case, the program should
immediately move on to the next one. After solving all test cases, the program
should be terminated immediately.

If your program makes more than n queries for one test case or makes an
incorrect query, then the response to the query will be -1 , and after
receiving such a response, your program should immediately terminate to
receive the verdict Wrong answer. Otherwise, it may receive any other verdict.

After outputting a query, do not forget to output an end of line and flush the
output buffer. Otherwise, you will receive the verdict Idleness limit
exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see documentation for other languages. 

The interactor is non-adaptive. The graph does not change during the
interaction.

Hacks

To hack, use the following format:

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of vertices in the graph.

Each of the following (n - 2) lines should contains two integers u and v (1
\le u, v \le n , u \ne v ) — ends of the edge that was removed from the graph.
Each edge must not occur more than once.

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^5 .

Note

In the first test case, the original graph looks as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/75d8c5328ccca8f82b69ba8300140bed4d40ce80.png)

Consider the queries:

  * There are no vertices with a degree of at least 3 in the graph, so "0\ 0 " is reported.
  * There are four vertices with a degree of at least 2 , and all of them have a degree of exactly 2 : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Vertex 1 is reported, because it has the minimum number, and vertex 4 is reported, because it is the only one not connected to vertex 1 . After this, vertex 1 is removed from the graph.
  * There are three vertices with a degree of at least 1 , among them vertices 2 and 3 have a minimum degree of 1 (vertex 4 has a degree of 2 ). Vertex 2 is reported, because it has the minimum number, and vertex 3 is reported, because it is the only one not connected to vertex 2 . After this, vertex 2 is removed from the graph.

The path 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 is a Hamiltonian path.

In the second test case, the original graph looks as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/44d26c229eaff752c0a00c7160792daef41c7502.png)

Consider the queries:

  * Vertex 1 has a degree of at least 3 , but it is connected to all vertices, so "1\ 0 " is reported. After this, vertex 1 is removed from the graph.
  * The remaining vertices 2 , 3 , and 4 have a degree of at least 0 , but among them vertex 4 has the minimum degree of 0 (vertices 2 and 3 have a degree of 1 ). Vertex 4 is not connected to both vertices 2 and 3 , so vertex 2 is reported (as it has the minimum number). After this, vertex 4 is removed from the graph.

The path 4 - 1 - 2 - 3 is a Hamiltonian path.

In the third test case, the graph consists of 2 vertices connected by an edge.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a complete undirected graph with \( n \) vertices, and \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed.
   - We need to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using at most \( n \) queries.
   - Each query asks for a vertex \( v \) with a degree at least \( d \) and another vertex \( u \) not connected to \( v \).

2. **Interaction Protocol:**
   - The query format is `"? d"`, and the response is a pair of integers \((v, u)\).
   - If no vertex with a degree at least \( d \) is found, the response is \((0, 0)\).
   - If a vertex \( v \) is found, it is removed from the graph along with all its edges.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program starts by initializing an empty list `path` and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from 1 to \( n \).
   - It then enters a loop that continues until `remaining_vertices` is empty.
   - Inside the loop, it iterates over possible degrees \( d \) from \( n-1 \) down to 0.
   - For each degree \( d \), it makes a query to find a vertex \( v \) with a degree at least \( d \) and another vertex \( u \) not connected to \( v \).
   - If \( v \) is found and is still in `remaining_vertices`, it adds \( v \) to the `path` and removes \( v \) from `remaining_vertices`.
   - The loop ensures that the program continues to find and remove vertices until all vertices are processed.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly handles the query responses and updates the `path` and `remaining_vertices` accordingly.
   - By starting with the highest degree and working down, the algorithm ensures that it finds a vertex with the minimum degree that meets the criteria.
   - The removal of vertices and edges is done correctly, and the program ensures that it does not exceed the \( n \) query limit.
   - The final path is printed in the correct format, and the output is flushed to ensure proper interaction with the judge.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no vertex with a degree at least \( d \) is found by continuing to the next degree.
   - It also handles the case where the graph is fully processed and `remaining_vertices` is empty by breaking out of the loop and printing the path.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The algorithm makes at most \( n \) queries, which is within the allowed limit.
   - The time complexity is \( O(n^2) \) in the worst case, but this is acceptable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by finding a Hamiltonian path in the graph using the allowed number of queries. The logic and interaction with the judge are handled appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
