Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), and `i` is `n`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` is decremented to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `n` holds the value of the last input integer provided for the grid size, which is within the range 2 to 10^3. The variable `i` is also set to the last value of `n` after the final iteration of the inner loop. All other variables that were not modified within the loop remain unchanged.
