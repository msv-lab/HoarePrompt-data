Postcondition: ***`sng` is processed until `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, or `sng` is exhausted, `sz` is now 0, `rdb` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
