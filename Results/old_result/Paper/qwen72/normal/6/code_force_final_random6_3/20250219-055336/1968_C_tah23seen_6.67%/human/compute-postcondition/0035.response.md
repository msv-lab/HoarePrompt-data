Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is the smallest value greater than `arr[i]` that can be achieved by repeatedly adding `ans[i-1]` to `ans[i]` if `ans[i]` was originally less than `arr[i]`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is equal to `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`. The last element `ans[n-1]` is equal to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`.**
