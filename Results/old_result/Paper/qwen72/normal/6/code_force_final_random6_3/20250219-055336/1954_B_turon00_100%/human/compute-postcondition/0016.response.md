Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and `0`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`.
- Given the initial state, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum of `n` and `0`.
- Since `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` will be 0 after the execution of the code.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `i` remain unchanged.
