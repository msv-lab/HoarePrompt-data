### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads `k` moves, each consisting of two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Handling Moves:**
   - For each move `(a, b)`, the program checks if `a` is not equal to `b`.
   - If `a` is not equal to `b`, it reduces `n` by 2 because both the player and the computer place a rook, and these rooks occupy two different rows and columns.
   - If `a` is equal to `b`, it reduces `n` by 1 because only the player places a rook, and the computer skips its turn.
   - This logic is correct and aligns with the problem's description.

3. **Dynamic Programming for Counting Configurations:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` is used to compute the number of possible final configurations.
   - The dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` is initialized with `[1, 1]`, representing the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1`.
   - The DP transition is defined as:
     \[
     dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2]
     \]
     This transition accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in an `i x i` board:
     - `dp[i-1]` represents the number of ways to place rooks in a `(i-1) x (i-1)` board.
     - `2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]` represents the number of ways to place a rook in the `i-th` row and column, and then place rooks in the remaining `(i-2) x (i-2)` board.
   - The transition formula is correct and matches the problem's requirements.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The result of each DP transition is taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers.
   - This ensures that the results are within the required range and prevents integer overflow.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case.
   - The output is correctly formatted and matches the problem's requirements.

### Validation of Annotations:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, and it is guaranteed that `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5`.
  - This is correct and ensures that the function `func_1` is called with a valid input.

- **State within the function `func_1`:**
  - `dp` is a list with two elements: `[dp[n-2], dp[n-1]]`.
  - `i` is `n` when the loop ends.
  - The function returns the value of `dp[n-1]`, which is the second element in the list `dp` representing the dynamic programming state for the `(n-1)th` position on the chessboard.
  - This is correct and ensures that the function returns the correct value for the given `n`.

### Final Evaluation:

The program correctly handles the input and test cases, reduces `n` based on the moves, and uses a dynamic programming approach to count the configurations. The modulo operation ensures that the results are within the required range. The annotations validate the program's state and behavior at key points, confirming that the program operates as intended.

Final: **True**
