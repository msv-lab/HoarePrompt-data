Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + n + 3]` and must be greater than 0, `t` remains `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + n + 3 + n`, `data` remains a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is a list containing two string representations of `ans`, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `v[x]` is now `n`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is `k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) // 6` where `k` is the value of `v[i]` and `k >= 3`. Otherwise, `v[i]` is 0. `cnt` is 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[n + n + 2 + n - 1]`, `_` is `n - 1`.***
