The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n * 2` and `t` is greater than `n * 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans` (now with an additional element), `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, and `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter.**
