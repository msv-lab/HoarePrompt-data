### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Input Handling in `func_1`:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the line `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` is incorrect. This line assumes that the input is a space-separated list of integers, which is not the case for a binary string.
   - The correct way to read a binary string is `s = input().strip()`.
   - After reading the string, it should be converted to a list of integers for further processing, which can be done using `s = list(map(int, s))`.

3. **Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes `n` to 0, which is used to count the number of 1s encountered.
   - It also initializes `ans` to 0, which is used to accumulate the total cost.
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - If the character is 1, it increments `n`.
   - If the character is 0 and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. This is because the cost of cyclically shifting a substring of length `n + 1` (where `n` is the number of 1s and 1 is the 0) is `n + 1`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the cost is correct. The idea is to count the number of 1s and then, whenever a 0 is encountered, add the cost of shifting the substring containing the 1s and the 0.
   - However, the input handling in `func_1` is incorrect, which will cause the program to fail on actual test cases.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect due to the incorrect input handling in `func_1`. The function `func_1` should read the binary string as a single string and then convert it to a list of integers.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1():
    s = input().strip()  # Read the binary string
    s = list(map(int, s))  # Convert the string to a list of integers
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
