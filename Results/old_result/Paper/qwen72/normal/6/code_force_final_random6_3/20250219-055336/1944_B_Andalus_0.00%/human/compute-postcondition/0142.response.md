Postcondition: ***`sng` is an empty list or a list containing the element `lft[i]`, `sz` is the last even number less than `k` that can be achieved by adding 2 in each iteration, `T` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` and is now sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is a list containing the first element of `lft` if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, otherwise `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `i` is 2. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `sng` remains an empty list. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` contains the element `lft[i]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list.***
