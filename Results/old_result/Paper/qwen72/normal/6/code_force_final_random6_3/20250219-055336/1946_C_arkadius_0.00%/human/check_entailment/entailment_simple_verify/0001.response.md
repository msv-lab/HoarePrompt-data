### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number `x` such that after removing exactly `k` edges, the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`.
   - The solution involves a binary search to find the maximum `x` and a depth-first search (DFS) to verify if a given `x` is valid.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program is structured into five functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5`.
   - `func_5` is the main function that reads input, constructs the tree, and prints the result.
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum `x`.
   - `func_3` checks if a given `x` is valid by using `func_1` or `func_2`.
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are helper functions to traverse the tree and count the number of good components and remaining sizes.

3. **Detailed Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function uses a stack to perform a non-recursive DFS.
     - It correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex based on its children.
     - The function ensures that the `good_components` count includes components of size at least `x` and the `remaining_size` is the sum of sizes of components smaller than `x`.
   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function performs a recursive DFS.
     - It also correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex based on its children.
     - The function ensures the same behavior as `func_1`, but in a recursive manner.
   - **`func_3`**:
     - This function uses `func_1` to determine if a given `x` is valid.
     - It checks if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if it is exactly `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`.
     - The function correctly returns `True` if the conditions are met, otherwise `False`.
   - **`func_4`**:
     - This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the conditions.
     - It uses `func_3` to check the validity of the current midpoint `mid`.
     - The function correctly narrows down the search range and returns the maximum valid `x`.
   - **`func_5`**:
     - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and prints the result.
     - It correctly initializes the tree and adds edges.
     - It roots the tree and calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum `x`.

4. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, constructs the tree, and prints the result.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle edge cases such as a tree with a single vertex or a tree where `k` is close to `n-1`.
   - The binary search in `func_4` ensures that the maximum `x` is found efficiently.
   - The non-recursive DFS in `func_1` and the recursive DFS in `func_2` both handle the traversal correctly, ensuring that the tree is processed in a depth-first manner.

6. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program's logic and structure align with the problem requirements.
   - The use of DFS and binary search is appropriate for the problem.
   - The functions correctly update and check the necessary conditions to determine the maximum `x`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem as described.

Final: **True**
