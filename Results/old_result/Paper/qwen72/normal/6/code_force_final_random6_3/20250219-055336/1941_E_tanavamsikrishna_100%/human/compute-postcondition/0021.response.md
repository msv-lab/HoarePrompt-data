To determine the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `row`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `for i in range(d, len(row))`. The variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `row`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0.
   - `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`.
   - `i` is greater than `d + 2`.
   - `min_heap` is a min-heap containing the elements from `row[:d]` and their respective indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed from the heap, and `e` has been added to the heap.
   - `row[i]` is now equal to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.
   - The tuple `(row[i], i)` has been added to `min_heap`.

3. **Adjusting `i`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is greater than `d + 2`.
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

4. **Adjusting `row`**:
   - The loop iterates over the range `d` to `len(row)`.
   - The state of `row` does not change in the loop head itself; it is modified within the loop body.
   - Since the loop head only depends on the length of `row` and the value of `i`, we do not need to adjust `row` directly in the loop head.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is now `i + 1`.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(row)`.

### Final State:
State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0; `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`; `i` is greater than `d + 3`; `min_heap` is a min-heap containing the elements from `row[:d]` and their respective indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed from the heap, and `e` has been added to the heap; `row[i-1]` is equal to `e[0] + row[i-1] + 1`; the tuple `(row[i-1], i-1)` has been added to `min_heap`.**
