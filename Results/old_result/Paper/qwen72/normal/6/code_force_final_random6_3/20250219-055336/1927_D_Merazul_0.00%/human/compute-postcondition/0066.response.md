Output State: **`a` is a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `k` must be greater than 0, `t` is now `t - 1` (but still greater than 0), `n` is `k // 2`, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `f` is 1, `m` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `u` is `True` if `1` is in `a`, otherwise `u` is `False`.**
