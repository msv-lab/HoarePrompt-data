Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x != y, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, and `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, the variables retain their initial values. If `k` is not a power of 2, and if `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, `n` is 0, `m` is an input integer greater than 0 and odd, and `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `n` is 0 and `m` is even, no changes are made to `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. Otherwise, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is 2.***
