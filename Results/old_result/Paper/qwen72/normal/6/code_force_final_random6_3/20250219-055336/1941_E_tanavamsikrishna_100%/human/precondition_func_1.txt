The function does not take any parameters, but it reads input from the standard input. The first line of input contains four integers n, m, k, and d such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100 and 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. The next n lines each contain m integers representing the depths of the river cells, where 0 ≤ a_{i, j} ≤ 10^6 and a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0.
