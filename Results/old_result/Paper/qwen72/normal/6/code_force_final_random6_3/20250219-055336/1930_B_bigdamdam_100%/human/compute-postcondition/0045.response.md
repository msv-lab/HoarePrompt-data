Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `p[1]` is `ind + 2`, `p[3]` is `ind`.** 

The code snippet `p[i] = ind` updates the list `p` at index `i` (which is 3) to the value of `ind`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `p[3]` is now `ind`, and the rest of the initial state is still valid.
