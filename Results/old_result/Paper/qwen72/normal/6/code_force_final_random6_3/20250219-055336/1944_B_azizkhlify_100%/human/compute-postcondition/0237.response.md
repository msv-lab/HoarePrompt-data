Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The element at the index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a[i]` is `a[0]`.

4. **Given Information:**
   - The element at the index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is 2. This means that `a[0] - 1` is a valid index in the list `l` and the value at that index is 2.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]`.
   - The print statement will print `a[0]` twice, followed by a space (because of `end=' '`).

6. **Output:**
   - The exact value of `a[0]` is not provided, but we know it is an integer that is greater than 0 (since `a[0] - 1` is a valid index in `l`).
   - Therefore, the print statement will output `a[0]` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **a[0] a[0] (where a[0] is the first element of the list a and is an integer greater than 0)**
