Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 2`, `path` is a list that includes at most one vertex from the initial `remaining_vertices` set. `v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` includes `v`, `remaining_vertices` no longer contains `v` but still contains at least one vertex, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `path` remains unchanged and `remaining_vertices` still contains at least one vertex.**
