Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Loop and List Manipulation**:
   - The program attempts to remove elements from the list using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`. This is incorrect because `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` always evaluate to 0 and 2, respectively, which are not the correct indices to remove elements from the list.
   - The correct approach should be to sort the list and then sum the first `n` elements, as the minimum value in each pair will always be one of the smallest `n` elements in the sorted list.

2. **Inefficient and Incorrect Logic**:
   - The program does not sort the list, which is necessary to ensure that the minimum values are always selected.
   - The program also does not handle the case where the list has more than 2 elements correctly. It should continue to pick pairs until all elements are used.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()
        ans = sum(lst[:n])
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for ans in ans_f:
        print(ans)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the number of pairs `n` and the list of integers `lst`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the list `lst` to ensure that the smallest `n` elements are at the beginning.

3. **Summing the Minimum Values**:
   - Sum the first `n` elements of the sorted list, which are the minimum values of each pair.

4. **Output**:
   - Append the result to `ans_f` and print the results for each test case.

This corrected program will correctly compute the maximum final score for each test case.
