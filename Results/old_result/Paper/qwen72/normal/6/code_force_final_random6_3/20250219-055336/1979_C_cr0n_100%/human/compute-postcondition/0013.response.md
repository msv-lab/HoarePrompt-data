Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed when the `print` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
1. `N` is an input integer where \(1 \leq N \leq 50\).
2. `vals` is a list of `N` integers, where each integer \(k_i\) satisfies \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\).
3. `den` is the result of `den - sum(vprod)`, where `vprod` is a list of `N` integers.
4. Each element in `vprod` is calculated as `(den // r)` for each `r` in `vals`.
5. The current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `N` and `vals`**:
   - `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 50.
   - `vals` is a list of `N` integers, each between 2 and 20.

2. **Calculation of `vprod`**:
   - `vprod` is a list of `N` integers.
   - Each element in `vprod` is calculated as `(den // r)` for each `r` in `vals`.
   - Since `den` is less than or equal to 0, and each `r` in `vals` is a positive integer (between 2 and 20), each element in `vprod` will be a non-positive integer (either 0 or a negative integer).

3. **Update of `den`**:
   - `den` is updated to `den - sum(vprod)`.
   - Since each element in `vprod` is non-positive, `sum(vprod)` will be non-positive.
   - Subtracting a non-positive number from `den` (which is already less than or equal to 0) will result in `den` remaining less than or equal to 0.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The code snippet contains the statement `print(-1)`.
   - This statement will print the integer `-1` regardless of the values of `N`, `vals`, `den`, or `vprod`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print `-1` because the value `-1` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **-1**
