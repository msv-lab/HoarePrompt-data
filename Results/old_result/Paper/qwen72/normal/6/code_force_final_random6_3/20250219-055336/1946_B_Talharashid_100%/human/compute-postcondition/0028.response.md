The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop condition is based on the comparison of `i` with the integer value provided by `int(input())`. Since the loop is iterating over a range, the value of `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 1, and the integer value provided by `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `c` is the sum of the non-negative subsequence of `l` that has the highest sum, and `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`. `int(input())` must be greater than 1**
