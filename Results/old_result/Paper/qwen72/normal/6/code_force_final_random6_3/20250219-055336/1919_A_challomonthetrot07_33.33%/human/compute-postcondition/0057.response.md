Postcondition: ***`T` is an input integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 1000, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` == `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` is that they are equal. If `a` != `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` is maintained: if `a` is 1, the current value of `a` is 1, and the current value of `b` is not 1. If `a` is not 1, the current value of `a` is not 1, and the relationship between `a` and `b` is preserved: if `a` is odd, `a` remains an odd integer; if `a` is even, `a` remains an even integer; if `a` is even and `b` is odd, then `b` is odd; otherwise, if `a` > `b`, `a` is greater than `b`; if `a` <= `b`, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.***
