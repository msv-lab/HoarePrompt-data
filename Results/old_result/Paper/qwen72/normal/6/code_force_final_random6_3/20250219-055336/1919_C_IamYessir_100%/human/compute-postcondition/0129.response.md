Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are empty lists, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged. If `a` is empty, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. The current value of `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a`, and the length of `b` is 0.**
