The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`. For each subsequent element from index 1 to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is calculated as `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`, and if `ans[i]` is less than `arr[i]`, it is incremented by repeatedly adding `ans[i-1]` until it is greater than or equal to `arr[i]`. The last element `ans[n-1]` is set to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`.
