Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros except `values[0]` which is 0 and `values[1]` which is 1, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 0, `i` is 1, `sum_values[0]` is 0**

Explanation: The code snippet `values[i] = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to the element at index `i` in the `values` list. Since `i` is 1, `values[1]` is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
