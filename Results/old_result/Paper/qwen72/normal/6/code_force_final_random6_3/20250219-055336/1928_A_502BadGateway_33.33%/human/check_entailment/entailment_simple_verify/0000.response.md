Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program only checks if `b` is even, which is insufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. The problem states that Bob can form another rectangle if and only if one of the dimensions `a` or `b` is even and greater than 1. This is because if either dimension is even and greater than 1, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a different rectangle. If both dimensions are odd or if the even dimension is 1, Bob cannot form a different rectangle.

Let's break down the reasoning with the annotated code:

1. **Input Handling**:
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
       print(func_1(a, b))
   ```
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the dimensions of the rectangles.
   - The state of the program right before the function call: `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   ```python
   def func_1(a, b):
       return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
   ```
   - The function returns 'yes' if `b` is even, otherwise it returns 'no'.
   - This logic is incomplete because it does not consider the case where `a` is even and greater than 1, or where both `a` and `b` are 1.

3. **Examples**:
   - For the input `3 3`:
     - The function `func_1(3, 3)` will return 'no' because `b` is not even.
     - The correct answer is 'no' because neither `a` nor `b` is even, and thus Bob cannot form another rectangle.
   - For the input `1 2`:
     - The function `func_1(1, 2)` will return 'yes' because `b` is even.
     - The correct answer is 'no' because the 1x2 rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form a different rectangle.

4. **Correct Logic**:
   - The correct logic should check if either `a` or `b` is even and greater than 1.
   - If both `a` and `b` are 1, the answer should be 'no' because the 1x1 rectangle cannot be cut.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is correct, and the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
