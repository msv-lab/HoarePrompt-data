Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is `a[0]`, `ans_list` contains `a[0]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`, `dif` is not 0, `k` is 0, `res` is `n - 1 + 0 % (i + 1)` if `i` is not 0, otherwise `res` remains `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
