You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads two lines of input: the first line contains three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` sets of `k` unique characters. If it does, the function prints 'YES' and returns `None`. If it does not, the function prints 'NO' and then, for each character in the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that was not part of the last incomplete set, it prints a string consisting of the characters that completed the previous sets, followed by the character, and padded with 'a' characters to reach a total length of `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Set Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. This is correct and necessary for the problem.

3. **Subsequence Checking**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed using the first `k` alphabets.
   - It maintains a set `win` to track the current window of characters.
   - For each character `i` in the string `s`, if `i` is in `us`, it adds `i` to `win`.
   - If `win` contains all `k` alphabets, it adds `i` to `ans` and increments `ps` (which counts the number of valid subsequences found).
   - It then clears `win` to start a new window.

4. **Output**:
   - If `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints 'YES' and returns.
   - If `ps` is less than `n`, it prints 'NO'.
   - It then attempts to print a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s` by appending characters not in `win` and padding with 'a'.

5. **Issues**:
   - The program does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` occur as subsequences in `s`.
   - The logic for generating a string that does not occur as a subsequence is flawed. It only appends characters not in `win` and pads with 'a', which may not always produce a valid non-subsequence string.
   - The program does not generate all possible strings of length `n` and check each one against `s`.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, you need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.
   - For each generated string, check if it is a subsequence of `s`.
   - If any generated string is not a subsequence, print 'NO' and the string.
   - If all generated strings are subsequences, print 'YES'.

Given the issues in the logic and the incorrect approach to generating and checking subsequences, the program is incorrect.
