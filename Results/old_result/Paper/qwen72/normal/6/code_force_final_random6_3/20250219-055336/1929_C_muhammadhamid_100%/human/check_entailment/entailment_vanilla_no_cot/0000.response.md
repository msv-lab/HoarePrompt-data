Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins. The issue lies in the approach used to calculate the value `s`.

The program attempts to calculate a value `s` that represents the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to start with to guarantee he can win any number of coins. However, the logic used to calculate `s` is flawed.

The program uses the following loop to calculate `s`:

```python
for i in range(x):
    s += s // (k - 1) + 1
```

This loop is intended to simulate the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row, but it does not correctly model the strategy needed to guarantee winning any number of coins. Specifically, the calculation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` does not accurately represent the amount of coins Sasha would need to have after each loss to ensure he can still achieve his goal.

To correctly solve the problem, Sasha needs to ensure that even after losing `x` times in a row, he can still recover and win more coins. The correct approach involves calculating the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to start with to guarantee he can always recover from `x` consecutive losses.

The correct logic should be:

1. Calculate the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to start with to guarantee he can recover from `x` consecutive losses.
2. This can be done by ensuring that after `x` consecutive losses, Sasha still has at least 1 coin left to place a bet.
3. The formula to calculate this minimum amount is `s = (k - 1) * x + 1`.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = (k - 1) * x + 1
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
```

This corrected program will correctly determine if Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins based on the given problem description.
