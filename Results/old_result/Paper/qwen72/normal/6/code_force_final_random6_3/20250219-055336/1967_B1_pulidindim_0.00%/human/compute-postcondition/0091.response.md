Output State: **`t` is a specific positive integer provided by the user and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user with `m` being greater than or equal to 5, `count` is 6, `g` is now equal to `n / 5 - 2`, `ans` is now equal to `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + g / 4 + 1 + g / count + 1`, `countmins` is 2. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing from 5 to 6. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
