Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n - 3`, `max` is the maximum value among the second elements of all sorted sublists of length 3 in `a`. If `n` is equal to 2, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
