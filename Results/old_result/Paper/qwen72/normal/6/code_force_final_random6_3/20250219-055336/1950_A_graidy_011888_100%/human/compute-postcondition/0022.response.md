The given `print` statement is:
```
print('PEAK')
```

Based on the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits (integers) provided by the user input.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- The conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c` are:
  - If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is less than `c`.
  - If `a < b and b > c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is greater than `c`.
  - If none of these conditions hold, then `a`, `b`, and `c` do not satisfy `a < b < c` or `a < b and b > c`.

However, the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the string `'PEAK'`.

Output: **PEAK**
