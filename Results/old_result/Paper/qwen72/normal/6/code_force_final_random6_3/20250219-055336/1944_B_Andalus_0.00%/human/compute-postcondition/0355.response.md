Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` remains `n - 1`.
   - `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.
   - `rdb` remains unchanged.
   - `sz` is now `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + 2`.
   - The loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(rdb))` elements of `rdb` twice each.
   - `sng` must have at least 3 elements.
   - `elem` is the third element in `sng`.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop has been exited and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - If `sz` is less than `k` and `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then the loop has printed additional elements up to `k` times.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `elem` is explicitly defined as the third element in the list `sng`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space rather than a newline.

4. **Determine the Output:**
   - Since `elem` is the third element in `sng`, and `sng` must have at least 3 elements, the value of `elem` is known.
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `elem` followed by a space.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be the third element of the list `sng` followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the third element in the list sng)**
