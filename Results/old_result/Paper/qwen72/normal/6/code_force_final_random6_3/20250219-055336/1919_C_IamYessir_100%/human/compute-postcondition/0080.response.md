Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2. If the length of `lit` is 0, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `lit`. If the length of `b` is 0, `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` is greater than or equal to the third element of `lit` and the third element of `lit` is greater than `y`, then `a` is a list containing the third element of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged.***
