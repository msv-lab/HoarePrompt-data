Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is `i + 1`, `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` are integers, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `_` is incremented by 1, `y` retains its original value. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. The value `lit[i]` is appended to the list `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `b`.
- The value of `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`, so `i` is still less than `n`.
- The value of `y` is determined by the length of `b` after the append operation. If `b` was initially empty, `y` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b` before the append operation.
- The value of `x` is determined by the length of `a`. If `a` is empty, `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`.
- The states of `s`, `n`, `cp`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The list `lit` remains unchanged, but the value `lit[i]` is now part of `b`.
- The value of `y` is updated to the last element of `b` after the append operation if `b` was not initially empty. If `b` was initially empty, `y` remains `float('inf')`.
