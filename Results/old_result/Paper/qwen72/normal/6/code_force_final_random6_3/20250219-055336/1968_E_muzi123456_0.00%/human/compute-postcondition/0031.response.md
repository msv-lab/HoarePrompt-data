Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 48) and is now `t - 3` with `t` being at least 3, `n` is a new input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), `i` is `n`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns a new input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) to the variable `n`. The value of `i` is then updated to be equal to the new value of `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, where it is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 48) and is now `t - 3` with `t` being at least 3.
