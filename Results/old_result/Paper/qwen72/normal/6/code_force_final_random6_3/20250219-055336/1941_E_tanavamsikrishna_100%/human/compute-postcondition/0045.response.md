The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `row` and `d`. `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first and last elements are initially 0. `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d < len(row). The function always returns 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `row` of non-negative integers with the first and last elements being 0, and a positive integer `d` such that 1 <= d < len(row). It always returns 0.**
