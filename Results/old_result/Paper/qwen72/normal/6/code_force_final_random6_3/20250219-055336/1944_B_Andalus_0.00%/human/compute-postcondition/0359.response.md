The function `func` accepts three parameters: an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a`. The integer `n` is constrained such that `2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`, and the integer `k` is constrained such that `1 <= k <= floor(n / 2)`. The list `a` is of length `2n` and contains integers from `1` to `n`, each appearing exactly twice. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.
