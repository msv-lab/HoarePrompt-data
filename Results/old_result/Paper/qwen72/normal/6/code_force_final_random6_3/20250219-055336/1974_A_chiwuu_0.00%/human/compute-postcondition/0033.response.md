Output State: **`a` is an integer representing the first value input by the user, `b` is an integer representing the second value input by the user, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t1`.**

Explanation:
- `t2` is assigned the value of `a - t1`.
- The value of `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, where `t` is updated based on the condition `t % 5 == 0` or `t % 5 != 0`.
- The values of `a`, `b`, `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The value of `t2` is now `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`.
