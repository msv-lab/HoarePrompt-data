Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in determining whether the time is AM or PM. Specifically, the condition for setting `day` to 'PM' is incorrect. The program sets `day` to 'PM' if the hour is greater than 12, but it also sets `day` to 'PM' if the hour is exactly 12, which is incorrect. The correct behavior should be to set `day` to 'AM' if the hour is less than 12, and to 'PM' if the hour is 12 or greater.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h >= 12:
            day = 'PM'
            if h > 12:
                h -= 12
        else:
            day = 'AM'
            if h == 0:
                h = 12
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

This corrected version correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, including the special cases for 00:00 and 12:00.
