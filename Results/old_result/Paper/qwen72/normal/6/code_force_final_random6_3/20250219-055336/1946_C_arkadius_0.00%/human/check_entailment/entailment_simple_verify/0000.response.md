### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Class and Methods:**
   - The `Tree` class and its methods (`add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`, etc.) are defined in the annotated code. This means the original assessment's concern about the missing `Tree` class and methods is invalid. The `Tree` class and its methods are present and seem to be implemented correctly.

2. **Rooting the Tree:**
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` function is used to root the tree, and it is defined in the annotated code. This function uses a stack to perform a non-recursive DFS to root the tree at vertex 0. The function correctly sets the parent and children for each vertex, and it also calculates the `subtree_size` for each vertex. This ensures that the tree is properly rooted before the other functions are called.

3. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function performs a non-recursive DFS to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree for each vertex. The function correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex based on the conditions provided in the problem description. The state annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected.

4. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function is a recursive version of `func_1` and is used to calculate the same values. The function correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex. The state annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected.

5. **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
   - This function checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`. It uses `func_1` to get the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for the root vertex. The function correctly returns `True` if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if the number of good components is equal to `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`. The state annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected.

6. **Function 4 (`func_4`):**
   - This function uses binary search to find the maximum `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and satisfy the conditions. It calls `func_3` with different values of `x` to determine the maximum valid `x`. The function correctly updates the search range based on the result of `func_3`. The state annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected.

7. **Function 5 (`func_5`):**
   - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and then prints the result of `func_4`. The function correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem statement. The state annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was incorrect because it failed to recognize that the `Tree` class and its methods, including `root_tree_non_recursive`, were defined in the annotated code. The program, as annotated, correctly handles the problem description and the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
