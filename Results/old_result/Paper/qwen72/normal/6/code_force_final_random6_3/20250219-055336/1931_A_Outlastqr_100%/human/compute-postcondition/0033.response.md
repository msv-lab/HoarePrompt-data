Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 3 to 78, `i` is 2, `word` is a string containing 'a' followed by the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` list, followed by 'z'.**

Explanation:
- The variable `word` is updated by concatenating 'a', the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` list, and 'z'.
- The value of `n` remains within the range 3 to 78.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The `alphabet` list is assumed to be a list of characters from 'a' to 'z', so the character at index `n - 28` will be a lowercase letter. For example, if `n` is 30, `n - 28` is 2, and the character at index 2 in the `alphabet` list is 'c', then `word` will be 'acz'.
