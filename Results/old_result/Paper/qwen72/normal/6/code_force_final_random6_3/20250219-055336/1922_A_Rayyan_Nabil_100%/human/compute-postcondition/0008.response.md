The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t` and the current value of `_`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `results` is a list that now includes the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**
