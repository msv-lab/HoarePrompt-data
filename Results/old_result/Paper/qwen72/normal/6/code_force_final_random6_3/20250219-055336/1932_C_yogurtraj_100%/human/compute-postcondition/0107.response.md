Postcondition: **`ii` is 2, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 1 and updated to the values provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `t` is a user input string, `l` is the number of times the character 'L' appears in the string `t`, `i` is `n - 2`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where each element is 0 except the last element which is `k`. If the last character of `t` is 'L', `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2`, and `q2` is `l`. Otherwise, `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, and `q2` is `l + 1`. Additionally, the character at index `i` in the string `t` is not 'R'.**
