Output State: **`a` and `p` remain unchanged, `s` is updated to `p[s]`, `k` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` remains unchanged, `mx` is updated to `max(mx, cur + (k-1) * a[s])`, `cur` is updated to `a[P_B] + a[P_S] + a[s]`, `vis[s]` is `True`**

Explanation:
- `vis[s]` is updated to `True` (previously it was `False`).
- All other variables (`a`, `p`, `s`, `k`, `n`, `mx`, `cur`) retain their updated values as described in the initial state.
