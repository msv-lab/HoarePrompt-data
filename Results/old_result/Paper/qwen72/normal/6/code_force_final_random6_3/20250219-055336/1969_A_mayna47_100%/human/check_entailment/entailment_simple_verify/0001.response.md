### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `v`.

2. **Array Initialization:**
   - The array `v` is initialized with an extra element at the beginning (index 0) to make the indices 1-based, which aligns with the problem's description.

3. **Checking for Mutual Best Friends:**
   - The program iterates over each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - It checks if `v[v[i]] == i`, which means that friend `i` and friend `v[i]` are mutual best friends.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns immediately, as inviting both friends in this pair will ensure that both come to the party.

4. **Default Case:**
   - If no mutual best friends are found, the program prints `3` and returns.
   - This assumption is not always correct. The default case should consider the possibility of inviting friends in a way that ensures at least 2 friends come to the party, even if no mutual best friends are found.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Correctness of Mutual Best Friends Check:**
  - The condition `v[v[i]] == i` correctly identifies pairs of mutual best friends.
  - If such a pair is found, inviting both friends will ensure that both come to the party, which satisfies the requirement of having at least 2 friends at the party.

- **Default Case:**
  - The default case assumes that if no mutual best friends are found, the minimum number of invitations needed is 3.
  - This assumption is not always correct. For example, consider the case where `n = 4` and `p = [2, 1, 4, 3]`. In this case, there are no mutual best friends, but inviting friends 1 and 2 will still ensure that both come to the party, as friend 1's best friend is 2 and friend 2's best friend is 1.

### Counterexample:
- For the input:
  ```
  1
  4
  2 1 4 3
  ```
  - The program will print `3`, but the correct answer should be `2` because friends 1 and 2 are mutual best friends, and inviting them will ensure both come to the party.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to identify situations where there are multiple pairs of mutual best friends or where the minimum number of invitations needed is less than 3 even if no mutual best friends are found.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
