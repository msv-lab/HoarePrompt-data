Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is the hour part of the input time minus 12, `m` is the minute part of the input time, and `h` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `h` is updated to `h - 12`.
- Since the initial value of `h` was greater than 12, after subtracting 12, `h` will be a positive integer less than or equal to 12.
- The values of `t`, `s`, `day`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
