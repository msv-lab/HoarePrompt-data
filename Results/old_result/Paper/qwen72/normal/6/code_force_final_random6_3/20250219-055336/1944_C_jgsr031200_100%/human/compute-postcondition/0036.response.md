Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. `freq` is a list where each element at index `i` corresponds to the number of times the integer `i` appears in `arr`. `n` remains unchanged, and `i` is the index at which the loop either prints a value and breaks or completes all iterations without printing. `cou` is 2 if two unique integers were found, otherwise it is 1 or 0. If `cou` is 2 or a 0 frequency integer is encountered, the loop prints that integer and breaks. If the loop completes all iterations without printing, `i` is `n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `0` to `n` (inclusive).
- If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop continues to the next iteration.
- If `freq[i]` is 1, `cou` is incremented by 1.
- If `cou` reaches 2 or `freq[i]` is 0, the loop prints `i` and breaks.
- If the loop completes all iterations without printing, `i` will be `n + 1`, and `cou` will be 1 or 0 depending on how many unique integers were found.
