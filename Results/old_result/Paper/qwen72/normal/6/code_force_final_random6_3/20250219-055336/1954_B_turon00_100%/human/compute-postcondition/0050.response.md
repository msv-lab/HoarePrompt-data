The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` is either 1 or 2 if `a[1]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise it is 0. Therefore, after the increment, `cnt` will be 2 or 3 if `a[1]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise it will be 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 2 or 3 if `a[1]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 1, and `ans` is equal to `n` if `a[1]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is 0.**
