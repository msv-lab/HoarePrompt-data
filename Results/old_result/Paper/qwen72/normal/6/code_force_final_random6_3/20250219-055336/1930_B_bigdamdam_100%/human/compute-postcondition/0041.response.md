The objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 and `i` starts at 1. Given the initial state, `i` is set to `n - (n % 2)`, which might not be 1. For the loop to execute, `i` needs to be 1, and `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure that the range has at least one element.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
