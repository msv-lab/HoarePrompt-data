You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing four elements: an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It returns a list `results` where each element corresponds to the sum of the counts of specific remainders for the numbers in `arr`. Specifically, for each number in `arr`, the function calculates the remainder when the number is divided by `x` and the remainder when the number is divided by `y`. It then adds to the count the number of times these remainders have been seen before in the current test case. The final state of the program is that `test_cases` remains unchanged, and `results` contains the computed counts for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly count the number of beautiful pairs as described in the problem. The logic for counting pairs is flawed. Specifically, the program is incrementing the count based on the current number's mod values, which does not ensure that both conditions for a beautiful pair (i.e., \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\)) are met simultaneously.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 3 2
1 2 4 5
```
The expected output is 1, as the only beautiful pair is \(\langle 1, 4 \rangle\):
- \(a_1 + a_4 = 1 + 5 = 6\) (6 is divisible by 3)
- \(a_1 - a_4 = 1 - 5 = -4\) (-4 is divisible by 2)

However, the program will output 2, because it incorrectly counts pairs based on the mod values without ensuring both conditions are met simultaneously.
