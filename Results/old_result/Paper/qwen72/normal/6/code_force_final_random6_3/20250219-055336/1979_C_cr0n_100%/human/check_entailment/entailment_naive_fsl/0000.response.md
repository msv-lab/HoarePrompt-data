Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same. According to the problem description, if all multipliers are the same, it is impossible to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. However, the program does not check for this condition and may output a solution that does not meet the requirements.

For example, consider the test case:
```
2
5
5 5 5 5 5
```

The program will output:
```
1 1 1 1 1
```

However, the total amount of coins bet is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 \) coins, and if any outcome wins, you will receive back \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) coins, which is not strictly greater than the total amount bet. Therefore, the correct output for this test case should be \(-1\), but the program does not handle this case correctly.
