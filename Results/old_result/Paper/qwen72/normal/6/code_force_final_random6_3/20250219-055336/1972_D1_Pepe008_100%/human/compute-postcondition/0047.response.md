The value of `x` is calculated as \((a - 2 \times (2 - 1)) // 2^2 + 1\). This simplifies to \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\). The value of `suma` is incremented by the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `x` is \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\), `i` is 2, `suma` is increased by \((a - 2) // 4 + 1\).**
