Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is `n-1`, `a` is the smallest integer in `l`, `b` is the second smallest integer in `l` (if it exists), and `c` is the count of integers in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.**

The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `l` to contain integers provided by the user, splitting the input string by spaces and converting each part to an integer. The other variables (`int(input())`, `_`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `b`, `c`) remain unchanged, but `a`, `b`, and `c` will be recalculated based on the new list `l`.
