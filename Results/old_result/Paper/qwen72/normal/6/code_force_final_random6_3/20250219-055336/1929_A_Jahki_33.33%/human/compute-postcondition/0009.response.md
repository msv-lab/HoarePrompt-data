Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `num2` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 <= num2 <= 500, `i` is 3, `num2` must be greater than 3, and if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to `a[1]`, `order` is 2. Otherwise, if `a[1]` is greater than `a[2]`, `order` is 3.**
