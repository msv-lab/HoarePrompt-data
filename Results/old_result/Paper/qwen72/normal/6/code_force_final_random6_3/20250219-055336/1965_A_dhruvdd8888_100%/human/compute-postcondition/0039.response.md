Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has at least 3 elements, each element in `nums` is now 0, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums` before the loop, `i` is 1, and `nw` is the same as the last value of `cw`. If `cw` is True, `nums[1]` is not equal to 1. If `cw` is False, `nums[1]` is 1.***
