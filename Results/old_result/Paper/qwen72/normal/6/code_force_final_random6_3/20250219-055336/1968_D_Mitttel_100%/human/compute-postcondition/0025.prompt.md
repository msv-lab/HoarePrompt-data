You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and p are lists of integers of the same length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), where each element of p is a distinct integer from 1 to n, and each element of a is an integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). s is a list of two integers [P_B, P_S] representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively, where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n. k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) representing the number of turns in the game.
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        
        cur += a[s]
        
        k -= 1
        
        s = p[s]
        
    #State: The loop terminates when either `k` reaches 0 or `vis[s]` becomes 1. At this point, `a` and `p` remain unchanged, `s` is the position where the loop terminates, `k` is the remaining number of turns (which could be 0), `n` remains unchanged, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` observed during the loop execution, `cur` is the sum of the elements of `a` at the positions visited during the loop, and `vis` is a list where the elements at the positions visited by the loop are set to 1.
    return mx
    #The program returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` observed during the loop execution, where `cur` is the sum of the elements of `a` at the positions visited during the loop, `k` is the remaining number of turns (which could be 0), and `a[s]` is the element of the list `a` at the position `s` where the loop terminates.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `a` of integers, a list `p` of distinct integers, a list `s` of two starting positions, and a positive integer `k` representing the number of turns. It returns the maximum value of the sum of the elements of `a` at the positions visited during the loop plus the product of the remaining number of turns and the element of `a` at the final position.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` observed during the loop execution, where `cur` is the sum of the elements of `a` at the positions visited during the loop, `k` is the remaining number of turns (which could be 0), and `a[s]` is the element of the list `a` at the position `s` where the loop terminates.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
