Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This is appropriate for the given input format.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if the digits form a stair by using the condition `a < b < c`. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - The program checks if the digits form a peak by using the condition `a < b and b > c`. If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "NONE".

3. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions described in the problem statement. The output format matches the expected output.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where all digits are the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), which should result in "NONE".
   - The program also handles cases where the digits are in descending order (e.g., `3 2 1`), which should result in "NONE".

5. **Constraints**:
   - The program adheres to the constraints \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) and \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\).

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
