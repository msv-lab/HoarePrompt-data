Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `s1` and `s2` are input strings, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 2, and `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus 1 if `s1[0]` is '1' and `s2[0]` is '0'. If `hd` > 0, `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 2` and remains greater than -1, and the rest of the current iteration is skipped. Otherwise, `hd` remains unchanged and `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus 1 if `s1[0]` is '1' and `s2[0]` is '0'.***
