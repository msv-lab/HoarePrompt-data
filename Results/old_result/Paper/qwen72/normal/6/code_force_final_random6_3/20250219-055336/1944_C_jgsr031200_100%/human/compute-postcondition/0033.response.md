Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`.
   - The length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5.
   - `freq` is a list where each element at index `i` corresponds to the number of times the integer `i` appears in `arr`.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `cou` remains 1.
   - If `freq[2]` is 1, `cou` is updated to 2.
   - If `freq[2]` is greater than or equal to 2, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement after the loop.
   - Otherwise, the program continues without any changes.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2 in the initial state.
   - The value of `i` is not modified in the given code snippet.
   - The `print` statement will simply output the value of `i`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The value of `i` is 2.
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `i`.

Output: **2**
