Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `x` is infinity, `b` is a list containing the integer `lit[i]`, `y` is the last element of `b`, `y` is less than `lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b.append(lit[i])` adds the integer at the index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`.
- Since `i` is 0, the first element of `lit` is added to `b`.
- The value of `y` is updated to the last element of `b`, which is now `lit[i]`.
- The value of `x` remains infinity because `a` is still an empty list.
- The conditions `y` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x` are still valid, but `y` now has a specific value equal to `lit[i]`.
