Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `p` is a list where the first element is `n`, the second element is `n - 2`, and the rest are zeros, `ind` is equal to `n - 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 2.
- The list `p` initially has the first element as `n` and the rest as zeros. After the code `p[i] = ind` is executed, the second element (index 1) of `p` is updated to `n - 2`.
- The value of `ind` remains `n - 2`.
