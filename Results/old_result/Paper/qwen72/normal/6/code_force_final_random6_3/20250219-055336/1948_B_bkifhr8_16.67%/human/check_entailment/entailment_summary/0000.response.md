### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to determine if it's possible to make an array sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying an operation that splits any element greater than or equal to 10 into its constituent digits and inserts them back into the array in the same position.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.
   - It then iterates through the array to check if any element is greater than the next element and is also greater than 10. If such an element is found, it splits the element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.
   - After processing the array, it calls `func_1` to check if the array is sorted.
   - `func_1` checks if the list is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version.

3. **Issues with the Program**:
   - **Single Pass Limitation**: The program only performs the splitting operation once in a single pass through the array. This is insufficient because the operation might need to be applied multiple times to achieve a sorted array. For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the first pass will split `12` into `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, but it won't split `45` or `67` in subsequent passes.
   - **Incorrect Insertion Logic**: The program splits an element and inserts the digits back into the array, but it does not recheck the array after the insertion. This means that the array might still be unsorted after the operation, and the program will incorrectly conclude that the array is sorted.
   - **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the array might need multiple splits to become sorted. For example, `[28, 12, 5]` requires multiple splits to become `[2, 8, 1, 2, 5]`.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program is **incorrect** because it does not ensure that the array is fully sorted after applying the operation multiple times. It only checks the array once after a single pass, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as described.

### Correctness: **False**
