To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `tickets_bought < k`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9).
- `prices` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.
- `pq` is a heap with one less element than before.
- `total_cost` is now `price * tickets_to_buy`.
- `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`.
- `price` is the smallest price in the heap before the operation plus `price_increase`.
- `day` is the index of this smallest price in the `prices` list.
- `price_increase` is `tickets_to_buy`.
- `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)` before the operation.

The loop condition `tickets_bought < k` must be true for the loop to execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `tickets_bought` was updated to `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`. For the loop to execute again, `tickets_bought` must still be less than `k`.

Since `tickets_bought` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `tickets_bought` is less than `k` for the next iteration. The state of `tickets_bought` at the end of the previous iteration is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`, which means that `tickets_bought` has been incremented by the number of tickets bought in the previous iteration.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to maintain the condition that `tickets_bought` is less than `k`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed to `tickets_bought` or `k` for the loop to proceed, as the condition is already satisfied by the state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. `pq` is a heap with one less element than before. `total_cost` is now `price * tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`. `price` is the smallest price in the heap before the operation plus `price_increase`. `day` is the index of this smallest price in the `prices` list. `price_increase` is `tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)` before the operation.**
