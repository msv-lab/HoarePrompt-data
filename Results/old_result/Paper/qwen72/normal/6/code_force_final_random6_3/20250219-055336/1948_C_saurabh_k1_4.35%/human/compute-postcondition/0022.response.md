Postcondition: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input. If the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is not the string `"<"`.**
