Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values of the first four integers read from the standard input, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the first and last columns being 0. `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of applying `func_1` to the corresponding row in `rows` with the parameter `d`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet creates a new list `costs` by applying the function `func_1` to each row in the list `rows`, passing `d` as an additional argument.
- The length of `costs` is equal to the number of rows in `rows`, which is `n`.
- Each element in `costs` is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged.
- The structure of `rows` remains unchanged, but the specific values in `costs` depend on the implementation of `func_1` and the values in `rows` and `d`.
