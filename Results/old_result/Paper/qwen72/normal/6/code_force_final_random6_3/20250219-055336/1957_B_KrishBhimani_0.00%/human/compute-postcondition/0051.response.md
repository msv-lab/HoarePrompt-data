Output State: **`arr` is an empty list, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1`, `k0` is the second integer from `l1`, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `ans` is a list containing the elements `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`, and if `c` is equal to `n - 1`, the last element in `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)` before the final append, `c` is equal to `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking early, otherwise `c` is less than `n - 1`, `ans` has been extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k0` is set to be the same as `k`, which is the second integer from `l1`.
- The initial state of `arr` being an empty list, `n` being the first integer from `l1`, `k` being the second integer from `l1`, and `int(input())` being greater than 1 remains unchanged.
- The conditions and logic for populating `ans` and the value of `c` remain as described in the initial state.
