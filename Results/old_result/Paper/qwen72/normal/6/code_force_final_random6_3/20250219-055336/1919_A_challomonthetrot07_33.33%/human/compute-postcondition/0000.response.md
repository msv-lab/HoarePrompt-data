Output State: **`T` is an input integer, and it represents the number of test cases. The function should take two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, `T`, is an integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 1000. However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func(T, test_cases):` where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers (a, b).**
