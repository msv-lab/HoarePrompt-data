The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `b`. For the loop to execute, `b` must be at least 1. The variable `i` is not explicitly initialized before the loop, but it will start from 1 as specified in the loop range. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `b` is at least 1.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is 0**
