The function `func_2` does not take any parameters but reads input from the standard input. The first line of input contains four integers: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, where:
- `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100` (indicating the number of rows and a specific row index),
- `3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5` (indicating the number of columns),
- `1 ≤ d ≤ m` (indicating a specific column index).

The next `n` lines each contain `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, where:
- `0 ≤ a_{i, j} ≤ 10^6` (indicating the depth values),
- `a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0` (indicating that the first and last columns of each row are always 0).

The function processes this input and returns a value based on the input data.

Functionality: **The function reads input from the standard input, which includes four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, followed by `n` lines of `m` integers representing the depths of river cells. It returns a value based on the input data.**
