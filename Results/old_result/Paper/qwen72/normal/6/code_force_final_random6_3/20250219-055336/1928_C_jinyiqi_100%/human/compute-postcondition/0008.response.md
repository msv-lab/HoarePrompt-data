Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is a list containing `[1, 2]` if `x` is divisible by `1`, otherwise `output1` is a list containing `[2]`. `output2` is a list containing `[x]` if `x` is divisible by `1`, otherwise `output2` remains an empty list. `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `output1.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `output1`.
- If `x` is divisible by `1`, `output1` initially contains `[1]`, so after appending `2`, `output1` becomes `[1, 2]`.
- If `x` is not divisible by `1`, `output1` initially remains an empty list, so after appending `2`, `output1` becomes `[2]`.
- The value of `output2` remains unchanged, as it is only affected by the initial condition of `x` being divisible by `1`.
- The value of `i` remains `2`.
