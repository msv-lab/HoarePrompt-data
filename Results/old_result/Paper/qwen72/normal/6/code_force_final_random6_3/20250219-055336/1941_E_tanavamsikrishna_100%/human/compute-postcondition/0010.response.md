Output State: **`n` must be at least `k`, `i` is `n - k + 1`, `costs` is a list of length `n`, `total_costs` is a list with `n - k + 1` elements, where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements in `costs`, starting from index `0` to `n - k`.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The value of `n` must still be at least `k` for the loop to have executed.
- The loop variable `i` will have reached the value `n - k + 1`, which is the last valid index for the loop to execute.
- The `costs` list remains unchanged with a length of `n`.
- The `total_costs` list will have `n - k + 1` elements, where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list, starting from the first element and ending at the element at index `n - k`.
