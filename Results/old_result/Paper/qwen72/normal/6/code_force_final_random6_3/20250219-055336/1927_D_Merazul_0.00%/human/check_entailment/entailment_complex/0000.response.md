Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description Mismatch**: The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem requires finding a pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a given range \([l, r]\) such that \(a_i \ne a_j\). However, the provided program is checking if every integer from 1 to \(k\) is present in either of two sets `a` and `b`, and it calculates the number of integers in `a` but not in `b` and vice versa. This is fundamentally different from the problem's requirements.

2. **Functionality Mismatch**: The program reads two sets of integers `a` and `b` and processes them to check for the presence of integers from 1 to \(k\). It does not handle the array `a` and the queries \((l, r)\) as described in the problem. The logic for finding pairs of indices \(i\) and \(j\) within the range \([l, r]\) is completely absent.

3. **Input Handling**: The program uses a lambda function `R` to read input, but it does not correctly handle the input format as described in the problem. Specifically, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` in a way that does not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Output Mismatch**: The program outputs "YES" or "NO" based on the presence of integers in the sets `a` and `b`, which is not the expected output format. The problem requires outputting indices \(i\) and \(j\) or \(-1 -1\) if no such pair exists.

Given these significant mismatches, the provided program is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
