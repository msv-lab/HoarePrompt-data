The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, and an additional parameter `t` which represents the number of test cases. Each of `n` and `k` are positive integers with the constraint 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and `t` is an integer with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.

The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each case. Since the output is not specified, we can infer that the function returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not clear from the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18). The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
