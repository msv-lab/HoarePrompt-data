Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `path` is a list that includes all vertices from the initial `remaining_vertices` set.
- `remaining_vertices` is an empty set.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f"! {' '.join(map(str, path))}")
```

### Analysis:
1. **`n`**: This is an integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\). The exact value of `n` is not specified, but it is known to be within this range.
2. **`path`**: This list contains all vertices from the initial `remaining_vertices` set. Since `remaining_vertices` is initially an empty set, and `path` includes all vertices from this set, `path` must also be an empty list.
3. **`remaining_vertices`**: This is an empty set, as stated in the initial state.

### Execution of the `print` Statement:
- The `print` statement uses an f-string to format the output.
- `map(str, path)` converts each element in the `path` list to a string.
- `' '.join(map(str, path))` joins these string elements with a space.
- Since `path` is an empty list, `map(str, path)` will also be an empty list, and `' '.join(map(str, path))` will result in an empty string.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `"! "` followed by an empty string.

Output: **!**
