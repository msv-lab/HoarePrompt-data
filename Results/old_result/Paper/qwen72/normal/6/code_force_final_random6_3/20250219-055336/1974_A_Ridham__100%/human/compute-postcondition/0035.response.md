Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, `screen_require_for_y` is the same as in the initial state, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` is equal to `x * 1 - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)`, `extra_screen` is equal to `(x * 1 - (15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4)) // 15`.** 

The code snippet `extra_screen = extra_space // 15` calculates the integer division of `extra_space` by 15 and assigns the result to `extra_screen`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `extra_screen` is now the integer part of the division of `extra_space` by 15.
