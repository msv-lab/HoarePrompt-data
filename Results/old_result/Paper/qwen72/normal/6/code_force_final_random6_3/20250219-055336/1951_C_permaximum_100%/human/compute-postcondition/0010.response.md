Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. `pq` is a heap with one less element than before. `total_cost` is now `price * tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`. `price` is the smallest price in the heap before the operation plus `price_increase`. `day` is the index of this smallest price in the `prices` list. `price_increase` is 0. `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)` before the operation.**

In natural language: The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `pq`, `price`, `day`, and `price_increase` remain unchanged. The variable `tickets_bought` is incremented by the value of `tickets_to_buy`, which was previously set to `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`. The variable `total_cost` is still `price * tickets_to_buy`. The value of `tickets_to_buy` before the operation is also `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`.
