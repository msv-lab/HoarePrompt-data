Precondition: **The function should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates are within the range -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and the square has a positive area with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.**

However, the provided function definition is incomplete. For a more accurate function definition, it should be:

```python
def func(test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of lists, each inner list containing four tuples representing the coordinates of the square's corners.
