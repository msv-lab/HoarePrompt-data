### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others.
   - Universals can be in a tent with any number of people (1, 2, or 3).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers.
   - **Output:** The function returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate extroverts and universals, or `None` if it's impossible.
   - **Logic:**
     - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it means there are some extroverts that cannot form complete groups of 3.
     - If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to complete the last group of 3 for the extroverts, making it impossible to accommodate all extroverts.
     - If the above condition is not met, the function returns the ceiling of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`, which is the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the remaining extroverts and universals.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` are non-negative integers.
   - **Output:** The function returns the total number of tents needed, or -1 if it's impossible to accommodate all participants.
   - **Logic:**
     - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to determine the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
     - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
     - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts (each requiring a tent) and the number of tents returned by `func_1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Case 1:** `1 2 3`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 2 (2 extroverts + 1 universal = 1 tent)
     - Universals: 3 (2 universals = 1 tent)
     - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 1 (extroverts + 1 universal) + 1 (2 universals) = 3
   - **Case 2:** `1 4 1`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 4 (4 extroverts + 0 universals = 2 tents, but 1 extrovert is left without a pair)
     - Universals: 1 (not enough to form a complete group with the remaining extrovert)
     - Total tents: -1 (impossible)
   - **Case 3:** `1 4 2`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 4 (4 extroverts + 2 universals = 2 tents)
     - Universals: 2 (0 universals left)
     - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts + 2 universals) = 3
   - **Case 4:** `1 1 1`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 1 (1 extrovert + 0 universals = 1 tent, but 2 more people are needed)
     - Universals: 1 (not enough to form a complete group with the remaining extrovert)
     - Total tents: -1 (impossible)
   - **Case 5:** `1 3 2`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 3 (3 extroverts + 0 universals = 1 tent)
     - Universals: 2 (2 universals = 1 tent)
     - Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 1 (extroverts) + 1 (2 universals) = 3
   - **Case 6:** `19 7 18`
     - Introverts: 19 (19 tents)
     - Extroverts: 7 (7 extroverts + 2 universals = 3 tents, 16 universals left)
     - Universals: 18 (16 universals = 6 tents, 2 universals left)
     - Total tents: 19 (introverts) + 3 (extroverts + 2 universals) + 6 (16 universals) = 28
   - **Case 7:** `0 0 0`
     - No participants, so no tents are needed.
     - Total tents: 0
   - **Case 8:** `7 0 0`
     - Introverts: 7 (7 tents)
     - Extroverts: 0 (0 tents)
     - Universals: 0 (0 tents)
     - Total tents: 7 (introverts) + 0 (extroverts) + 0 (universals) = 7
   - **Case 9:** `0 24 0`
     - Introverts: 0 (0 tents)
     - Extroverts: 24 (24 extroverts = 8 tents)
     - Universals: 0 (0 tents)
     - Total tents: 0 (introverts) + 8 (extroverts) + 0 (universals) = 8
   - **Case 10:** `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
     - Introverts: 1000000000 (1000000000 tents)
     - Extroverts: 1000000000 (1000000000 extroverts + 0 universals = 333333334 tents, 1000000000 - 3 * 333333334 = 2 universals left)
     - Universals: 1000000000 (2 universals = 1 tent, 999999998 universals = 333333333 tents)
     - Total tents: 1000000000 (introverts) + 333333334 (extroverts) + 333333333 (universals) = 1666666667

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly handles all the edge cases and the logic is sound.
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if it's possible to form complete groups of 3 for extroverts and universals.
   - The function `func_2` correctly calculates the total number of tents needed by adding the number of introverts to the result of `func_1`.
