Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet).
  - `_` is 0 (though `_` is not used in the code snippet).
  - `n` is an input integer (though `n` is not used in the code snippet).
  - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.

- **Code Snippet:**
  ```python
  print(nums[0] + nums[1])
  ```

- **Explanation:**
  - `nums[0]` is the first element of the list `nums`, which is the largest integer in the list because `nums` is sorted in descending order.
  - `nums[1]` is the second element of the list `nums`, which is the second largest integer in the list because `nums` is sorted in descending order.
  - The `print` statement will output the sum of the largest and second largest integers in the list `nums`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the sum of the two largest integers in the list `nums`.

Output: **nums[0] + nums[1] (where nums[0] is the largest integer and nums[1] is the second largest integer in the list `nums`)**
