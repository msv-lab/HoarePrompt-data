The function `func` is expected to be called within a loop or context that handles multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 (free cell) or 1 (cell with a chip), and at least one cell contains a chip. The function returns the minimum number of moves required to move all chips to the same cell.

Functionality: **The function accepts a test case consisting of an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. It returns the minimum number of moves required to move all chips to the same cell.**
