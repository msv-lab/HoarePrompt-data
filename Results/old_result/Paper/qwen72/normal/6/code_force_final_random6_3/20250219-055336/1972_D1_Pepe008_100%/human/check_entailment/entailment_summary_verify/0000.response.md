### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the function summary to evaluate the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases `T` and then processes each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then calculates a sum `suma` based on a specific formula and prints `suma - 2` for each test case.

#### Key Points in the Program:
1. **Input Reading:**
   ```python
   T = int(input())
   for t in range(T):
       info = input().split()
       (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
   ```
   This part correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `a` and `b` for each test case.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   ```python
   suma = 0
   for i in range(1, b + 1):
       x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
       if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
           suma += x
           if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
               suma += 1
   ```
   This part is where the logic for counting the valid pairs is implemented. Let's analyze the formula and conditions used:
   - `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`
     - This formula is intended to count the number of valid `a` values for a given `b` (where `b` is represented by `i` in the loop).
     - The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) is not directly related to the problem's condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).
   - `if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:`
     - This condition checks if `x` is positive, which is necessary for adding `x` to `suma`.
   - `if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:`
     - This condition checks if \((a - i * (i - 1))\) and \((i * (i - 1))\) are multiples of \(i^2\). This is not a valid condition for the problem's requirement.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary correctly describes the input and output behavior of the program. However, it does not provide insight into the correctness of the logic used to count the valid pairs.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program's logic is incorrect and does not align with the problem's requirements. This is accurate because:
- The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) does not correctly count the valid pairs.
- The additional modulo conditions are not relevant to the problem's condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. For each pair, calculate \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count and print the number of valid pairs for each test case.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem as described. The formula and conditions used in the program do not align with the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
