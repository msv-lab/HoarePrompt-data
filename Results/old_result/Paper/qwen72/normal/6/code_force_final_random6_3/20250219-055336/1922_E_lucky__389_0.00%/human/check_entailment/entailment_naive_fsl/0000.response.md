Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `X` is a power of 2. For example, if `X = 4`, the program will output an incorrect result. According to the problem description, an array with exactly 4 increasing subsequences should be possible, but the program fails to generate such an array. Instead, it incorrectly subtracts 1 from `X` and then tries to find an array for `X - 1`, which leads to an incorrect solution. The program should handle the case where `X` is a power of 2 correctly by generating an appropriate array.
