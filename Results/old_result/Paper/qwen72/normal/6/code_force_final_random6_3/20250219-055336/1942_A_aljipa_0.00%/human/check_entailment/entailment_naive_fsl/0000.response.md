Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where \( k \) is between 2 and \( n-1 \). The problem description requires that exactly \( k \) out of the \( n \) cyclic shifts of the array should be sorted. The current program only handles the cases where \( k = n \) (all cyclic shifts are sorted) and \( k = 1 \) (only one cyclic shift is sorted). For other values of \( k \), the program incorrectly outputs `-1`.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4 2
```
The program will output:
```
-1
```
However, a valid array for this input could be:
```
1 2 3 1
```
The cyclic shifts of this array are:
- [1, 2, 3, 1] (sorted)
- [2, 3, 1, 1] (sorted)
- [3, 1, 1, 2] (not sorted)
- [1, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted)

Thus, exactly 2 out of the 4 cyclic shifts are sorted, which satisfies the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
