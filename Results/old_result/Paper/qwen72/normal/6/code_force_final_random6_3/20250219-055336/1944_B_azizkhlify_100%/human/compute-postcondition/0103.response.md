Postcondition: ***`res` must contain all the elements that were processed and had `l[a[i] - 1]` equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `i` is the last element of `res` + 2, and `i` must be less than `2 * n`. If `ul == ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0 and `ur` is incremented by 2.***
