### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The sum of the array is to be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(number)`:**
     - This function takes an integer `number` and returns the remainder when `number` is divided by \(10^9 + 7\).
     - This is a standard operation to handle large numbers and ensure the result fits within the specified range.
     - **Correctness:** This function is correct as it performs the required modulo operation.

   - **`func_2(arr)`:**
     - This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers in the array `arr`.
     - The function maintains a `max_segment` to track the maximum sum found and a `new_segment` to track the current segment being considered.
     - The function iterates through the array and updates `max_segment` and `new_segment` based on the current element.
     - After the loop, it appends the final segments to `segments_variants` and then finds the segment with the highest sum.
     - **Correctness:** The function is not correctly implemented. It does not handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers, and it incorrectly appends the `new_segment` and `max_segment` to `segments_variants` even if they are empty or invalid. Additionally, the function returns `[-1]` if no valid segment is found, which is not the correct approach for the problem.

   - **`func_3(number, quantity)`:**
     - This function is not used in the provided code and does not contribute to the solution.
     - **Correctness:** This function is irrelevant to the problem and can be ignored.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic of the program involves:
     - Reading the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, reading the array `a` and the number of operations `k`.
     - Calling `func_2(a)` to find the maximum segment sum.
     - If the maximum segment sum is `-1`, it sets the segment sum to `0`.
     - Computes the final answer using the formula: `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
     - Prints the result after applying `func_1` to the answer.
   - **Correctness:** The main logic is flawed because `func_2` does not correctly find the maximum segment sum, especially in cases where the array contains only negative numbers or no valid segments are found.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because the function `func_2` does not correctly handle the scenario where the array contains only negative numbers or no valid segments are found. This leads to incorrect results in the main logic.

**Correctness: False**
