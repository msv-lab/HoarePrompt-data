Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    if k == 0:
        break
    if l == r:
        if k >= a[r]:
            sunks += 1
            break
        break
    if a[l] <= a[r]:
        if k >= a[l] * 2:
            k -= a[l] * 2
            a[r] -= a[l]
            if a[r] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
            continue
        elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break
    if k == 0:
        break
    if a[r] < a[l]:
        if k >= a[r] * 2:
            k -= a[r] * 2
            a[l] -= a[r]
            if a[l] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
            continue
        elif a[r] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2 depending on the initial values and updates within the if block, `sunks` is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on the initial value and updates within the if block. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, and `k` is greater than or equal to twice the current value of `a[r]`, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`, `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[l]` was 0, `l` is updated to 1 or 2, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `k` is less than `a[r] * 2` but `a[r] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `sunks` remains 0. In all cases, the program either continues to the next iteration of the loop or breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0, 1, 1, or 2, `r` is n - 1, n - 2, n - 2, or n - 3 depending on the initial values and updates within the if block, `sunks` is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 depending on the initial value and updates within the if block. If `a[r] < a[l]`, and if `k` >= `a[r] * 2`, then `k` is updated to `k - a[r] * 2`, `r` is updated to `r - 1`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`. If `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. In all cases, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without any changes to `k`, `r`, `sunks`, or `a[l]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `l` is 0, 1, 1, or 2, `r` is n - 1, n - 2, n - 2, or n - 3, and `sunks` is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. If `a[r] < a[l]`, the values of `l`, `r`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `sunks` remain unchanged. If `a[r] >= a[l]` and `k` >= `a[l] * 2`, `l` is updated to 1, 2, 2, or 3, `sunks` is updated to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10, `k` is updated to `k - a[l-1] * 2`, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l-1]`. If `a[r]` == 0 after the update, `r` is updated to n - 2, n - 3, n - 3, or n - 4, and `sunks` is updated to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11. If `l` == `r` and `k` >= `a[r]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` < `a[l] * 2` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` == 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
