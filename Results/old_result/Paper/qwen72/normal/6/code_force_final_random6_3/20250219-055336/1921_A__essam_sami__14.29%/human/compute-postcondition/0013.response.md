The only objects in the loop head are the variables `steps` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `steps` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and `steps` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `steps` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than `steps`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `steps` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are integers provided by the user, `n` is equal to (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f), `x` is equal to (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h). If `x` > `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.**
