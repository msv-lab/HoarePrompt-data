Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, and `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`.** 

In natural language: The value of `a[r]` is updated to be `a[r] - mi`, where `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
