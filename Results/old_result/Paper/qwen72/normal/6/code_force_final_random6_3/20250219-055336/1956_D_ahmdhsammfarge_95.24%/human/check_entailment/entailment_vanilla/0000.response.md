Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).
   - We can perform an operation that sets a subarray `a[l:r+1]` to the MEX of that subarray.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array `a` using no more than 5 * 10^5 operations.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(lst)`**:
   - This function aims to find the optimal subarray `[l, r]` that, when replaced by its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array.
   - It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential new sum if the subarray `[i, j]` is replaced by its MEX.
   - The MEX of a subarray is approximated by `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is incorrect. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not the square of the subarray length.
   - The function returns the indices of the optimal subarray and the maximum possible sum.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`**:
   - This function recursively adds operations to the list `ops` to set the subarray `[r, l]` to the MEX of the subarray.
   - It seems to be intended to add operations to set the subarray to the MEX, but the logic is flawed. It does not correctly compute the MEX and does not handle the subarray replacement correctly.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**:
   - This function is supposed to set the subarray `[r, l]` to the MEX of the subarray and update the operations list `ops`.
   - It appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops`.
   - It checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0 and appends the operation again if true.
   - It then appends the operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` and recursively calls `func_2`.
   - Finally, it sets the subarray `[r, l]` to the length of the subarray.
   - The logic for computing the MEX and the recursive calls are incorrect and do not align with the problem requirements.

5. **Overall Program**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the MEX of a subarray.
   - The recursive functions `func_2` and `func_3` do not correctly handle the subarray replacement and the operations.
   - The program does not ensure that the sum is maximized or that the operations are valid according to the problem constraints.

Correctness: **False**
