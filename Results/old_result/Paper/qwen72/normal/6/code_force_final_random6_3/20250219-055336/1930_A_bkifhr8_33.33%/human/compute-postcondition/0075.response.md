Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `t` is greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans` (now with an additional element), `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` has the first and third elements removed, and `ans` remains 0. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the sum of the original `ans` (which was 0) and the minimum of the two integers obtained by converting the substrings in `lst` to integers, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
