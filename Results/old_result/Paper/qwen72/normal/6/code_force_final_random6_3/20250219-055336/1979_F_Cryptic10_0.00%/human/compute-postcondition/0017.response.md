Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 2`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `remaining_vertices` no longer includes the current value of `v`, and `path` is a list that now includes the current value of `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the program also continues to the next iteration of the loop. The value `v` has been appended to the list `path`.**
