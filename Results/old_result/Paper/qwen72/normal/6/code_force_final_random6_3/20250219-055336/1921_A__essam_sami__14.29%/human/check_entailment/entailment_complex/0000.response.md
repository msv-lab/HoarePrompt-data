Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the area of a square given its corner coordinates. However, the approach taken in the program is flawed. The program calculates the squared distances between two pairs of points for each test case and then prints the smaller of the two. This method does not guarantee that the correct area of the square will be found.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Distance Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the squared distances `n` and `x` between the first and third pairs of points, and the second and fourth pairs of points, respectively. This is not a reliable way to determine the side length of the square, as the points are given in random order.
   - The correct approach would be to find the unique x-coordinates and y-coordinates, and then compute the side length as the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates).

2. **Comparison of Distances**:
   - The program compares the two squared distances `n` and `x` and prints the smaller one. This is incorrect because the side length of the square could be derived from either the x-coordinates or the y-coordinates, and the comparison does not ensure that the correct side length is used.

3. **Missing Calculation of Side Length**:
   - The program does not explicitly calculate the side length of the square. Instead, it relies on the squared distance, which is not a direct measure of the side length.

### Correct Approach:
- For each test case, collect all x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
- Compute the side length of the square as the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates).
- The area of the square is then the side length squared.

### Example:
For the input:
```
3
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
45 11
45 39
17 11
17 39
```
- The correct side lengths are:
  - Test case 1: Side length = 3 (since the difference in x-coordinates is 3 and the difference in y-coordinates is 3)
  - Test case 2: Side length = 2 (since the difference in x-coordinates is 2 and the difference in y-coordinates is 2)
  - Test case 3: Side length = 28 (since the difference in y-coordinates is 28 and the x-coordinates are the same)

- The correct areas are:
  - Test case 1: Area = 9
  - Test case 2: Area = 4
  - Test case 3: Area = 784

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not reliably find the side length of the square and thus does not correctly compute the area.

Correctness: **False**
