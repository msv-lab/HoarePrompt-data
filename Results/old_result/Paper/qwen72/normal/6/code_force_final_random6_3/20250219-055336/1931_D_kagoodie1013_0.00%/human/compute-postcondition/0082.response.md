Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the third tuple and must have at least 3 elements, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the value of `count` has been appended to it, `count` is now `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0) + (mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0))`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with the key `mod_x_key` and value 2, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with the key `mod_y_key` and value 2, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `mod_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `mod_y` is the result of `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is the result of `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is the result of `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `mod_x = -num % x` updates the value of `mod_x` to the result of `-num % x`.
- All other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `results`, `count`, `mod_x_map`, `mod_y_map`, `num`, `mod_y`, `mod_x_key`, `mod_y_key`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `mod_x` is now the result of `-num % x`, which is a specific calculation based on the current values of `num` and `x`.
