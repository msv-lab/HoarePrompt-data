### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The variable `t` is set to `b * 2`, which represents the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons.
   - The function then calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons by dividing `t` by 5 and adding 1 if there is a remainder. This is correct because each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns), and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Therefore, `b * 2` gives the total number of cells needed for 2x2 icons, and dividing by 5 gives the number of screens needed, with an additional screen if there is a remainder.

3. **Remaining Cells for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The variable `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which represents the total number of cells available on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, it means there are enough cells left to place all the 1x1 icons, and the number of screens `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, the function calculates the additional number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. This is done by setting `t2` to `a - t1` and then adding the necessary screens to `t`.

4. **Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The function correctly calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons by dividing `t2` by 15 and adding 1 if there is a remainder. This is because each screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The logic for calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons and then for the remaining 1x1 icons is sound.
- The function correctly handles the edge cases and ensures that the minimum number of screens is used.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
