Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `N` from the input, representing the number of elements, and then reads a list of `N` integers from the input. It processes these integers to determine the winner of a game (Alice or Bob) based on the final state of the list after a series of operations. The function does not modify the `test_cases` list or return any value; instead, it prints the name of the winner ('Alice' or 'Bob') based on the game's outcome. The game's outcome is determined by the final state of the list, where if the second smallest number in the list is 1, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. **
