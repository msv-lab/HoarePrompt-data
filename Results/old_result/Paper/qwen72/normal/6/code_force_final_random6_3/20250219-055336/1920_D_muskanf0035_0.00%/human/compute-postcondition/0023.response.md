Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a list of tuples with `n` tuples, `array` is a list that contains the elements added by the operations in `operations` and possibly repeated based on the `op_type` values, `result` is a list containing the elements at indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`, `op_type` is the last tuple's `op_type` in `operations`, `value` is the last tuple's `value` in `operations`, `queries` is a non-empty list.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The variable `n` remains a positive integer.
- The variable `operations` remains a list of tuples with `n` tuples.
- The variable `array` remains a list that contains the elements added by the operations in `operations`, possibly repeated based on the `op_type` values.
- The variable `result` is now a list containing the elements from `array` at the indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in the `queries` list.
- The variables `op_type` and `value` remain unchanged, still holding the values from the last tuple in `operations`.
- The variable `queries` is a non-empty list, and the loop has processed all its elements.
