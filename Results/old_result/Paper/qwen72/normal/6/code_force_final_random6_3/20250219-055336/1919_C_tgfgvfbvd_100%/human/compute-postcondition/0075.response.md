Postcondition: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 2, and `c` is 0 or 1. If `l[2]` is less than or equal to `b`, `b` is `l[2]`. If `a` > `b`, `a` and `b` have swapped their values. Otherwise, `a` and `b` retain their original values. If `l[2]` is greater than `b`, `c` is 1 or 2, `a` is `l[2]`. If `a` > `b`, `a` and `b` have swapped their values. Otherwise, `a` and `b` retain their original values.**
