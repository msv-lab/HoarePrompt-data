Let's break down the initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\) and \(x \neq y\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `m` is an input integer greater than 0 and `m` is odd.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `k` is not a power of 2.

2. **Python Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is printing the integer `1`.
   - The initial state provides information about the variables `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the `print` statement will simply output the integer `1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The code will print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
