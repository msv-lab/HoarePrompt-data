Output State: **`_` is a temporary variable, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least two elements and the last two elements are equal, `l` is less than `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are equal, `end` is 1.**

The value of `end` is incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
