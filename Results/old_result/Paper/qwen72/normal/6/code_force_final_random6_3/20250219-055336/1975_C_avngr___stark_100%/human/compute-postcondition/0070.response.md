The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for `i` to be less than `n - 2`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, and `max` is either the second element of `temp` if `temp[1]` is greater than the initial value of `max`, or remains the same as the initial value of `max`. `temp` is a sorted list of the first three elements of `a` starting from index 1.**
