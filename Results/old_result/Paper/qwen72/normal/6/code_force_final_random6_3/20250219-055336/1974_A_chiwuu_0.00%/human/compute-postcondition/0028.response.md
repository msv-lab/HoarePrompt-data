Output State: **`a` is an integer representing the first value input by the user, `b` is an integer representing the second value input by the user, `t` is `b * 2 // 5`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1.**

The value of `t` has been updated to `b * 2 // 5`, which means `t` is now the integer division of `b * 2` by 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
