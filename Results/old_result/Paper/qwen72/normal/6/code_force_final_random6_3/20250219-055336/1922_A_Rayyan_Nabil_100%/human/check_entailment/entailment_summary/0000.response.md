### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not.
   - A string `s` matches the template `t` if for each index `i`:
     - If `t[i]` is lowercase, `s[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`.
     - If `t[i]` is uppercase, `s[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` checks for each index `i` if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - If this condition is true for any index `i`, it returns 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
   - This function is designed to check if there is at least one position where both `a` and `b` differ from `c`, which is a necessary condition for the template to exist.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the list `results`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if there is at least one position where both `a` and `b` differ from `c`. This is a valid condition to ensure that `a` and `b` can match a template while `c` cannot.
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
   - The output format matches the problem description, printing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it meets the problem description and handles the input and output as specified.

Correctness: **True**
