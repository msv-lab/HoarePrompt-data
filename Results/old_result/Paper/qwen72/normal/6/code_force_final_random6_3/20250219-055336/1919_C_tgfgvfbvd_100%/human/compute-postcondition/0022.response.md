Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is 1, `a` is `l[1]`, `b` is infinity, and `c` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = l[x]` updates the value of `a` to `l[1]` (since `x` is 1).
- The value of `b` remains infinity.
- The value of `c` is 0, as the code snippet provided does not change `c`.
- The values of `int(input())`, `_`, `n`, `l`, and `x` remain unchanged from the initial state.
