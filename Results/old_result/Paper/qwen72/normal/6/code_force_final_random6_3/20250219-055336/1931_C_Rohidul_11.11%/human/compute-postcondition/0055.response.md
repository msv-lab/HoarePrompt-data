The value of `end` is incremented by 1, but the states of the other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `a`, `l`, `r`, `st`, and `ans` are still valid. The specific values for `n`, `t`, and `a` are not provided, but the conditions they must satisfy are still in place.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer and `n >= 5`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is the largest index such that `a[l] == a[l + 1]` for all `l < r` and `l` is at least 3, `r` is `n - 3` and `r` must be greater than `l`, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`, and so on until `a[l - 1]` must be equal to `a[l]`, `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is `l`, `end` is 2, `ans` is the difference `r - l`.**
