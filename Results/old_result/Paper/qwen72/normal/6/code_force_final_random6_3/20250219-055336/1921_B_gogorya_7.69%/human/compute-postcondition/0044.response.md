Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 0, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`. The current value of `s1[i]` is '1' and the current value of `s2[i]` is '0'. If `hd` > 0, `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1` and the current value of `hd` is greater than or equal to 0, and the program skips the rest of the current iteration. Otherwise, `hd` remains `a1 - a2`.**
