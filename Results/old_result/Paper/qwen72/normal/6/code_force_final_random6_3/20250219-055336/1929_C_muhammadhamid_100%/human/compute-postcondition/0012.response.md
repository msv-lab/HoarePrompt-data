Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer input, `x` is an integer input, `a` is an integer input, `_` is 1, `s` is the value of `s` after `x` iterations of the loop where `s` is incremented by `s // (k - 1) + 1` in each iteration, `i` is `x - 1`, `int(input())` must be greater than `x`**

Explanation:
- The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are reassigned based on the user input provided through `input().split()`. The input values are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than `x` is still valid, but the specific value of `int(input())` is not known, only that it is greater than the new value of `x`.
- The value of `s` is still the result of `x` iterations of the loop where `s` is incremented by `s // (k - 1) + 1` in each iteration, but the new value of `k` will affect the calculation of `s` in future iterations.
- The value of `i` is still `x - 1`, but `x` has been updated to the new input value.
