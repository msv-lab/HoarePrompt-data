The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state describes the variables `_`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The condition about the element at index `n - 2` in `b` being the string `"<"` or not does not affect the execution of the `print` statement, as the statement itself does not depend on this condition.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
