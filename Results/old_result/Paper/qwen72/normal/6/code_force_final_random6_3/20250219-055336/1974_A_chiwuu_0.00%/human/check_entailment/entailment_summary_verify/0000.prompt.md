You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes `n` test cases, where `n` is an integer provided by the user. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user input. It calculates a value `t` based on `b` and updates `t` to ensure that `t * 15 - b * 4` is at least `a`. The final value of `t` for each test case is printed. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the variables `a`, `b`, and `t` are no longer relevant, and the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of 1x1 icons is such that they can be optimally placed alongside 2x2 icons on the same screen. Specifically, the program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons and then checks if the remaining space can accommodate the 1x1 icons. However, it does not consider the optimal placement of 1x1 icons alongside 2x2 icons, which can lead to an incorrect result.

For example, consider the input `x = 11` and `y = 2`. The program will calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons as `t = 2 * 2 // 5 + 1 = 1`. Then it will check if the remaining space can accommodate the 1x1 icons: `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`. Since `t1 < 11`, it will calculate the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons: `t2 = 11 - 7 = 4`, and `t = 1 + 4 // 15 + 1 = 2`. However, the correct answer should be 2 screens, as 2x2 icons can be placed in a way that leaves enough space for all 1x1 icons.

The program should consider the optimal placement of 1x1 icons alongside 2x2 icons to minimize the number of screens used.
