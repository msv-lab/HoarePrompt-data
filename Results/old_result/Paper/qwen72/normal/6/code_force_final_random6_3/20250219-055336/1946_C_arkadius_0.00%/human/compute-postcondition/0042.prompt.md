Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains the same elements as before, plus the tuple `(v, True)` at the top.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    stack.append((u, False))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains the same elements as before, plus the tuple `(v, True)` at the top, and the tuple `(u, False)` is appended to the top of `stack`. `tree.vertices[v].children` must not be empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains the same elements as before, plus the tuple `(v, True)` at the top, and the tuple `(u, False)` is appended to the top of `stack`. `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 2 elements, and `u` is the second element in `tree.vertices[v].children`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains the same elements as before, plus the tuple `(v, True)` at the top, and the tuple `(u, False)` is appended to the top of `stack`. `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 3 elements, and `u` is the third element in `tree.vertices[v].children`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
