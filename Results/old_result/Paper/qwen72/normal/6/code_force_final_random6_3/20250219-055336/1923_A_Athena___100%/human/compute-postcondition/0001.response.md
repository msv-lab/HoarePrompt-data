The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`func` is expected to be called within a loop or context that handles multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 (free cell) or 1 (cell with a chip), and at least one cell contains a chip. `t` must be greater than 0.**
