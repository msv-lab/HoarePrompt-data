Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the number of digits in the concatenated number can be determined by subtracting the number of trailing zeros in the array. However, this is not a valid approach to determine the winner of the game.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2
14 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Sasha
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Anna
```

**Explanation:**
- Anna can reverse the integer 2, which remains 2.
- Sasha then concatenates 2 and 14, resulting in 214, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). Therefore, Sasha wins.

However, the program incorrectly determines that Anna wins because it does not correctly simulate the game's turn-based logic and the conditions for winning. The program's logic for counting trailing zeros and subtracting them from the total digit count does not align with the actual game rules.
