Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a fundamental flaw in the way it handles the second type of operation, which involves appending multiple copies of the current array to itself. Specifically, the implementation in `func_1` for the second type of operation (when `op_type == 2`) is incorrect because it only appends one copy of the current array, rather than `x` copies as required by the problem description.

Here is the corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            # Append x copies of the current array to itself
            current_array = array.copy()
            for _ in range(value - 1):
                array.extend(current_array)
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result
```

However, even with this correction, the program may still be inefficient for large values of `x` and `n` because it constructs the entire array, which can grow exponentially in size. A more efficient approach would be to keep track of the lengths of the subarrays and use modular arithmetic to determine the position of the queried elements without constructing the entire array. This would significantly reduce the memory and time complexity.

Here is a more efficient version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    lengths = []
    total_length = 0
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
            total_length += 1
            lengths.append(total_length)
        else:
            current_length = lengths[-1]
            total_length += current_length * (value - 1)
            lengths.append(total_length)
    
    results = []
    for k in queries:
        while k > lengths[0]:
            k %= lengths[0]
            if k == 0:
                k = lengths[0]
            lengths.pop(0)
        results.append(array[k - 1])
    
    return results

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)
```

This version of `func_1` keeps track of the lengths of the subarrays and uses a while loop to efficiently find the position of the queried elements in the array, even for very large arrays. This approach ensures that the program can handle the constraints specified in the problem description.
