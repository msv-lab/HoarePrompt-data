The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables `n`, `f`, `k`, and the list `a` remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `f` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n, and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100.**
