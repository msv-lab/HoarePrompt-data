You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

    1 2 3

Output

    2
    4
    5
    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` takes no parameters and reads input from the user. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer provided by the user (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of books, and a list of `n` integers representing the number of pages in each book. The function sorts the list of pages in descending order and prints the sum of the two largest page counts for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and the sum of the two largest page counts for each test case has been printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input. It first reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums` for each book.

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list `nums` in descending order using `nums.sort(reverse=True)`. This ensures that the largest elements are at the beginning of the list.

3. **Sum of Top Two Elements**: The program then prints the sum of the first two elements of the sorted list `nums[0] + nums[1]`. Since the list is sorted in descending order, `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` are the two largest elements in the list.

4. **Logic for Maximum Pages**: The problem requires Alice to divide the books into two non-empty piles and read the book with the highest number of pages in each pile. By sorting the list and taking the top two elements, the program ensures that Alice reads the two books with the most pages, which is the optimal solution for maximizing the total number of pages read.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases correctly. For example, when `n = 2`, the two books are automatically the two largest, and the program will output their sum. For larger `n`, the program still correctly identifies the two largest books.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will output the maximum total number of pages Alice can read for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
