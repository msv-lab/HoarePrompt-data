Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing the elements of the original list `nums` minus the first and last elements, `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element of the original `nums`, `b` is the last element of the original `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `k` is less than 2 * `x`.**
