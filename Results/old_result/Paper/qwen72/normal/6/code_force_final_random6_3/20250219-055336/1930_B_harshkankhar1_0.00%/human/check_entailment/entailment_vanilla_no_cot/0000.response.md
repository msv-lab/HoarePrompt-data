Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Permutation Generation**: For each test case, it generates a list `a` containing the integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Permutation Modification**: The program reverses the elements at even indices (0-based) of the list `a`. This is done using the slicing and reversing operation `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]`.

4. **Output**: The modified list `a` is printed as the permutation.

### Explanation of the Permutation Modification:
- **Reversing Even Indices**: By reversing the elements at even indices, the program ensures that the permutation does not have consecutive elements where both elements at positions `i` and `i+1` are divisors of elements at positions `j` and `j+1` (for `1 \leq i, j < n` and `i \neq j`).

### Example:
- For `n = 4`, the initial list is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- Reversing the elements at even indices gives `[3, 2, 1, 4]`.
- This permutation is valid because:
  - `p_1 = 3` does not divide `p_3 = 1`.
  - `p_2 = 2` does not divide `p_4 = 4`.
  - No other pairs of indices satisfy the condition.

- For `n = 3`, the initial list is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- Reversing the elements at even indices gives `[3, 2, 1]`.
- This permutation is valid because:
  - `p_1 = 3` does not divide `p_3 = 1`.
  - No other pairs of indices satisfy the condition.

### General Case:
- For any `n`, the permutation generated by reversing the elements at even indices ensures that the condition is not met. This is because the elements at even indices are placed in a reversed order, which disrupts any potential divisibility pattern that could exist in the original list.

Thus, the program correctly generates a valid permutation for the given problem constraints.
