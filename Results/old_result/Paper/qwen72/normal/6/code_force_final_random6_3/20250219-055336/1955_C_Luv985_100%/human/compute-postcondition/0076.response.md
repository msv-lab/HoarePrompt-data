Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `n` is the first input value as an integer, `k` is the second input value as an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is the index after the last valid left index where `a[l]` was not zero, `r` is the index before the last valid right index where `a[r]` was not zero, `ans` is unchanged.**

The code snippet converts the list `a` from a list of strings representing integers to a list of actual integers. The values of `T`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `r`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
