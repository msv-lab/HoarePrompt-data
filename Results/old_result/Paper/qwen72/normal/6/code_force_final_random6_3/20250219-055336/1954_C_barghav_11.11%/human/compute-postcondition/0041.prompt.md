Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `a` and `b` are lists of characters where the first half of `a` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`, and the first half of `b` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`. The second half of `a` contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`, and the second half of `b` contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    print(a[i], end='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` and `b` are lists of characters that must have at least one element, `i` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` and `b` are lists of characters that must have at least two elements, `i` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` and `b` are lists of characters that must have at least two elements, `i` is 2, `len(a)` must be greater than 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
