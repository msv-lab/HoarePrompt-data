Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements from index 1 to index 3 of `a` if `a` has at least 4 elements, otherwise `temp` is a sorted list containing the first `i + 3` elements of `a`, `max` is equal to `temp[1]`.** 

The value of `max` is updated to the value of `temp[1]`, which is the second smallest element in the sorted list `temp`. All other variables remain unchanged.
