The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`. The loop will execute again if there are more elements in `arr` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first element of `arr`, and `arr` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least two elements, and `i` will be the second element of `arr`.

State: **`n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the second integer from `l1` and must be greater than or equal to the number of bits in `k`, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `arr` must have at least two elements, `ans` is a list containing a single element which is `1 << i`, `c` is 1. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing a single element which is `k0`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` contains the single element `1 << i` and `c` is 1.**
