The code snippet `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)` calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` under modulo `M`. The initial state specifies that `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user with `n` being greater than 0, and `M` is 1000000007. The value of `c` will be the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` under modulo `M`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` and `k` are integers provided by the user, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` under modulo 1000000007.**
