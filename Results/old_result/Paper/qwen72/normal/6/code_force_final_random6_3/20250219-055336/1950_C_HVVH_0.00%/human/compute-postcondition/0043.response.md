Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is 0, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the initial conditions and the input times provided. For each iteration, if `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` > 12, `h` is decreased by 12 and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'PM'.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 1440.
- The variable `s` remains a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
- The variable `n` is reduced to 0 after all iterations of the loop have completed.
- The variable `day` will be either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the initial conditions and the input times provided during each iteration.
- For each iteration of the loop:
  - If the hour `h` is 0, it is set to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'.
  - If the hour `h` is greater than 12, it is reduced by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'.
  - If the hour `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'AM'.
  - Otherwise, `day` remains 'PM'.
- The minutes `m` are not altered and remain the same as the input provided for each iteration.
