You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: `i` is `int(input()) - 1`, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `s` is the last user input string, `a` is the first integer from the last user input string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the last user input string `s`.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: - The `print` statement will output the string `'bob  '` exactly as it is written.
        #
        #Output:
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: `i` is `int(input()) - 1`, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `s` is the last user input string, `a` is the first integer from the last user input string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the last user input string `s`. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the program retains these values. If the sum of `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2, the program also retains these values.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b` between 1 and 10^9. The function returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
