Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `cnt` is explicitly set to 0 by the code snippet.
- Since `cnt` is now 0, and `ans` is the minimum of `n` and `cnt` if `a[1]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `ans` remains 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `i`) retain their initial values and conditions.
