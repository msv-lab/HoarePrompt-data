The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `vals`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `vals`. If `vals` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute one more time for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `vals` has at least 2 elements, `x` is the second integer in the list `vals`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `vals` must have at least 3 elements, and `x` will be the third integer in the list `vals`.

State: **`N` is an input integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 50), `vals` is a list of N integers where each integer `k_i` satisfies (2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20), `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)`, `x` is the third integer in the list `vals`, and `vals` must have at least 3 elements.**
