Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. `last` is a list that contains the value 2, and now has one more element, which is 2. If `a[2]` is equal to `a[1]`, `last` has one more element, which is the same as its previous last element.**

In natural language: The value of `i` is 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2. The list `last` now contains the value 2, and has one more element appended to it, which is also 2. If `a[2]` was equal to `a[1]`, `last` has one more element, which is the same as its previous last element.
