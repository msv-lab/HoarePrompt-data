The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `x`, but it does not use the integer `x` in its execution. The function returns the maximum integer value from the list `arr`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the maximum value from `arr` is returned, and `x` is not modified or used in any way.
