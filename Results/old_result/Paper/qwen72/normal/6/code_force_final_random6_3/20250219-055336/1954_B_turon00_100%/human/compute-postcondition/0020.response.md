Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 3 if `a[1]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 1, `ans` is equal to `n` if `a[1]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is the minimum of `n` and `0`.**
