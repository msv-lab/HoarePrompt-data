To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), with each integer from 1 to `n` appearing at most twice.
- The input to file descriptor `0` must contain at least 5 lines.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Reading the Line:**
   - The variable `line` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is implied that `line` is a line of input read from file descriptor `0`.
   - Since the input must contain at least 5 lines, `line` will be one of these lines.

2. **Splitting the Line:**
   - `line.split()` splits the line into a list of tokens (words or substrings) based on whitespace.
   - Let's denote the list of tokens as `tokens`.

3. **Counting Tokens:**
   - `len(tokens)` gives the number of tokens in the list.

4. **Creating a Set of Tokens:**
   - `{*tokens}` creates a set from the list of tokens, which removes any duplicate tokens.
   - `len({*tokens})` gives the number of unique tokens in the list.

5. **Calculating the Difference:**
   - The expression `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` calculates the difference between the total number of tokens and the number of unique tokens.
   - This difference represents the number of duplicate tokens in the line.

### Final Output:
The code snippet will print the number of duplicate tokens in the line read from file descriptor `0`.

Since the exact content of `line` is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output based on the structure of the problem.

Output: **number of duplicate tokens in the line (where the line is a line of input read from file descriptor 0)**
