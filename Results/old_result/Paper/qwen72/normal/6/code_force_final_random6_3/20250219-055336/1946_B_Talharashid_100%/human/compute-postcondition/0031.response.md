Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `c` is 0, and `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous value of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`. `n` and `k` are updated to the integers provided by the user, and both must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is reset to 0. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `maxi` remain as described in the initial state, with the exception that `n` and `k` are updated to the new integers provided by the user, which must both be greater than 1. The value of `maxi` is still the maximum value between the previous value of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.
