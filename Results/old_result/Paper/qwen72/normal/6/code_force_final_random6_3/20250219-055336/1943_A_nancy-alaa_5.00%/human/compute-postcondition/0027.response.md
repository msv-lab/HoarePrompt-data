Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and equal to `t`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
- `first` is `False`.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly given a value of 2.
- The other variables and objects (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`) are mentioned but are not used in the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
