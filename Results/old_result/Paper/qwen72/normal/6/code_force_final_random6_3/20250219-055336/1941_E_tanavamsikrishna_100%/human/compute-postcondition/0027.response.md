Output State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where `row[0]` is 1, `row[1]` to `row[d-1]` each have their values increased by 2, and `row[-1]` is 0; `d` is greater than 0 and less than the length of `row`; `i` is greater than or equal to `d + 5`; `min_heap` is a min-heap containing the elements from `row[:d]` and their respective indices, but the first three elements and their indices have been removed from the heap, and `e` has been added to the heap; `row[i-1]` is equal to `e[0] + row[i-1] + 1`; the tuple `(row[i-1], i-1)` has been added to `min_heap`; `e[1]` must be less than or equal to 3.**

The `pass` statement does not change any variables or state, so the initial state remains unchanged.
