Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for calculating the cost of building a bridge on a single row of the river.
   - It modifies the row by setting the first element to 1 (which is correct because the cost of installing a support in the first column is always 1, as the depth is 0).
   - It then increases each element from index 1 to `d-1` by 2. This is correct because the cost of installing a support in these cells is `a_{i,j} + 1`, and since the initial depth is `a_{i,j}`, the total cost is `a_{i,j} + 1 + 1 = a_{i,j} + 2`.
   - For each element from index `d` to the second-to-last element, it uses a min-heap to find the minimum cost of the previous `d` elements (including the first element which is now 1). This ensures that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - The function updates the current cell's cost by adding the minimum cost from the heap to the current cell's depth plus 1. This is correct because it ensures the minimum cost for installing a support in the current cell while maintaining the distance constraint.
   - Finally, it returns the last element of the row, which is the total cost of building the bridge on that row.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input for a single test case.
   - It reads the number of rows `n`, columns `m`, bridges `k`, and maximum distance `d`.
   - It then reads `n` rows of river depths and stores them in a list `rows`.
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1` and stores these costs in a list `costs`.
   - It computes the minimum sum of `k` consecutive row costs and prints this minimum sum.
   - The function ensures that the number of rows `n` is at least `k`, which is a valid constraint given in the problem.

3. **Overall Program**:
   - The program processes multiple test cases, reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case using `func_2`.
   - For each test case, `func_2` correctly calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.
   - The constraints and input format are respected, and the output is the minimum total cost for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
