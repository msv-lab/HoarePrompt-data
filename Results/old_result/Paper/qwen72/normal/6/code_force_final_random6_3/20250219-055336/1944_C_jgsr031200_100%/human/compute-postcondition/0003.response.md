The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has more elements, the loop will continue to the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first element of `arr`, and `freq[i]` was incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will now be the second element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `freq[i]` is incremented by 1.**
