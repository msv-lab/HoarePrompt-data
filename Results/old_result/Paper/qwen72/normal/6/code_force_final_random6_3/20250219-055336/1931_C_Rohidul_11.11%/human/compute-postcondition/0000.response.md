The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is a temporary variable used for iteration. The loop's execution depends on the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t`, `n`, and `a` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

However, the state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. This implies that `int(input())` should be `t` for the loop to execute the correct number of times.

State: **`_` is a temporary variable, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `int(input())` must be equal to `t`**
