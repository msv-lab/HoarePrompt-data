Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cp` is 0, `_` remains unchanged. `b` now contains the first element of `lit`. If `b` is not empty, `x` is set to infinity, and `y` is set to the last element of `b`. `x` is less than `y`. Additionally, `x` is less than or equal to `lit[i]`. The current value of `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.**
