Postcondition: ***`ldb` must have at least three elements, and `elem` is the third element of `ldb`. If `k - sz >= 2`, `sz` is increased by 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` after this increase, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged.***
