To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This is the loop iterator, and it starts at 0 by default in Python's `range` function.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute `n + 1` times. For the loop to execute at least once, `n + 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be at least 0.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5.
- `freq` is a list where each element at index `i` corresponds to the number of times the integer `i` appears in `arr`.
- `cou` is 0.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `n + 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be at least 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `freq` is a list where each element at index `i` corresponds to the number of times the integer `i` appears in `arr`, `cou` is 0, `n` must be at least 0, `i` is 0**
