Output State: **`input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `index` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`.**

The code snippet `k = int(data[index + 1])` assigns the integer value of the element at index 2 of the list `data` to the variable `k`. The initial state remains unchanged for all other variables, and `k` is now specifically the integer value of `data[2]`.
