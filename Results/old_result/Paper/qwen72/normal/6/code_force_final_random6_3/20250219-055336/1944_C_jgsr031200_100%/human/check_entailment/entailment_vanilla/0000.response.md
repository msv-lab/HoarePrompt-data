### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take turns picking elements from an array `a` and Alice appends the picked element to an array `c`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX, but since he cannot append to `c`, his strategy is to remove the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` from `a`.

3. **Frequency Analysis:**
   - The program calculates the frequency of each integer in the array `a` using a list `freq` of size `n + 1`.
   - The idea is to track how many times each integer appears in `a`.

4. **Determining the MEX:**
   - The program iterates through the integers from 0 to `n` and checks the frequency of each integer.
   - If an integer `i` appears at least twice, it can be ignored because both Alice and Bob can pick it, and it will not affect the MEX.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once, it is added to a counter `cou`.
   - If the counter `cou` reaches 2 or if an integer `i` does not appear at all, the program prints `i` and breaks the loop.

5. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly identifies the smallest integer that will be the MEX of `c` when both players play optimally.
   - The counter `cou` ensures that the program only considers the first two unique integers that appear exactly once, which is the correct approach to determine the MEX in this context.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where all integers appear at least twice, which results in the MEX being 0.
   - The program also handles the case where the array `a` is empty, which is not possible given the constraints but is implicitly handled by the logic.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` when both Alice and Bob play optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
