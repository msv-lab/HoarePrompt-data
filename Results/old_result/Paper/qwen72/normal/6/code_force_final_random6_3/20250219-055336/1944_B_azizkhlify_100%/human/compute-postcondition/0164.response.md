To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `res` is a list that may contain the first element of `a` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element `l[a[j] - 1]` is decremented by 2 for every `a[j]` that appeared twice in the first `n` elements of `a`.
   - `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element `r[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by the number of times `a[j]` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`.
   - `re` is 1 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `re` remains 0.
   - `ul` is the number of pairs of elements in `a` that appeared twice in the first `n` elements of `a` (up to a maximum of `k * 2`).
   - `ur` is 0.
   - `k` is `2 * k - ul`, and `k` is not zero.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - Therefore, `a[i]` will be `a[1]`, which is the second element of the list `a`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the second element of the list `a` followed by a space (since `end=' '` is specified).

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be the second element of the list `a`.

Output: **a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list a)**
