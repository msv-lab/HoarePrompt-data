Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to their previous element, otherwise `flag` is False, `ans` is Decimal('Infinity'), `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 0, and `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`.**
