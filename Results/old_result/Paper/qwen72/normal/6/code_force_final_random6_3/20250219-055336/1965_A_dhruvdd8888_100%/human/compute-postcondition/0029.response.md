The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `nums`. The loop iterates over `i` in reverse order from `len(nums) - 2` to `1` (inclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `len(nums) - 3`.
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has at least 3 elements.
- Each element in `nums` is now 0.
- `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums` before the loop.
- `nw` is the same as the previous value of `cw`.
- If `nums[i]` is 1, `cw` is False. Otherwise, `cw` remains True and `nums[i]` is not equal to 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be decreased by 1, so `i` will be `len(nums) - 4`.
- The loop condition `i > 0` must still hold, so `len(nums) - 4` must be greater than 0, which means `len(nums)` must be greater than 4.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has at least 4 elements, each element in `nums` is now 0, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums` before the loop, `i` is `len(nums) - 4`, `nw` is the same as the previous value of `cw`. If `nums[i]` is 1, `cw` is False. Otherwise, `cw` remains True and `nums[i]` is not equal to 1.**
