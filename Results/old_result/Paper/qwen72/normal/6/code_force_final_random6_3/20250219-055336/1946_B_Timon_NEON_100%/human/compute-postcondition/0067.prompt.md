Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `i` is len(arr) - 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list or a list containing the sum of the last segment of non-negative numbers and the starting index of this segment, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of non-negative numbers found during the loop and the starting index of this segment, `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a segment of non-negative numbers, the starting index of this segment, and the ending index of this segment, and `segments_variants` now includes an additional list: `new_segment` + [len(arr) - 1], `total_max_segment` is [-1].
Code of the loop:
for segment in segments_variants:
    if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1:
        total_max_segment = segment


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `i` is len(arr) - 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is a list containing the sum of the last segment of non-negative numbers and the starting index of this segment, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of non-negative numbers found during the loop and the starting index of this segment, `segments_variants` is a list of lists that must include at least one element: `new_segment` + [len(arr) - 1], and `total_max_segment` is either unchanged or updated to `segment` if `total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]` and `len(segment) != 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `i` is len(arr) - 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is a list containing the sum of the last segment of non-negative numbers and the starting index of this segment, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of non-negative numbers found during the loop and the starting index of this segment, `segments_variants` is a list of lists that must include at least two elements. If `total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]` and `len(segment) != 1`, `total_max_segment` is updated to the second element in `segments_variants`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `i` is len(arr) - 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is a list containing the sum of the last segment of non-negative numbers and the starting index of this segment, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment of non-negative numbers found during the loop and the starting index of this segment, `segments_variants` is a list of lists that must include at least three elements, `segment` is the third element in `segments_variants`. If `total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]` and `len(segment) != 1`, then `total_max_segment` is updated to be the third element in `segments_variants`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
