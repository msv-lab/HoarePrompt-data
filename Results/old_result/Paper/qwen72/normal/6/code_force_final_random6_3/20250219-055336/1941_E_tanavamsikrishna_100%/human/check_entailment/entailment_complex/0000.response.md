Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the minimum cost to install supports in a single row of the river.
   - It starts by setting the first element of the row to 1 and increasing the values of the first `d` elements by 2. This is to account for the cost of installing supports in these cells.
   - A min-heap is then used to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports up to the current cell. The heap is initialized with the first `d` elements of the row.
   - For each subsequent cell, the function ensures that the distance between the current cell and the last support is no more than `d` by removing elements from the heap that are too far away.
   - The cost for the current cell is then updated to the minimum cost from the heap plus the cost of installing a support in the current cell.
   - Finally, the function returns the last element of the row, which should be the minimum cost to install supports for the entire row.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input for a single test case, which includes the dimensions of the river grid (`n` and `m`), the number of bridges to build (`k`), and the maximum distance between supports (`d`).
   - It then reads the grid of river depths and calculates the cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1`.
   - The function then computes the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows and prints this value.

3. **Input and Output:**
   - The input constraints are respected, and the program correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - The output is the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows, which is what the problem requires.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `k` is 1 (i.e., only one bridge is built).
   - The program also handles the case where `m` is 3, which is the minimum number of columns, ensuring that the distance condition is met.

5. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the cost is minimized by using a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports up to the current cell.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly calculates the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows by summing the costs of `k` rows and finding the minimum sum.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
