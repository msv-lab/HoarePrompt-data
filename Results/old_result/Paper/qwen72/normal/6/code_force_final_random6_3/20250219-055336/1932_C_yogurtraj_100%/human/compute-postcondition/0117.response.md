Postcondition: **`ii` is 2, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 1 and updated to the values provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `t` is a user input string, `l` is the number of times the character 'L' appears in the string `t`, `i` is `n - 3`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where each element is 0 except the last element which is `k`. If `t[i]` is 'R', the element at index `i` in `y` is set to `k * a[q2] % m`, and `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`, and `q2` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the element at index `i` in `y` is set to `k * a[q1] % m`, and `q1` is decremented by 1.**
