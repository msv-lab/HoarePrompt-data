You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and each string s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        
        a = set()
        
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` is the initial user input, `i` has completed all iterations from 0 to `t-1`, and for each string `s` input during the loop, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s`. If `len(a) > 1`, the program has printed 'YES' and either a rotated version of `s` (second half concatenated with the first half), the reversed version of `s`, or a modified version of `s` (second half concatenated with the first half again) based on the conditions checked. If `len(a) <= 1`, the program has printed 'NO' for each such string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` from user input. If the string `s` contains more than one unique character, it prints 'YES' followed by a modified version of `s`: either a rotated version (second half concatenated with the first half), a reversed version, or a modified version (second half concatenated with the first half again), depending on the conditions checked. If the string `s` contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function ends.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string has a length of 1 correctly. According to the problem description, if the string has only one character, the output should be "NO" because it's impossible to rearrange a single-character string to form a new string that is not equal to the original. However, the program does not check for this condition and will incorrectly attempt to rearrange the string, leading to an incorrect output.

Example Input:
```
1
d
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Actual Output:
```
YES
d
```

This is incorrect because the program should output "NO" for a single-character string.
