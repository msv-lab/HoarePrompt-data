To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The state of `t`, `arr`, and `flag` are not directly relevant to the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted. The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because `range(1, n)` generates a sequence starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 1, and `i` starts at 1, which is the first value it will take in the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `flag` is True, and the function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters.**
