The given `print` statement simply prints the string 'YES'. The precondition provides information about the variables `t`, `_`, `n`, and `k`, but none of these variables or their values are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the precondition and will always be the same.

Output: **YES**
