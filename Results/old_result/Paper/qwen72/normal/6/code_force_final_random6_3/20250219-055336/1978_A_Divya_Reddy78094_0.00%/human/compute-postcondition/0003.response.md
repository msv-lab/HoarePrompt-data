The code snippet `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `nums`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user.**
