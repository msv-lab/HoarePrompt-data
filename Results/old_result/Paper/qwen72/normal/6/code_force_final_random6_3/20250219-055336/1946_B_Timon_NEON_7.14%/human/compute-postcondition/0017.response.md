Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is a list with the first element equal to `arr[0]`, `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and the first element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0.**

The code snippet `new_segment[0] += arr[i]` updates the first element of `new_segment` by adding the first element of `arr` to it. Since `new_segment` was initially an empty list, the first element is created and set to `arr[0]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
