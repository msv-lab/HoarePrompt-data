Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums` before the loop, each element in `nums` is now 0, `nw` is True, `cw` is True.**

The code snippet `cw = True` assigns the value `True` to the variable `cw`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
