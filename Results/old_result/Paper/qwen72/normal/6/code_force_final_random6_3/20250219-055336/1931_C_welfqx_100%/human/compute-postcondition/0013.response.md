Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1 if the first element of `num` is equal to the second element, otherwise `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `j` is 1. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, then `f` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `r`, `n`, `f`, `num`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
