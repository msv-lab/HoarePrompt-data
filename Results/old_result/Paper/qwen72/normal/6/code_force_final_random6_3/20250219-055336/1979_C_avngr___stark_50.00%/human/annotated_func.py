#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and k is a list of n integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `k` is a list of `n` integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20), `numbers` is a list with at least 2 elements, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list `numbers`, `num` is the last element of the list `numbers`.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (hcf) of all elements in the list `numbers`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `numbers` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the original input variables `t`, `n`, and `k` (if they exist) remaining unchanged, and the function having computed and returned the GCD of the `numbers` list.
