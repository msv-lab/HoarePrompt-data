To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
while lst[x]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `lst[x]` is non-empty. According to the given state:

- `x` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5.
- `_` is `x - 2`.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `lst[a]` is a list that includes `b` `x - 1` times.
- `lst[b]` is a list that includes `a` `x - 1` times.
- `s` is False.
- `lst[x]` is now non-empty.

Since `lst[x]` is already non-empty, the loop condition `lst[x]` will evaluate to `True`, and the loop will execute the first time. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `_` is `x - 2`, `a` and `b` are input integers, `lst[a]` is a list that now includes `b` `x - 1` times, `lst[b]` is a list that now includes `a` `x - 1` times, `s` is False, `lst[x]` is now non-empty**
