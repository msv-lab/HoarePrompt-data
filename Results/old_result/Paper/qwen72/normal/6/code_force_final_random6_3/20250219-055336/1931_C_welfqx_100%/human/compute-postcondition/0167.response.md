The value of `cn` is incremented by 1. The initial values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 3, these conditions still hold true. The output state is: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `cn` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `cn` is increased by 1**
