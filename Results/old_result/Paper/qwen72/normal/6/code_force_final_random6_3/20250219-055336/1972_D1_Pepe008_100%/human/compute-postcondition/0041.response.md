Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `x` is \((a - 1 \times (1 - 1)) // 1^2 + 1\), `suma` is \(a + 1 + x\).** 

Explanation:
- `x` is calculated as \((a - 1 \times (1 - 1)) // 1^2 + 1\), which simplifies to \((a - 0) // 1 + 1\), and further simplifies to \(a + 1\).
- `suma` was initially \(a + 1\) if \((a - 1 \times (1 - 1)) // 1^2 + 1 > 0\), which is always true since \(a + 1\) is always positive for positive `a`.
- The code snippet `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to `suma`.
- Therefore, `suma` is now \(a + 1 + x\), which is \(a + 1 + (a + 1)\) or \(2a + 2\).
- All other variables remain unchanged.
