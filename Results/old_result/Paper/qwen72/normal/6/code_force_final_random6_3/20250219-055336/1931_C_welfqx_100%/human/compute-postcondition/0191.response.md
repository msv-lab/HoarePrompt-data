The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`.

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, representing the elements of the list.

The function's output is not explicitly described, but given the context, it is likely that the function processes the list `a` in some way and returns a result based on the values in `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (an integer representing the length of the list), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). It processes the list `a` and returns a result based on the values in `a`.**
