Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `t` is a user input string, `l` is the number of times the character 'L' appears in the string `t`, `i` is 0, `y` is a list of `n` zeros where the first element is set to `k`, and the second element is set to `k * a[q2] % m` if `t[i]` is 'R', otherwise it is set to `k * a[q1] % m`. If `t[i]` is 'R', `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m` and `q2` is incremented by 1. If `t[i]` is not 'R', `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is decremented by 1.**
