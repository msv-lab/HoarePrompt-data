Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element (list) of the second tuple and must have at least `len(arr)` elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is now 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `num % y` from `arr` and its value is the count of occurrences of that key in `arr`.**
