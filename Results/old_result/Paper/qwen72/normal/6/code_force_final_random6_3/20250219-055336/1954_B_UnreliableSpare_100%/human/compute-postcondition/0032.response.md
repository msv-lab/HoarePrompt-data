Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to their previous element, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is increased by 1, `ans` is the minimum value between the initial `ans` and the updated `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between the initial `ans` and the new value of `cnt`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `t`, `arr`, `flag`, `val`) remain unchanged.
