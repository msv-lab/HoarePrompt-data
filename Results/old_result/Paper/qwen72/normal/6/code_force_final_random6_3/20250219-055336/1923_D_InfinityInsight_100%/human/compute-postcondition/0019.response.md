Output State: **`a` must be a non-empty list, `i` is the first element in `a`, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the corresponding element in `a` up to that index, `ans` remains a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, `left` is a list with an additional element appended, which is the sum of the last element in `left` and `i`.**

Explanation:
- The code `left.append(left[-1] + i)` appends a new element to the list `left`. This new element is the sum of the last element in `left` and the value of `i`.
- The initial state specifies that `i` is the first element in `a`, and `left` must have at least one element for the operation to be valid.
- The states of `a`, `last`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The new element in `left` is the result of adding the last element of `left` to `i`.
