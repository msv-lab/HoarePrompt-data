The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` attempts to remove the element at index `2` from the list `lst`. Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is a new input integer greater than 0
   - `t` is greater than `n * 2 + 1`
   - `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans` (now with an additional element)
   - `l` is a new input string
   - `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter, but the first element has been removed.

2. **Code Impact:**
   - The expression `1 * 2` evaluates to `2`.
   - `lst.remove(lst[2])` attempts to remove the element at index `2` from `lst`.

3. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `lst` has at least 3 elements, the element at index `2` will be removed.
   - If `lst` has fewer than 3 elements, an `IndexError` will occur, and the program will terminate.

4. **Output State Calculation:**
   - If `lst` has at least 3 elements, the element at index `2` is removed, and the length of `lst` is reduced by 1.
   - If `lst` has fewer than 3 elements, the program will terminate with an error, and no changes will be made to the variables.

Given the initial state, we assume `lst` has at least 3 elements to avoid an error. Therefore, the element at index `2` is removed from `lst`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `t` is greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans` (now with an additional element), `l` is a new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new `l` using spaces as the delimiter, but the first and third elements have been removed.**
