The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n`, a list of tuples `operations` where each tuple `(op_type, value)` specifies an operation on an array, and a list of positive integers `queries`. It constructs an array based on the operations: if `op_type` is 1, it appends `value` to the array; if `op_type` is 2, it duplicates the current array. After processing all operations, the function returns a list `result` containing the elements at indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`. The final state of the program includes the original `n`, the processed `operations` list, the constructed `array`, and the `result` list.
