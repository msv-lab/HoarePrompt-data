Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers where each integer `a_i` was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been increased by `i + 1` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`), and `a` is now sorted in descending order, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated and now unique list `a`, but the count of each element in `a` is decreased by 1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements of `a` in their original order, and additional elements that fill the gaps between consecutive elements of `a` such that the total number of elements in `ans` is `n + cnt`. The last element of `ans` is `ans[-1] - cnt`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 3 · 10^5 and must be greater than 0.
- The list `a` remains a list of unique integers, each originally in the range 1 to 10^9 and increased by `i + 1` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`), and it is sorted in descending order.
- The variable `i` remains `len(a) - 1`.
- The `counter` object remains a Counter that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated and now unique list `a`, but the count of each element in `a` is decreased by 1.
- The variable `cnt` is reduced to 0 after all iterations of the loop.
- The list `ans` initially contains all elements of `a` in their original order, and additional elements are appended to fill the gaps between consecutive elements of `a`. After all iterations, the total number of elements in `ans` is `n + cnt`, where `cnt` is the number of iterations that the loop executed.
- The last element of `ans` is `ans[-1] - cnt`, meaning that the last element is the original last element of `ans` minus the number of iterations `cnt`.
