The code snippet `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at the even indices of the list `a`. The elements at the odd indices remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

After the code execution:
- The elements at the even indices of `a` are reversed.
- The elements at the odd indices of `a` remain the same.

For example, if `n` is 5, the initial list `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. After the code execution, the list `a` becomes `[1, 4, 3, 2, 5]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), with elements at even indices reversed.**
