### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices `prices`.

2. **Heap Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) `pq` with tuples of the form `(price, day)`, where `price` is the ticket price on a given day and `day` is the index of that day.
   - This is a correct approach to efficiently access the day with the lowest current price.

3. **Heap Operations:**
   - The program uses a while loop to continue purchasing tickets until the total number of tickets bought `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.
   - In each iteration, it pops the day with the lowest current price from the heap.
   - It then calculates the number of tickets to buy on that day, which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets allowed per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - The cost of buying these tickets is added to `total_cost`.
   - The number of tickets bought is incremented by the number of tickets purchased.
   - The price increase for subsequent days is updated by adding the number of tickets purchased.

4. **Price Increase:**
   - The price increase is correctly applied to the popped price before calculating the cost of buying tickets on that day.
   - This ensures that the prices for subsequent days are adjusted as per the problem statement.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total cost for each test case, which is the result of the function `func_1`.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The use of a min-heap ensures that the program always buys tickets on the day with the lowest current price, which is a greedy approach.
- The price increase is correctly applied to the popped price, ensuring that the prices for subsequent days are adjusted.
- The program correctly handles the constraints and ensures that no more than `m` tickets are bought on any single day.

### Verification Using Annotations:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that \(1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5\), \(1 \le m \le 10^9\), and \(1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9)\).
  - `prices` is a list of `n` integers such that \(1 \le \text{prices}[i] \le 10^9\) for all \(0 \le i < n\).

- **State of the program within the while loop:**
  - `price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)` ensures that the day with the lowest current price is selected.
  - `price += price_increase` correctly adjusts the price for the current day.
  - `tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)` ensures that the number of tickets bought does not exceed the daily limit `m` or the remaining tickets needed.
  - `total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy` correctly calculates the cost of buying the tickets.
  - `tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy` correctly updates the total number of tickets bought.
  - `price_increase += tickets_to_buy` correctly updates the price increase for subsequent days.

- **State of the program right before the return statement:**
  - `total_cost` is the sum of the costs of buying `k` tickets.
  - `tickets_bought` is `k`.
  - `price_increase` is the total number of tickets bought.
  - `pq` is a heap with `n` elements reduced by the number of elements that have been popped.

- **Return Statement:**
  - The program returns the sum of the costs of buying `k` tickets, which is the correct output for the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It uses a min-heap to efficiently find the day with the lowest current price and applies the price increase correctly. The algorithm is consistent with the problem's constraints and requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
