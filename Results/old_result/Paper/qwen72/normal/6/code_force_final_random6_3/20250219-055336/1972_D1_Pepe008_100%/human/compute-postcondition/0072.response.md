Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings from the new input, `a` is the integer value of the first string in `info`, `b` is the integer value of the second string in `info` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `x` is \((a - 3 \times 2) // 3^2 + 1\), `suma` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to \((a - 3 \times 2) // 3^2 + 1\), which simplifies to \((a - 6) // 9 + 1\).
- The values of `n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The variable `suma` remains unchanged because the code snippet provided does not modify it.
