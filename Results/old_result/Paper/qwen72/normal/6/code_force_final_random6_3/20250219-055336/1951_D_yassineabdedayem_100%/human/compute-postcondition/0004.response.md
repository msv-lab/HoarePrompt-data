Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` and `k` are input integers.
- The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.

The print statement is:
```
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The values of the variables `t`, `_`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this print statement because the print statement is not dependent on any of these variables. It only prints a fixed string.

Output: **YES**
