Output State: **`x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `i` is `input() - 1`, `y` is `x - 1`**

### Explanation:
- **`x`**: The value of `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000. This value is taken from the user input and remains unchanged for each iteration of the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be one less than the number of times the loop ran. Since the loop runs `int(input())` times, `i` will be `int(input()) - 1` when the loop finishes.
- **`y`**: The value of `y` is `x - 1` for each iteration of the loop. However, since `x` is re-assigned in each iteration, the final value of `y` will be `x - 1` where `x` is the last input integer provided by the user.
