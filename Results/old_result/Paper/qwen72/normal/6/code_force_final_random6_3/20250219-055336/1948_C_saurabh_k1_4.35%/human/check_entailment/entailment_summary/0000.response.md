Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a robot starting at cell (1, 1) can reach cell (2, n) in a grid with arrows pointing left or right. The robot moves in two steps each second: first, it moves in one of the four directions (left, right, up, down), and then it follows the arrow in the cell it lands on.

The provided program checks if the character at the second-to-last position in the second row (`b[n - 2]`) is '<'. If it is, the program prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. This check is based on the idea that for the robot to reach the cell (2, n), it must be able to move to the right from the cell (2, n-1) to reach (2, n). If the arrow at (2, n-1) points to the left, the robot cannot move to (2, n).

However, this check alone is not sufficient to determine the correctness of the program. The robot can potentially reach (2, n) through various paths, and the program's check only considers one specific condition. The robot can move to (2, n) if there is a way to navigate the grid such that it eventually reaches (2, n-1) and the arrow there points to the right. The program's logic does not account for all possible paths the robot can take to reach (2, n-1).

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
1. The robot must be able to move from (1, 1) to (2, n-1) and then to (2, n).
2. The robot can move left, right, up, or down, but it cannot skip a move.
3. The robot must follow the arrow in the cell it lands on after each move.

The provided program only checks if the arrow at (2, n-1) points to the right, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition. The robot could be blocked from reaching (2, n-1) by other arrows in the grid. Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not fully account for the robot's movement and the grid's configuration.

Correctness: **False**
