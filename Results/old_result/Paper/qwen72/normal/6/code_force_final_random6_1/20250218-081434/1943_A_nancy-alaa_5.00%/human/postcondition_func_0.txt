The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function prints the smallest integer `i` (0 â‰¤ i < n) that is either missing from the list or occurs exactly once and is the first such integer encountered. If no such integer exists, the function does not print anything for that test case. The state of the program after the function concludes remains unchanged for each test case, with `n` and `arr` being the same as they were at the start of the test case.
