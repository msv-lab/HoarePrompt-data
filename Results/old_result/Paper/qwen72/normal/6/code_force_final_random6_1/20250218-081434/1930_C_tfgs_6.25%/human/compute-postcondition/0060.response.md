The only object in the loop head is the variable `cnt`. The loop will execute as long as `cnt` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a` but all values in `counter` are now 0, `cnt` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` and additional elements such that the total length of `ans` is `n`, and these additional elements are the largest possible integers that can be inserted between the elements of `a` without violating the uniqueness and descending order. The last element of `ans` is now `ans[-2] - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt - 1`**
