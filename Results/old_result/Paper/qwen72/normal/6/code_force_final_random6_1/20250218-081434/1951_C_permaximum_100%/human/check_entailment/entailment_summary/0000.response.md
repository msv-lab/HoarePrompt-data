Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days with the constraint that no more than `m` tickets can be bought on any single day, and the price of tickets increases by the number of tickets bought on previous days. The approach taken by the function `func_1` is to use a priority queue (min-heap) to always buy tickets from the day with the lowest current price. This is a good strategy because it ensures that the tickets are bought at the lowest possible cost at each step.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1. **Priority Queue Initialization**: The function initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with the initial prices and their respective days.
2. **Total Cost and Tickets Bought**: It initializes `total_cost` to 0 and `tickets_bought` to 0, and `price_increase` to 0 to keep track of the cumulative increase in prices due to previous purchases.
3. **Buying Tickets**: The function enters a loop where it continues to buy tickets until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`. In each iteration:
   - It pops the day with the lowest current price from the heap.
   - It calculates the new price by adding the cumulative `price_increase`.
   - It determines the number of tickets to buy on this day, which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum allowed per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - It updates the `total_cost` by adding the cost of the tickets bought on this day.
   - It updates `tickets_bought` by adding the number of tickets bought.
   - It increases `price_increase` by the number of tickets bought on this day.
4. **Return Total Cost**: After the loop, the function returns the `total_cost`.

The execution summary confirms that the function correctly buys `k` tickets and calculates the total cost, taking into account the price increase after each purchase. The use of a priority queue ensures that the tickets are always bought at the lowest available price, which is optimal for minimizing the total cost.

Based on the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to be correct and follows the required logic.

Correctness: **True**
