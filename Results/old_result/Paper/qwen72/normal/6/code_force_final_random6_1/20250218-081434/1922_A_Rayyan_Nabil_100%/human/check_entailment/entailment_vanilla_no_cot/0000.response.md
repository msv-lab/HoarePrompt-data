Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not fully implement the logic required to determine if a template exists such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are different from the corresponding character in `c`. However, it does not ensure that the characters in `a` and `b` match the template correctly according to the problem's rules.

Here is the correct logic that should be implemented:

1. For each position `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the template character `t[i]` must be:
   - Lowercase if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, and it must match `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
   - Uppercase if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, and it must be the uppercase version of a character that is not `c[i]`.

2. If such a template can be constructed, then `a` and `b` will match it, and `c` will not match it.

Let's correct the program:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    template = []
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            if a[i] == c[i]:
                return 'NO'
            template.append(a[i])
        else:
            if a[i] == c[i] and b[i] == c[i]:
                return 'NO'
            # Choose an uppercase letter that is not the lowercase version of c[i]
            if a[i] != c[i]:
                template.append(a[i].upper())
            else:
                template.append(b[i].upper())
    return 'YES'

def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

In this corrected version:
- `func_1` constructs the template based on the conditions given in the problem.
- It returns 'NO' if it is impossible to construct a valid template.
- It returns 'YES' if a valid template can be constructed.

This should correctly solve the problem as described.
