Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first integer in the list `a`, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is 0 or `n` depending on the initial conditions. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.***
