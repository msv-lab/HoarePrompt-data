Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where 0 <= `arr[i]` < len(`arr`) for all i, and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5) and `arr` must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `arr`, `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `freq[i]` is now 2 for the first element in `arr`.** 

Explanation: The code `freq[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` in the `freq` list by 1. Initially, `freq[i]` was 1 for the first element in `arr`, so after the increment, `freq[i]` is now 2. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
