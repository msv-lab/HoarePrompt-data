Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 2, `i` is 3, `x` is now `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
- Given `i` is 3, the expression simplifies to `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3 ** 2 + 1`, which further simplifies to `(a - 6) // 9 + 1`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.
