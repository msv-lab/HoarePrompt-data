### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` containing `n-1` elements.
   - This matches the problem description and ensures that the input is handled correctly.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - The first element `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This is a valid choice because `1 \le a_i \le 10^9` and `arr[0] + 1` will always be greater than `arr[0]`.

3. **Constructing the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the array `arr` from the first to the second-to-last element.
   - For each element `i` in `arr`, it sets `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
   - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, it enters a while loop to increment `ans[i + 1]` by `ans[i]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`.
   - This ensures that `ans[i + 1]` is always greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, which is necessary for the modulo operation to produce the correct result.

4. **Final Element:**
   - The last element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.
   - This ensures that `ans[-1] \bmod ans[-2] = arr[-1]`, which is required by the problem statement.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed array `ans` for each test case.
   - The output format matches the problem description, printing each element of `ans` separated by spaces.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The algorithm ensures that each `a_i` is constructed such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}`.
- The while loop in the construction of `ans[i + 1]` ensures that the condition `ans[i + 1] >= arr[i + 1]` is met, which is necessary for the modulo operation to produce the correct result.
- The final element `ans[-1]` is constructed correctly to satisfy the last modulo condition.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the edge case where `n = 2` correctly by setting `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[1]` to `arr[0] + ans[0]`.
- The program also handles the case where `arr[i + 1]` is greater than `ans[i + 1]` by incrementing `ans[i + 1]` until it is greater than `arr[i + 1]`.

### Verification with Function Summary:
- The function summary states that `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, which is correct.
- The summary also states that for each subsequent element (from index 1 to `n-2`), `ans[i]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[i]` that can be formed by adding `ans[0]` multiple times to the cumulative sum of previous elements in `ans` and `arr`. This matches the implementation in the while loop.
- The final element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`, which is correct according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement. The function summary and the original assessment are accurate.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
