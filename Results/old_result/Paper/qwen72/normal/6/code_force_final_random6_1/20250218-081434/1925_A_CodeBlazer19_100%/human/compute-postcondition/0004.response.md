The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `n` and `k` are input integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1, and `t` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers.**
