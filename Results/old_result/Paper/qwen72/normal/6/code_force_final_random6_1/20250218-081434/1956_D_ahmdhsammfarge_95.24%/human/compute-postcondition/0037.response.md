Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, `i` is 1, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop, `r` is [1, `l`] where `l` is the index j where the condition `sm > over_sum` was last satisfied, and `l` is the index j where the condition `sm > over_sum` was last satisfied.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The list `lst` remains unchanged, with a length between 1 and 18.
- The variable `i` is still 1, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `j` has reached the last index of the list, which is `len(lst) - 1`.
- The variable `sm` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` (which is just the first element since `i` is 1) plus the sum of the elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst` (which is 0 if `j` is the last index) plus the square of the number of elements between `i` and `j` (inclusive), which is `(j - i + 1) ** 2`.
- The variable `over_sum` holds the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop.
- The variable `r` is a list containing the indices `[1, l]`, where `l` is the index `j` where the condition `sm > over_sum` was last satisfied.
- The variable `l` is the index `j` where the condition `sm > over_sum` was last satisfied. If the condition was never satisfied, `r` remains 0 and `l` remains the initial value (which is 2 if the loop executed at least once).
