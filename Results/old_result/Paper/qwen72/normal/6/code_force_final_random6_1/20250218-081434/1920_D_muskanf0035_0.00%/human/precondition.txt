n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), operations is a list of n tuples (b, x) where b is an integer in {1, 2} and x is a positive integer (1 ≤ x ≤ n for b=1, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9 for b=2), and queries is a list of q positive integers (1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c)), where c is the size of the array after performing all operations.
