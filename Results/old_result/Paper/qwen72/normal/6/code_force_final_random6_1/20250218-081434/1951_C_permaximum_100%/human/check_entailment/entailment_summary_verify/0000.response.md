### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of prices `prices`.

2. **Priority Queue (Min-Heap)**:
   - The program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always select the day with the lowest current price for purchasing tickets.
   - The heap is initialized with tuples `(price, i)` where `price` is the initial price on day `i`.

3. **Price Increase**:
   - The program correctly handles the price increase for subsequent days after purchasing tickets.
   - The `price_increase` variable keeps track of the total number of tickets bought so far, and this value is added to the price of each ticket purchased on subsequent days.

4. **Ticket Purchase Logic**:
   - The program buys the minimum of `m` tickets or the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`) on each day.
   - This ensures that the program does not exceed the daily ticket purchase limit and buys exactly `k` tickets.

5. **Total Cost Calculation**:
   - The total cost is calculated by multiplying the current price (including the price increase) by the number of tickets bought on that day and adding it to the `total_cost`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `m`, the program will buy all tickets on the first available day with the lowest price.
   - If `k` is large and the daily limit `m` is small, the program will spread the purchases over multiple days, always choosing the day with the lowest current price.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initialization**:
  - The heap is initialized with the initial prices and their corresponding days.
  - This ensures that the program always starts with the lowest available price.

- **Heap Operations**:
  - The program uses `heapq.heappop` to get the day with the lowest current price.
  - The price is then adjusted by adding the `price_increase` to account for the tickets already bought.

- **Ticket Purchase**:
  - The program calculates the number of tickets to buy on the current day as `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`.
  - This ensures that the program does not exceed the daily limit `m` and buys exactly the number of tickets needed to reach `k`.

- **Price Increase**:
  - The `price_increase` is updated by adding the number of tickets bought on the current day.
  - This correctly reflects the increase in price for subsequent days.

- **Total Cost Calculation**:
  - The total cost is updated by adding the product of the current price (including the price increase) and the number of tickets bought on that day.
  - This ensures that the total cost is calculated correctly.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 3`, `prices = [8, 6, 4, 2]`
   - Initial heap: `[(2, 3), (4, 2), (6, 1), (8, 0)]`
   - Day 1: Buy 1 ticket at 2 (price = 2 + 0), heap: `[(4, 2), (6, 1), (8, 0), (3, 3)]`
   - Day 2: Buy 2 tickets at 4 (price = 4 + 1), heap: `[(6, 1), (8, 0), (5, 2), (4, 3)]`
   - Total cost: `2 + 4*2 = 10`

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 8`, `prices = [8, 6, 4, 2]`
   - Initial heap: `[(2, 3), (4, 2), (6, 1), (8, 0)]`
   - Day 1: Buy 2 tickets at 2 (price = 2 + 0), heap: `[(4, 2), (6, 1), (8, 0), (4, 3)]`
   - Day 2: Buy 2 tickets at 4 (price = 4 + 2), heap: `[(6, 1), (8, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3)]`
   - Day 3: Buy 2 tickets at 6 (price = 6 + 4), heap: `[(8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3)]`
   - Day 4: Buy 2 tickets at 8 (price = 8 + 6), heap: `[(10, 0), (10, 1), (10, 2), (10, 3)]`
   - Total cost: `2*2 + 4*2 + 6*2 + 8*2 = 64`

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `m = 100`, `k = 1`, `prices = [10000, 1, 100, 10, 1000]`
   - Initial heap: `[(1, 1), (10, 3), (100, 2), (1000, 4), (10000, 0)]`
   - Day 1: Buy 1 ticket at 1 (price = 1 + 0), heap: `[(10, 3), (100, 2), (1000, 4), (10000, 0), (2, 1)]`
   - Total cost: `1`

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `n = 6`, `m = 3`, `k = 9`, `prices = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
   - Initial heap: `[(5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)]`
   - Day 1: Buy 3 tickets at 5 (price = 5 + 0), heap: `[(5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (8, 0)]`
   - Day 2: Buy 3 tickets at 5 (price = 5 + 3), heap: `[(5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (8, 1), (8, 0)]`
   - Day 3: Buy 3 tickets at 5 (price = 5 + 6), heap: `[(5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0)]`
   - Total cost: `5*3 + 8*3 + 11*3 = 72`

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase exactly `k` tickets under the given constraints. It handles all potential cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, and it produces the correct output for the given examples.
