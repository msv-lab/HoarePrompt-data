The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables `n`, `d`, `v`, and `u` are not changed by this statement. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `v` is 0, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, and the current loop iteration is skipped.**
