Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `_` is 0.
   - `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`.
   - `i` is the last element in `arr`.
   - `arr` must have at least one element.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` with the initial values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to the point where `c` equals `n - 1` or the loop breaks, and the remaining elements are zeros.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*ans)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `ans` is a list of length `n`.
   - The first few elements of `ans` are initialized to `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` until the loop breaks or `c` equals `n - 1`.
   - The remaining elements of `ans` are zeros.
   - `1 << i` is a bitwise left shift operation, which means `1` is shifted `i` positions to the left. This results in \(2^i\).

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.
   - The first few elements will be \(2^i\) where `i` is the last element in `arr`.
   - The remaining elements will be zeros.

Given the initial state, the exact number of elements that are \(2^i\) and the number of zeros depends on the length of `arr` and the value of `n`. However, we can describe the output in a general form:

Output: **[2^i, 2^i, ..., 2^i, 0, 0, ..., 0] (where the number of 2^i elements is the minimum of the length of `arr` and `n`, and the remaining elements are zeros)**

This means that the list `ans` will contain a series of \(2^i\) values followed by zeros, where \(2^i\) is the value of the last element in `arr` shifted left by `i` positions. The number of \(2^i\) values will be the minimum of the length of `arr` and `n`, and the rest of the elements will be zeros.
