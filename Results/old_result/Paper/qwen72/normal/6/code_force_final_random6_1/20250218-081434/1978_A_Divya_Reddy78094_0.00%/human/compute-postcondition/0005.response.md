Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `_` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is an input integer (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(nums[0] + nums[1])
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `nums[0]` is the first element of the list `nums`, which is the largest integer in the list because the list is sorted in descending order.
   - `nums[1]` is the second element of the list `nums`, which is the second largest integer in the list because the list is sorted in descending order.
   - The `print` statement will add these two largest integers and print the result.

Since the exact values of `nums` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of the list.

Output: **nums[0] + nums[1] (where nums[0] is the largest integer in the list `nums` and nums[1] is the second largest integer in the list `nums`)**
