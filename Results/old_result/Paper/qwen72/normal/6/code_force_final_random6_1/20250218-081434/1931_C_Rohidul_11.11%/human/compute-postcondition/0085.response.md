To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop:

1. `r > l`
2. `a[r] == a[r - 1]`

### Initial State:
- `_` is a placeholder (irrelevant for the loop condition).
- `n` is the input integer and `n` must be greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element.
- `r` is `n - 1` and `r` must be greater than 0.
- `st` is the number of times the loop executed (irrelevant for the loop condition).
- `end` is 0 (irrelevant for the loop condition).
- `ans` is `r - l` (irrelevant for the loop condition).

### Analysis:
- The condition `r > l` must be true for the loop to start.
- The condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must also be true for the loop to start.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `r` is already defined as `n - 1`, and `n` must be greater than 2, so `r` must be greater than 1.
- `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element, and it must be less than `r` for the loop to start.
- `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]` for the loop to start.

Given that `r` is `n - 1` and `n` is greater than 2, `r` is already greater than 1. Therefore, `r > l` can be satisfied if `l` is less than `r`.

However, the condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is not guaranteed by the initial state. To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state of `a` such that the last element `a[r]` is equal to the second-to-last element `a[r - 1]`.

### Final State:
- `n` is the input integer and `n` must be greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.
- `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element, and `l` must be less than `r`.
- `r` is `n - 1` and `r` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is the input integer and `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element and `l` must be less than `r`, `r` is `n - 1` and `r` must be greater than 0**
