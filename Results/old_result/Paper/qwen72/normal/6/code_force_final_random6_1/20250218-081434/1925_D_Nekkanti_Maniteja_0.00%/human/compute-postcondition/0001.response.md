Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.** 

The initial state specifies that `i` is 0 and `int(input())` must be greater than 0. After executing the code snippet, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input, with `n` being an integer greater than 0. The values of `m` and `k` are also integers but their specific values are not constrained by the initial state. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
