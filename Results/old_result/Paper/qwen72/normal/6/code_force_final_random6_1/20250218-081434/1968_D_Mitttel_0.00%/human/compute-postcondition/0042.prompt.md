Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read by `sys.stdin`, `index` is 1, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    k = int(data[index + 1])
    PB = int(data[index + 2])
    PS = int(data[index + 3])
    index += 4
    p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    result = func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)
    results.append(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read by `sys.stdin`, `index` is 5 + `2 * n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of the string at `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of the string at `data[3]`, `PS` is the integer value of the string at `data[4]`, `p` is a list of integers from the strings at `data[5:5 + n]`, `a` is a list of integers from the strings at `data[5 + n:5 + 2 * n]`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read by `sys.stdin`, `index` is now 9 + `4 * n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the new `result`, `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]` and now also the integer value of the string at `data[5 + 2 * n]`, `k` is now the integer value of the string at `data[5 + 2 * n + 1]`, `PB` is the integer value of the string at `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of the string at `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers from the strings at `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is now a list of integers from the strings at `data[index:index + n]`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `t` is now `t - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read by `sys.stdin`, `index` is now 13 + `5 * n` + `n`, `t` must be greater than 1, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the new `result`, `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]` and now also the integer value of the string at `data[5 + 2 * n]` and `data[index - 4]`, `k` is now the integer value of the string at `data[index - 3]`, `PB` is now the integer value of the string at `data[index - 2]`, `PS` is now the integer value of the string at `data[index - 1]`, `p` is now a list of integers from the strings at `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is now a list of integers from the strings at `data[index:index + n]`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
