Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires sorting a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts on substrings.
   - A cyclic shift of a substring \( s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r \) costs \( r - l + 1 \).

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case is a binary string.
   - The output is the minimum total cost for each test case.

3. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - `s = list(map(int, input().split()))`: This line is incorrect because `input().split()` will split the input string by spaces, which is not what we want for a binary string. Instead, we should read the input as a single string and convert it to a list of integers.
   - `n = 0`: This initializes a counter for the number of 1s encountered.
   - `ans = 0`: This initializes the total cost.
   - The loop `for i in range(len(s))` iterates over each character in the string.
   - `if s[i] == 1: n += 1`: This increments the counter `n` for each 1 encountered.
   - `if s[i] == 0 and n != 0: ans += n + 1`: This adds the cost of a cyclic shift to `ans` whenever a 0 is encountered and there are 1s before it. The cost is `n + 1` because it includes the 0 and all the 1s before it.
   - `print(ans)`: This prints the total cost for the current test case.

4. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - `t = int(input())`: This reads the number of test cases.
   - `for _ in range(t): func_1()`: This calls `func_1` for each test case.

5. **Issues**:
   - The main issue is in `func_1` where the input is incorrectly processed. The input should be read as a single string and then converted to a list of integers.
   - The correct way to read the input string and convert it to a list of integers is `s = list(map(int, list(input().strip())))`.

6. **Corrected Function 1**:
   - Replace `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` with `s = list(map(int, list(input().strip())))`.

7. **Correctness**:
   - After correcting the input processing, the logic in `func_1` is correct for calculating the minimum total cost to sort the binary string.
   - The logic correctly counts the number of 1s and adds the cost of cyclic shifts when a 0 is encountered after some 1s.

8. **Validation with Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at key points.
   - The state after the loop in `func_1` is accurate: `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s), `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `n` is the number of 1s in the list `s`, and `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each 0 in `s` that follows at least one 1.
   - The state in `func_2` is also accurate: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, and `func_1` is called `t` times.

9. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment correctly identified the main issue with the input processing in `func_1`.
   - The corrected version of `func_1` should work correctly for the given problem.

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the improper handling of the input string in `func_1`. The input should be read as a single string and then converted to a list of integers. Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, list(input().strip())))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for the given problem.
