The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than or equal to 0, and since the loop has executed once, `t` must now be decremented by 1 for the next iteration to potentially occur. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used for iterating, so it doesn't retain any specific state between iterations. The list `numbers` and the variable `n` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration. Since `t` was greater than or equal to 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be `t - 1`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing the initial input integer `n` and the new input integer `n`, `n` is updated to a new input integer.**
