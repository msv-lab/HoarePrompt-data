You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program does not correctly handle the requirement that the subsets `l` and `r` must each be of length `2k`. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that the subsets `l` and `r` are of the correct length and that the XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of elements in `r`.

**Example Case:**

Consider the input:
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

The expected output should be two subsets `l` and `r` each of length 2, such that the XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of elements in `r`. For example:
```
1 2
1 2
```

However, the program's output for this case is:
```
1 2
1 2
```

This output is correct for this specific case, but let's consider another input:
```
1
4 2
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

The expected output should be two subsets `l` and `r` each of length 4, such that the XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of elements in `r`. For example:
```
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
```

However, the program's output for this case is:
```
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
```

This output is correct, but the program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than 1 correctly. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the subsets `l` and `r` are of the correct length and that the XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of elements in `r` for all possible values of `k`.

**Issue:**

The program's logic for constructing the subsets `l` and `r` is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where `k` is greater than 1, and it does not ensure that the subsets are of the correct length and that their XORs are equal. The program also does not correctly handle the case where the subsets need to be constructed from different parts of the array.
