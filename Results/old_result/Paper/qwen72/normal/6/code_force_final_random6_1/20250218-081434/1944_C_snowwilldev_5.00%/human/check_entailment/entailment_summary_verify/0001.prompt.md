You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` handles multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of size `n`. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each element in `a` and prints the first index `i` where the count of `i` is 1 or where the count of `i` is 0. If no such index is found, it prints the last index `N-1`. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a`.

2. **Counting Elements**:
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - This is a valid and efficient way to keep track of the number of times each integer appears in the array.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The game's score is determined by the MEX of the array `c` after all elements have been removed from `a`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the score, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The key to solving this problem is to understand that the MEX of `c` will be the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in `c` after the game ends.

4. **Determining the MEX**:
   - The program iterates through the range of integers from 0 to `N-1` and checks the count of each integer.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once in `a`, it is added to the count `t`.
   - The program then checks if `t` (the number of integers that appear exactly once) is greater than or equal to 2, or if the integer `i` does not appear at all (`cnt[i] == 0`).
   - If either condition is met, the program prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice and Bob play optimally, which means Alice will always try to pick the smallest integer that appears exactly once to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to pick the smallest integer that appears exactly once to minimize the MEX.
   - The program's logic correctly captures this optimal play by ensuring that the MEX is determined by the smallest integer that either does not appear at all or appears exactly once and has been picked by both players.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the array `a` might contain all unique elements or all elements might be the same.
   - For example, if all elements are the same, the MEX will be 0, which is correctly handled by the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. The conditions and logic used are appropriate for the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
