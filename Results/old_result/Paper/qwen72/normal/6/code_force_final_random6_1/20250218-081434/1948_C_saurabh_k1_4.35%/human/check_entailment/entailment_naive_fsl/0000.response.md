Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
4
>><<
>>><
```

The expected output is "YES" because the robot can follow the path: (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (1, 3) → (2, 3) → (2, 4). However, the program will output "No" because it only checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row (b[n - 2]) is pointing left. In this case, b[2] is "<", so it incorrectly prints "No".

The logic in the program is too simplistic and does not account for the complex interactions between the arrows in both rows, which can lead to the robot reaching the target cell (2, n) in multiple ways.
