Postcondition: **`x` is an input integer and `x` is now `x - 1` (which is at least 1 and must be at least \(2^{i} - 2\)), `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i} \leq x + 1\). If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is now `x - 2` and `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i`.**
