Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `tc` is 1 or 2.
- `N` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `i` is 1.
- `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with default type `int` where `cnt[a[i]]` is the count of how many times each integer in `a` appeared in the list `a` from index 0 to `N-1`.
- If `cnt[a[i]]` is 1, `t` is incremented by 1.
- If `t` is now greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[a[i]]` is 0, then `t` is set to 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
- Otherwise, `t` remains incremented by 1 and `cnt[a[i]]` is 1.
- If `cnt[a[i]]` is not 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken and `t` is set to 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is explicitly set to 1.
2. **Variable `cnt`**: `cnt` is a `defaultdict` that counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a` from index 0 to `N-1`.
3. **Variable `t`**: The value of `t` is not explicitly given, but it is incremented based on the conditions described. However, the exact value of `t` is not needed to determine what `print(i)` will output.

### Explanation:
- The `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of `i`.
- Since `i` is explicitly set to 1, the output will be 1.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
