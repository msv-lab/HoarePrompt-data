Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The length of `test_cases` is `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `N` is an input integer. `nums` is a sorted list of integers, and now includes the integer 0. `ls` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(nums)):
    nums[i] -= ls
    ls += nums[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and must have at least 1 element, `ls` is equal to the first element of `nums`, `i` is 0, and the first element of `nums` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and must have at least 2 elements, `ls` is equal to the first element of `nums` plus `nums[1] - ls`, `i` is 1, `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - ls`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and must have at least 3 elements, `ls` is now equal to the first element of `nums` plus `nums[1] - ls` plus `nums[2] - ls` plus `nums[2]`, `i` is 2, `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - ls`, `nums[2]` is now `nums[2] - ls`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
