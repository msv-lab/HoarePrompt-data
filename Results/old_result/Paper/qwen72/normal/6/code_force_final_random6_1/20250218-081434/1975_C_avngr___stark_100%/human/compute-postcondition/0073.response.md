Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]` in ascending order, `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`.** 

The value of `max` is now the second element of the sorted list `temp`, which contains the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]` in ascending order. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
