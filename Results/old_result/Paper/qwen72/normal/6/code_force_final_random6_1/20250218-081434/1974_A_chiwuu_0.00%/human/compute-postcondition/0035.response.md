Output State: **`t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is equal to `a - t1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1`.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- The values of `t1` and `t2` are still valid and remain as `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` and `t2 = a - t1`.
