The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print(2)
```

Let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\) and \(x \neq y\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` and `m` are new input integers greater than 0.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print` statement that prints the integer `2`.
   - The `print` statement does not reference any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - Since the `print` statement is simply printing the integer `2`, the output will be exactly `2`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **2**
