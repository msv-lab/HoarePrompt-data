Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program is designed to handle multiple test cases. `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case. This is correct based on the problem description.

2. **Binary String Reading**: `func_1` reads a binary string from the user input. However, the way it reads the input is incorrect. The input is expected to be a single binary string, but `func_1` uses `input().split()`, which is intended for splitting a string into multiple parts based on whitespace. This will not work correctly for a single binary string without spaces. The correct way to read a binary string would be `input().strip()`.

3. **Cost Calculation**: The logic inside `func_1` is intended to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string. The program iterates through the string and counts the number of 1s (`n`). For each 0 that follows at least one 1, it adds `n + 1` to the total cost (`ans`). This logic is based on the idea that each 0 that follows a 1 can be moved to the beginning of the string by a cyclic shift of length `n + 1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the cost should be 0, which the current logic handles correctly.
   - If the string has no 0s (e.g., "1111"), the cost should also be 0, which the current logic handles correctly.
   - If the string has no 1s (e.g., "0000"), the cost should be 0, which the current logic handles correctly.
   - For a string like "101011", the logic correctly calculates the cost as 5, which is the sum of `n + 1` for each 0 that follows at least one 1.

5. **Overall Logic**: The overall logic is correct for calculating the minimum cost to sort the binary string. However, the input handling in `func_1` is incorrect, which will lead to incorrect results or errors when the input is a single binary string without spaces.

Given the incorrect input handling, the program will not work as intended for the given problem description.

Correctness: **False**
