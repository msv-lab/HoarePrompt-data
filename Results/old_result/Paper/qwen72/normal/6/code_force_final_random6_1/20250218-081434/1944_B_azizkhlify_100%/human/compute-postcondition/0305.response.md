To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `res` is a list containing elements that satisfy `l[a[j] - 1] == 1` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
   - If `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `ur` is increased by 2 and the current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `i` is `n + 1`, which means `i` is one index past the last index of the list `a` (since `a` has `n` elements).
   - `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Since `i` is `n + 1`, this index is out of bounds for the list `a`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.
   - Since `i` is out of bounds for the list `a`, attempting to access `a[i]` will raise an `IndexError`.

Given this analysis, the `print` statement will not execute successfully because it will raise an `IndexError` due to accessing an index that is out of bounds.

Output: **IndexError (list index out of range)**
