You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), representing the number of piles and the initial number of stones in each pile, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    nums = set(input().split())
    nums = sorted(map(int, nums))
    if (len(nums) == 1) :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program prints 'Alice' and returns None.
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers representing the input values, and the length of `nums` is greater than 1.
    if (len(nums) == 2) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program prints 'Bob' and returns None.
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers representing the input values, and the length of `nums` is greater than 2.
    nums.insert(0, 0)
    cd = 0
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        if nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1:
            cd += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with a 0 inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is greater than 3. `i` is the largest integer such that the difference between `nums[i + 1]` and `nums[i]` is 1 for all 0 <= i < len(nums) - 2, or `i` is the index where the difference is not 1. `cd` is the number of consecutive pairs of elements in `nums` starting from the first element (0) where the difference is 1, or `cd` remains the value it had when the loop broke.
    if (cd & 1) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program prints 'Bob' and returns None.
    else :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program prints 'Alice' and returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function evaluates a set of predefined test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, and prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the outcome of each test case. The function always returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program prints 'Alice' and returns None.

Case_2: The program prints 'Bob' and returns None.

Case_3: The program prints 'Bob' and returns None.

Case_4: The program prints 'Alice' and returns None.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
