Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 0, `i` is 1, `values[1]` is 1, `sum_values[0]` is 0**

The code `values[i] = i` sets the value of `values[1]` to 1, as `i` is 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
