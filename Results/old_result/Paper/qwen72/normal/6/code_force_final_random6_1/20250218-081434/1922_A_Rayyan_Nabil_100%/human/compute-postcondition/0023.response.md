The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`. The loop iterates over the elements of the `results` list, and `result` is the current element being processed in the iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing `t` results, and `result` is the first element of `results`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `result` variable must be updated to the next element in the `results` list. Since the loop is iterating over the list, after the first iteration, `result` will be the second element in the `results` list.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing `t` results, each result being the output of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration, `result` is the second element of `results`**
