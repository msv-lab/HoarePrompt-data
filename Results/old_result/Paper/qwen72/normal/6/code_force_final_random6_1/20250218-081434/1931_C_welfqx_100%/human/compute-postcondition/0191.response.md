The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n, representing the elements of the list.

The function returns different outputs based on the values of these parameters. However, the specific output conditions are not provided in the prompt. Assuming the function is designed to process these parameters and return some result based on the constraints:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers. The function returns a result based on the processing of these parameters, but the specific return conditions are not detailed in the provided information.**
