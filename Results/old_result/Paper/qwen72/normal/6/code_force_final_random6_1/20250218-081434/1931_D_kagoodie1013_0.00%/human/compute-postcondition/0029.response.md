Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `results` is an empty list, `count` is the sum of the values of `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for all elements in `arr`, `mod_x_map` contains keys for each unique value of `num % x` in `arr` with the count of how many times each value appears, `mod_y_map` contains keys for each unique value of `num % y` in `arr` with the count of how many times each value appears, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The `test_cases` list remains unchanged.
- The tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is still the first tuple in `test_cases`.
- The `arr` list must have at least `n` elements, and the loop has processed all `n` elements.
- The `results` list remains empty.
- The `count` variable now holds the total number of times the values in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` were incremented during the loop.
- The `mod_x_map` dictionary contains keys for each unique value of `num % x` found in `arr`, with the value for each key being the count of how many times that specific remainder appeared.
- The `mod_y_map` dictionary contains keys for each unique value of `num % y` found in `arr`, with the value for each key being the count of how many times that specific remainder appeared.
- The `mod_x` and `mod_y` variables are set to the results of `-num % x` and `num % y` for the last element of `arr`, respectively.
- The `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` variables are set to the results of `num % x` and `num % y` for the last element of `arr`, respectively.
