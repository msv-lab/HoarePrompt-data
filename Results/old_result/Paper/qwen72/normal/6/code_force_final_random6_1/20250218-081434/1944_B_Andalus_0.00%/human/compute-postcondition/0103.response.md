The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sng` list. If `sng` is not empty (i.e., it has at least one element), the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, and `sz` is `min(k, 2 * len(rdb))`. These states do not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to execute, `sng` must have at least one element, and `elem` should be the first element in `sng`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `sz` is `min(k, 2 * len(rdb))`, `sng` is a list that must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `sng`**
