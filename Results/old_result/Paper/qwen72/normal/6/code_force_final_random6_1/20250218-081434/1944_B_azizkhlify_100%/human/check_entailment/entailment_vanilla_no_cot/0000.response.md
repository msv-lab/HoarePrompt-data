Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are the key problems:

1. **Incorrect Array Initialization and Usage**:
   - The arrays `l` and `r` are initialized with length `n`, but they should be initialized with length `2k` to store the subsets.
   - The program uses `l` and `r` to count occurrences of elements in the first and second halves of the array `a`, but it does not correctly handle the selection of elements to form the subsets.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Selecting Subsets**:
   - The program attempts to select elements from the first half of the array `a` to form the subset `l`, but it does not correctly ensure that the selected elements form a valid subset of the first half.
   - Similarly, the program attempts to select elements from the second half of the array `a` to form the subset `r`, but it does not correctly ensure that the selected elements form a valid subset of the second half.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of elements to be selected (`k * 2`) is not fully covered by the initial loop.

3. **Incorrect XOR Calculation**:
   - The program does not explicitly calculate the XOR of the elements in the subsets `l` and `r` to ensure that they are equal.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program does not correctly format the output to match the required format. It prints elements directly without ensuring that the subsets are of length `2k`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize the subsets l and r
        l = []
        r = []
        
        # Create a dictionary to store the indices of each element
        indices = {i: [] for i in range(1, n + 1)}
        for i in range(2 * n):
            indices[a[i]].append(i)
        
        # Select elements for l and r
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if len(indices[i]) == 2:
                if indices[i][0] < n and indices[i][1] < n:
                    l.extend([i, i])
                elif indices[i][0] >= n and indices[i][1] >= n:
                    r.extend([i, i])
                else:
                    l.append(i)
                    r.append(i)
        
        # Ensure the subsets are of length 2k
        while len(l) < 2 * k:
            for i in range(1, n + 1):
                if len(indices[i]) == 1 and indices[i][0] < n:
                    l.append(i)
                    r.append(a[indices[i][0] + n])
                    break
        
        # Print the subsets
        print(' '.join(map(str, l[:2 * k])))
        print(' '.join(map(str, r[:2 * k])))

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version:
- Initializes the subsets `l` and `r` as empty lists.
- Uses a dictionary to store the indices of each element in the array `a`.
- Selects elements for `l` and `r` based on the indices, ensuring that the subsets are valid and of length `2k`.
- Ensures the subsets are of the correct length by adding elements as needed.
- Prints the subsets in the required format.
