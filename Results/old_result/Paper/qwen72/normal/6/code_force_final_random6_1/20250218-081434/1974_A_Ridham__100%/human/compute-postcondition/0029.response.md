Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 1, `result` is a list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`, and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `screen_require_for_y` is updated to `y // 2`, which is the integer division of `y` by 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `result`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, and `remaining_cells`) remain unchanged but are still part of the output state.
