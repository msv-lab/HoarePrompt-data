Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(T):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a == b:
        print('Bob')
    elif a == 1:
        print('Alice')
    elif b == 1:
        print('Bob')
    elif a % 2 == 1:
        print('Bob')
    elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
        print('Alice')
    elif a > b:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` is equal to `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` remains unchanged. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the following conditions apply: If `a` is 1, `a` remains 1. If `a` is not 1, `a` retains its value and parity (odd or even). If `b` is 1, `b` remains 1. If `b` is not 1, `b` retains its value and parity (odd or even), and the relationship between `a` and `b` (whether `a` is greater than, less than, or equal to `b`) remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are the input integers. If `a` is equal to `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` remains unchanged. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the following conditions apply: If `a` is 1, `a` remains 1. If `a` is not 1, `a` retains its value and parity (odd or even). If `b` is 1, `b` remains 1. If `b` is not 1, `b` retains its value and parity (odd or even). The relationship between `a` and `b` (whether `a` is greater than, less than, or equal to `b`) remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `a` and `b` are the new input integers. If `a` is equal to `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` remains unchanged. If `a` is not equal to `b`, the following conditions apply: If `a` is 1, `a` remains 1. If `a` is not 1, `a` retains its value and parity (odd or even). If `b` is 1, `b` remains 1. If `b` is not 1, `b` retains its value and parity (odd or even). The relationship between `a` and `b` (whether `a` is greater than, less than, or equal to `b`) remains unchanged. Additionally, if `b` is not 1 and `a` is even and `b` is odd, the relationship between `a` and `b` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
