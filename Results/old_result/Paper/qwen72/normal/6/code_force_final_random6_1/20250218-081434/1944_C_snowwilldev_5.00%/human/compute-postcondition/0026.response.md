The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `N`. The loop can execute one more time if `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `N` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `N`.

State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `i` is 2.**
