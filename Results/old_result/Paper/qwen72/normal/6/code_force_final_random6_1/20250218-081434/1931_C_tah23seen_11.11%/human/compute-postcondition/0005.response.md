Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 1; `j` is len(arr) - 2; the first element of `arr` (arr[0]) is equal to the last element of `arr` (arr[j + 1]).** 

The value of `j` is decremented by 1, so `j` is now `len(arr) - 2`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
