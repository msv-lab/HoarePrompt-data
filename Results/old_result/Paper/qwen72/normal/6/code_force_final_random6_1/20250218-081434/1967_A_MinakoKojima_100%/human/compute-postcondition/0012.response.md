Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a`, `i` is 0, `dif` is the difference between the second and the first element of `a`, and `dif` is not 0. `res` remains equal to `n - 1`.**
