Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `x`, followed by the permutation `array`.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The original assessment correctly identified a logical error in the binary search condition. The condition `if array[mid] >= find` should indeed be `if array[mid] <= find` to correctly move the `l` pointer when `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`. This is crucial for the binary search to function correctly in the context of the problem.

3. **Swapping Logic**: The original program's logic for swapping is mostly correct. It checks if the element at position `l` is equal to `x` after the binary search. If not, it prints `1` and returns the indices to swap the element at position `l` with the element at the position of `x` in the array. This ensures that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search. However, the original program incorrectly prints the number of operations inside the function, which should be handled outside the function.

4. **Output Handling**: The original program prints the number of operations inside the function, which is incorrect. The number of operations should be printed outside the function before printing the indices. Additionally, the program should handle the case where no swaps are needed by printing `0` and not returning any indices. The corrected program addresses this by moving the print statements outside the function.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases where the permutation is already sorted or where the element `x` is at the beginning or end of the array. The current logic seems to handle these cases correctly, but the binary search condition needs to be fixed to ensure correctness.

6. **Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a while loop to process each test case.

Given the above points, the original program has the following issues:
- Incorrect binary search condition.
- Incorrect output format for the number of operations and the indices of the swaps.

The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly for the given problem.

Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect due to the logical error in the binary search condition and the incorrect handling of the output format. The corrected program, as provided in the original assessment, is the correct version.
