The provided code snippet is:
```
print('Bob')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state describes the conditions and relationships between the variables `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b`.
- However, the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'Bob'`.

### Conclusion:
Since the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and only prints a fixed string, the output will always be the same regardless of the values of `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b`.

Output: **Bob**
