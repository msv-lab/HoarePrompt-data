Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function initializes the scores for Bodya and Sasha by calling the `calculate_score` function with their respective starting positions.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate result: "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if the scores are equal.

2. **Function 2 (`calculate_score`)**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position.
   - It keeps track of the current position and the score, and uses a dictionary `visited` to detect cycles in the permutation.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by first determining the score for one full cycle and then multiplying it by the number of full cycles that can fit in the remaining steps. It also adds the score for the remaining steps after the full cycles.
   - If no cycle is detected, it simply continues to add the score until the number of steps reaches `k`.

3. **Function 3 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the input from `stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input data and calls `func_1` for each test case, appending the results to a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The program handles the constraints and input format correctly, and the logic for detecting cycles and calculating scores is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
