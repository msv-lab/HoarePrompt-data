### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game with an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move to achieve their goal.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many small integers as possible in `c`.
   - To minimize the MEX, Bob should try to remove the smallest integers that are not yet in `c`.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - If an integer `i` appears more than once in `a`, Alice can always pick it to include in `c` without Bob being able to prevent it.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once in `a`, Alice can pick it only if it is her turn and Bob hasn't picked it yet.
   - If an integer `i` does not appear in `a`, it will be the MEX of `c` at the end of the game.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `a`.
   - It iterates through the range from `0` to `n-1` to find the smallest integer `i` that is not in `a` or appears only once in `a`.
   - If `i` is not in `a`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - If `i` appears exactly once in `a` and it is Alice's turn (indicated by `first` being `True`), it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - If `i` appears exactly once in `a` and it is Bob's turn (indicated by `first` being `False`), it sets `first` to `True` and continues.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest integer `i` that is not in `a` or appears only once.
   - The logic for determining whether it is Alice's or Bob's turn is correct, as `first` is used to track Alice's first turn.
   - The program prints the correct MEX value for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob.

**Correctness: True**
