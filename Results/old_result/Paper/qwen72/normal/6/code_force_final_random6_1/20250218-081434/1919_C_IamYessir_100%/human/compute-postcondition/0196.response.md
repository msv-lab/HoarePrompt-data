Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list with `lit[1]` appended to it, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity; otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of list `a`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity; otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index 1 of the list `lit` to the list `b`.
- The value of `i` is 1, so `lit[1]` is appended to `b`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `s`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `y` will now be the last element of `b`, which is `lit[1]`, unless `b` was initially empty, in which case `y` remains infinity.
- The count `s` of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element might change depending on the value of `lit[1]` and the previous elements in `b`, but this is not explicitly calculated in the given code snippet.
