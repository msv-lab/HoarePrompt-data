Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `k` is an input integer, `ldb` is a list containing the second element of `lft` and `lft[i]`, `sng` remains an empty list if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i] != lft[i + 1]` is not satisfied, otherwise `sng` contains the value of `lft[2]`. `sz` is the minimum of the new `k` and the number of elements in `rdb` times 2 plus the number of elements printed from `sng`. `_` is `T + 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was processed before the loop broke or finished, `lst` is a list of integers read from input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation:
- The code `ldb.append(lft[i])` adds the element at index `i` of `lft` to the list `ldb`.
- Since `i` is 3, `ldb` now contains the second element of `lft` (as per the initial state) and `lft[3]`.
- The other variables (`n`, `k`, `sng`, `sz`, `_`, `rdb`, `elem`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`) remain unchanged.
