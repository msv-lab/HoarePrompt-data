Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts on substrings.
   - A cyclic shift of a substring \( s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r \) costs \( r - l + 1 \).

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case is a binary string.
   - The output is the minimum total cost for each test case.

3. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - `s = list(map(int, input().split()))`: This line attempts to split the input string and convert each part to an integer. However, the input is a single binary string without spaces, so `input().split()` will return a list with a single element, and `map(int, ...)` will convert that single element to an integer, which is incorrect.
   - `n = 0`: This initializes a counter for the number of 1s encountered.
   - `ans = 0`: This initializes the total cost.
   - The loop `for i in range(len(s))` iterates over each character in the string.
   - `if s[i] == 1: n += 1`: This increments the counter `n` for each 1 encountered.
   - `if s[i] == 0 and n != 0: ans += n + 1`: This adds the cost of a cyclic shift to `ans` whenever a 0 is encountered and there are 1s before it. The cost is `n + 1` because it includes the 0 and all the 1s before it.
   - `print(ans)`: This prints the total cost for the current test case.

4. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - `t = int(input())`: This reads the number of test cases.
   - `for _ in range(t): func_1()`: This calls `func_1` for each test case.

5. **Issues**:
   - The main issue is in `func_1` where the input is incorrectly processed. The input should be read as a single string and then converted to a list of integers.
   - The correct way to read the input string and convert it to a list of integers is `s = list(map(int, list(input().strip())))`.

6. **Corrected Function 1**:
   - Replace `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` with `s = list(map(int, list(input().strip())))`.

7. **Correctness**:
   - After correcting the input processing, the logic in `func_1` is correct for calculating the minimum total cost to sort the binary string.
   - The logic correctly counts the number of 1s and adds the cost of cyclic shifts when a 0 is encountered after some 1s.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the improper handling of the input string in `func_1`. The input should be read as a single string and then converted to a list of integers. Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, list(input().strip())))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for the given problem.
