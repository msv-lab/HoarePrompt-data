Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 1, `result` is a list. `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is an even integer or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is an odd integer, and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.**

Explanation:
- The code `space_x = x * 1` does not change the value of `space_x` because multiplying `x` by 1 results in `x` itself.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
