Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 4`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `v[x]` incremented by 1, `cnt` is 0, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the total number of pairs and triplets of indices where the values in `data` are the same, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `x = int(data[idx])` updates the value of `x` to the integer value of the string at the index `idx` in the list `data`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The initial state conditions for `t`, `idx`, `data`, `results`, `n`, `v`, `cnt`, `i`, and `ans` are still valid.
- The new value of `x` is the integer value of the string at index `idx` in `data`.
