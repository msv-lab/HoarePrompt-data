Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers representing the input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, or 3, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, where `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. `l` must be less than `r`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, where `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
