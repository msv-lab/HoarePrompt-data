The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ele` and the list `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If the list `l` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are positive integers, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is 0, and `maxi` is 0. For the loop to be executed, the list `l` must have at least one element, and `ele` should be the first element in the list.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`**
