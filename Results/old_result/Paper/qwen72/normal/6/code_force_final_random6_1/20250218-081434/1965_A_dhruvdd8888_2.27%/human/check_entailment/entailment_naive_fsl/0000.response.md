Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the game logic as described. Specifically, it incorrectly processes the input and makes assumptions that are not always valid. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Alice
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Bob
```

The program incorrectly returns "Bob" because it assumes that if there are only two distinct pile sizes, Bob wins. However, in this case, Alice can win by removing 1 stone from each pile on her first turn, leaving Bob with two empty piles and one pile of size 1, which he cannot make a move on. Therefore, the program does not correctly determine the winner for all potential cases.
