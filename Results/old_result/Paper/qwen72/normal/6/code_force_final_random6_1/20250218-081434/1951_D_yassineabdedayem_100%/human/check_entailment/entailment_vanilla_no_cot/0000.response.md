Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem based on the given constraints and requirements. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Base Case (n == k)**: If Alice has exactly `k` coins, Bob can set up a single stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels from this stall, and the program correctly outputs "YES" followed by the number of stalls (1) and the price (1).

3. **Second Case (n + 2 > k * 2)**: This condition checks if it is possible to set up two stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The condition `n + 2 > k * 2` simplifies to `n > k * 2 - 2`, which means Alice has enough coins to buy `k-1` jewels at a higher price and 1 jewel at a lower price. The program sets up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`. This ensures that Alice buys `k-1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling `k` jewels. The program correctly outputs "YES" followed by the number of stalls (2) and the prices.

4. **Third Case (n + 2 <= k * 2)**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it means Alice does not have enough coins to buy exactly `k` jewels using at most 60 stalls. The program correctly outputs "NO" in this case.

The logic and conditions used in the program are sound and cover all the necessary cases to determine if Bob can set up the stalls to make Alice buy exactly `k` jewels. The program also ensures that the number of stalls and the prices are within the specified limits. Therefore, the program is correct.
