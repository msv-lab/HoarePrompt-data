Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is a list containing `[1]`, `output2` is a list containing `[x]`, `i` is 1, and `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).**

The code `output2.append(int(x / i))` adds the integer result of `x` divided by `i` to the list `output2`. Since `i` is 1, the value of `x` itself is appended to `output2`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
