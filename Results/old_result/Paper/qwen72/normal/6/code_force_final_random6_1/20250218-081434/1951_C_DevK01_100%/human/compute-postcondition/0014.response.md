Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a list of integers converted from the input provided by the user and sorted in ascending order, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second and third integers in `L`, `k` is the third integer in `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M` minus the last element, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**

The code snippet `mu = k - (n - 1) * m` calculates the value of `mu` based on the values of `k`, `n`, and `m`. The value of `mu` is now equal to `k - (n - 1) * m`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
