The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the value `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `m` and the current iteration count represented by `_`.

At the end of the last iteration, `ans` and `temp` are sets containing the same values, and `_` has just completed an iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented by 1, and `m` must be greater than the current value of `_`.

State: **`ans` is a set containing all the values that were added to `temp` during the loop iterations, which are the same as the final values in `temp`. `temp` is a set containing all the values that were added to it during the loop iterations, which are the same as the final values in `ans`. `_` is incremented by 1, `m` must be greater than the current value of `_`**
