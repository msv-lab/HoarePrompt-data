### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The game involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at positions \( P_B \) and \( P_S \) respectively.
   - Each player can either stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation \( p \).
   - The game lasts for \( k \) turns, and the score for each player is determined by the sum of the values in array \( a \) at the positions they visit.
   - The goal is to determine the winner after \( k \) turns.

2. **Function 1: `func_1`**
   - This function calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").
   - The function is logically correct and follows the problem's requirements.

3. **Function 2: `calculate_score`**
   - This function calculates the score for a given starting position.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to track the positions visited and detect cycles.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by leveraging the cycle length and cycle score.
   - The function correctly handles both the non-cyclic and cyclic parts of the permutation.
   - The logic for detecting cycles and calculating the score is sound and follows the problem's requirements.

4. **Function 3: `func_2`**
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The function appends the results to a list and prints them at the end.
   - The input parsing and test case handling are correct and efficient.

5. **Edge Cases and Performance:**
   - The program handles the constraints \( 1 \le t \le 10^4 \), \( 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 \), and \( 1 \le k \le 10^9 \) effectively.
   - The use of a dictionary to track visited positions ensures that cycle detection is efficient.
   - The program correctly handles large values of \( k \) by using cycle properties to avoid unnecessary iterations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is logically correct and efficiently handles the problem's constraints and requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
