Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= n, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` >= `find`, or `l` is n if no such index exists. `r` is the largest index such that `array[r]` < `find`, or `r` is -1 if no such index exists.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `l` will hold the smallest index in the array where the value is greater than or equal to `find`. If no such index exists, `l` will be equal to `n`, indicating that `find` is greater than all elements in the array. The variable `r` will hold the largest index in the array where the value is less than `find`. If no such index exists, `r` will be -1, indicating that `find` is less than or equal to all elements in the array. The loop effectively narrows down the search range until `l` and `r` converge to the correct positions.
