Output State: **`L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input provided by the user, `n` is the number of elements in `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second integer in `L` and the third integer in `L`, `k` is the third integer in `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, `mu` is not yet defined.**

Explanation:
- `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
  - `sum(N)` is the sum of the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`.
  - `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` is a calculation involving `m` and `n`, where `n` is the number of elements in `N`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
