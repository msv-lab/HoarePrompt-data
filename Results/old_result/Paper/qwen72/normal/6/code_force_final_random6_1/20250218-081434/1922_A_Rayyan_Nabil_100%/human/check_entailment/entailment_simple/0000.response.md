### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates through each character of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It checks if the character at the current index `i` in `a` and `b` is different from the character at the same index in `c`.
   - If such a condition is met for any index `i`, it returns 'YES'.
   - If no such index is found, it returns 'NO'.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct for determining if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not.
   - The condition `if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` ensures that for at least one position `i`, the characters in `a` and `b` are different from the character in `c`, which is necessary for `a` and `b` to match the template and `c` to not match it.
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, storing and printing the results.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1.
   - It also handles the case where all characters in `a` and `b` are the same as the corresponding characters in `c`, correctly returning 'NO'.
