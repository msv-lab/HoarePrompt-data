Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr)`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum encountered during the loop, `new_segment` is either an empty list or the segment that is currently being built, `segments_variants` is a list of segments that were considered as potential max segments but were discarded because a higher sum segment was found, and it must contain at least one element. `max_sum` remains -1, `total_max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum from `segments_variants` that has more than one element, or remains [-1] if no such segment exists.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each segment in `segments_variants`.
- For each segment, if the sum of the segment is greater than the sum of `total_max_segment` and the segment has more than one element, `total_max_segment` is updated to that segment.
- After all iterations, `total_max_segment` will hold the segment with the highest sum that has more than one element, or it will remain as [-1] if no such segment exists.
- The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `max_segment`, `new_segment`, `segments_variants`, and `max_sum`) are not modified by the loop and retain their initial values.
