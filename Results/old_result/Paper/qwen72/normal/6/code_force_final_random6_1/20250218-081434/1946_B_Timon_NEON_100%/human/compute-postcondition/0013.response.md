Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, then `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is [0, 0, -1]. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to be equal to `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [i - 1].**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `new_segment = []` reassigns `new_segment` to an empty list.
- The values of `arr`, `i`, `max_sum`, and `arr[i]` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `segments_variants` and `max_segment` remains the same as in the initial state, but `new_segment` is now an empty list.
