Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Specifically, it does not ensure that Alice and Bob are playing optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX, respectively. The program simply checks for the first missing integer and prints it, which is not the correct approach for the game described.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4
0 1 2 2
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Actual Output:
```
3
```

However, the optimal play should result in a different output:

  1. Alice picks 2. Now, `a = [0, 1, 2]` and `c = [2]`.
  2. Bob picks 0. Now, `a = [1, 2]` and `c = [2]`.
  3. Alice picks 1. Now, `a = [2]` and `c = [2, 1]`.
  4. Bob picks 2. Now, `a = []` and `c = [2, 1]`.

The MEX of `c = [2, 1]` is 0, not 3. The program does not correctly simulate the optimal play of the game.
