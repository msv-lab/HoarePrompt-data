The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`. The loop can execute one more time if the value of `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` was incremented by 1, and `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `_` is a placeholder variable incremented by 1.
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be within its valid range (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is a placeholder variable incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are the first and second integers in the input line, respectively. If `n` is equal to `k`, the current values of `n` and `k` remain equal. If `n` is not equal to `k`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` or `n + 2 <= k * 2` holds, depending on the values of `n` and `k`.**
