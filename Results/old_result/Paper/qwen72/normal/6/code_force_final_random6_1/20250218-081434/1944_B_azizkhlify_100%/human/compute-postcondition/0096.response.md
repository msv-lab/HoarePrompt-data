Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is the last element in `res` + 1, `k` is `2 * k - ul`, `res` is a non-empty list that has been fully iterated, and `ul` is not equal to `ur` unless the condition `ul == ur` is met. If `ul == ur`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `r[a[i] - 1]` remains 2, and if `r[a[i] - 1]` is not 2, `r[a[i] - 1]` remains 0, and `ur` is incremented by 2.***
