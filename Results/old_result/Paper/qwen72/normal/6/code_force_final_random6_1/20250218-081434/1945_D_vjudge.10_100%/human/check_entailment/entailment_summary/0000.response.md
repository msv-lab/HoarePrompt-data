### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Kirill wants to move up in a queue to be among the first `m` people.
   - He can bribe people to move to a position `j` where `j < i` and pay `a_j` coins to the person at position `j`.
   - Additionally, for each person between `j` and `i`, Kirill pays `b_k` coins.
   - The goal is to minimize the total number of coins Kirill spends to achieve this.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the lists `a` and `b`.
   - It initializes `pergunta` to infinity, which is intended to store the minimum cost.
   - It then iterates backward from the last person in the queue to the first.
   - For each person, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of its current value and the sum of `x` and `a[i]` if `i < m`.
   - `x` is updated by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each person.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `pergunta`.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with `pergunta` as a parameter, but `pergunta` is not modified within the function. Instead, a local variable `pergunta` is used, which shadows the global `pergunta`.
   - The function should update the global `pergunta` or return the result to be printed correctly.
   - The logic for updating `pergunta` and `x` seems to be correct in terms of the problem's constraints and the goal of minimizing the cost.

4. **Correcting the Program:**
   - To fix the issue, the function `func_1` should either return the result or modify the global `pergunta` directly.
   - Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
numCasos = int(input())
for i in range(numCasos):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pergunta = float('inf')
    pergunta = func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m)
    print(pergunta)

def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
    return pergunta
```

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The original program does not correctly update the global `pergunta` variable, leading to incorrect results.
   - The logic within the function `func_1` is correct, but the way it is used in the main loop is flawed.

### Correctness: **False**
