Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list that contains the first element of `cur_arr` if the bit at position `bit` in the first element of `cur_arr` is 0, otherwise `new_arr` contains the value of `xor`. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, `xor` is set to 0 and `thing1` remains 0.***
