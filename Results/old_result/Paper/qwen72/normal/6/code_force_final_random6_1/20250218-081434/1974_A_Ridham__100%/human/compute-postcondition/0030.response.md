Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 1, `result` is a list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` updates the value of `screen_require_for_y`.
- `screen_require_for_y` is now explicitly set to `y // 2 + 1`, which means it is always `y // 2 + 1` regardless of whether `y` is even or odd.
- The other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `result`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, and `remaining_cells`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `remaining_cells` is still calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, but now `screen_require_for_y` is always `y // 2 + 1`.
