Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 2`, `path` contains at most one vertex (if a suitable `v` was found and added), `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any). `v` and `u` are now assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`. The program continues with the current iteration.**
