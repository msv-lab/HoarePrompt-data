Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code snippet).
3. `n` is greater than 0.
4. `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
5. `tmp` is equal to the first integer in the list `a`.
6. `i` is `n-1`.
7. `cnt` is the number of times the integer `tmp` appears consecutively at the end of the list `a`.
8. `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive appearances of `tmp` found in the list `a` before the last sequence.
9. `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
10. `n` is not equal to 1.
11. `ans` is not equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a` and `tmp`**:
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`.

2. **Index `i`**:
   - `i` is set to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`.

3. **Count `cnt`**:
   - `cnt` is the number of times `tmp` appears consecutively at the end of the list `a`.

4. **Variable `ans`**:
   - `ans` is initially the minimum count of consecutive appearances of `tmp` found in the list `a` before the last sequence.
   - `ans` is then updated to the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.

5. **Constraints**:
   - `n` is not equal to 1, meaning the list `a` has at least one element.
   - `ans` is not equal to `n`, meaning the minimum count of consecutive appearances of `tmp` is less than the total length of the list.

### Determining the Output:
- The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the minimum count of consecutive appearances of `tmp` found in the list `a` before the last sequence, updated to the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `cnt` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum count of consecutive appearances of tmp found in the list a before the last sequence, updated to the minimum value between the previous ans and cnt)**
