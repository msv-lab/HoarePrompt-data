Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element. If `x` == `y`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `a`, and if `a` was empty, `x` is now `lit[1]`; if `a` was not empty, `x` is now the last element of `a` which is `lit[1]`. If `x` is not equal to `y`, and `lit[i]` is greater than or equal to `x`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `a`, and `x` is now the last element of `a`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `b`, and `y` is now the last element of `b`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to both `x` and `y`, or if `x` is not less than `y`, the state of `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` remains unchanged.***
