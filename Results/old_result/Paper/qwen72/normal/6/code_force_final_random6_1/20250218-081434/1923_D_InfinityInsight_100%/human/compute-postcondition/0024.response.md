Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\), `left` is a list containing the integer 0 followed by the cumulative sums of all elements in `a`, `last` is a list of length \(n\) where the first element is -1 and subsequent elements are the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in `a` up to that point, `ans` is a list of length \(n\), where each element is -1, and `i` has been set to each element of `a` during the loop.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- The list `left` now contains the integer 0 followed by the cumulative sums of all elements in `a`.
- The list `last` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The list `ans` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` has been set to each element of `a` during the loop, but it is not retained after the loop completes.
