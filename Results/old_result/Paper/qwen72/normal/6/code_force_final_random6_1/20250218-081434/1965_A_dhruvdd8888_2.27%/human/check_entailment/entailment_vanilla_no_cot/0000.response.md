Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Function Call and Placement:**
   - The function `func_1()` is called inside a loop, but it is defined after the loop. In Python, functions must be defined before they are called. This will result in a `NameError` when the program is executed.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Input:**
   - The function `func_1()` is called without passing any arguments, but it should be designed to handle the input for each test case. The function should read the number of piles and the pile sizes within its scope.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner:**
   - The logic for determining the winner is flawed. The program checks if the number of consecutive differences of 1 in the sorted pile sizes is odd or even. However, this does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The correct approach involves checking the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones.

### Correct Approach:

To determine the winner, you should:
- Read the number of piles and the pile sizes for each test case.
- Count the number of piles that have an odd number of stones.
- If the count of odd piles is odd, Alice wins. If the count is even, Bob wins.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    odd_count = sum(1 for num in nums if num % 2 == 1)
    if odd_count % 2 == 1:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        print('Bob')

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

This program correctly reads the input, counts the number of odd piles, and determines the winner based on the parity of the count.
