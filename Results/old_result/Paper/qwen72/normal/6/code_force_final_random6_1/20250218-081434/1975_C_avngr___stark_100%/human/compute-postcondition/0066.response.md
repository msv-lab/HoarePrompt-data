Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `temp` is a list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` in the order they appear in `a`. If `temp[1]` > `max`, then `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`. Otherwise, `max` remains 0.**
