The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0, and `n` should be at least 2 to ensure the loop executes at least once.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is `n-2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where the first inequality was found, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first integer in the list `num`, `symb2` is the last integer in the list `num`, `i` is 0**
