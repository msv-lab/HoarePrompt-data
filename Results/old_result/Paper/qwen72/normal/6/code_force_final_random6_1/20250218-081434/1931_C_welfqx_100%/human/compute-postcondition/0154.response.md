Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ii` is `n-2`, `ck` is 1, `r` is `r+1`, `t` is greater than `r+1`, `f` is 1, `j` is `n-2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where the first inequality is found, `onum` is a reversed copy of the list `num`, `cn` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of the list `num`, and `symb2` remains unchanged.**
