Output State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[2] // gcd(g, l[2])`, `bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a[j]` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is increased by the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space, `T` is `T + 1`, `t` must be greater than `T`, `l` is a list that must have at least 2 elements.**
