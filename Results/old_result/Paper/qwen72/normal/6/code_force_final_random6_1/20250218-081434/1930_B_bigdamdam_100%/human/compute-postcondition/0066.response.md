Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is the last even number less than `n`, `p` is a list where every even-indexed element (starting from index 0) is filled with values in descending order starting from `n` and decreasing by 2, and the rest of the elements are zeros, `ind` is 1 + n % 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ind` is updated to `1 + n % 2`.
- If `n` is even, `n % 2` is 0, so `ind` becomes 1.
- If `n` is odd, `n % 2` is 1, so `ind` becomes 2.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, and `p`) remain unchanged.
