### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding a Hamiltonian path in a graph where \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed from a complete undirected graph with \( n \) vertices.
   - The interaction involves querying the graph to find a vertex \( v \) with a degree at least \( d \) and another vertex \( u \) not connected to \( v \).
   - The goal is to use at most \( n \) queries to construct the Hamiltonian path.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function makes a query to the interactor with a given degree \( d \).
     - It prints the query in the format "? d" and reads the response, which is a tuple \((v, u)\).
     - The function correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - This function initializes a list `path` to store the vertices of the Hamiltonian path and a set `remaining_vertices` to keep track of the vertices that have not been added to the path.
     - It iterates over possible degrees \( d \) from \( n-1 \) down to 0.
     - For each degree \( d \), it calls `func_1` to get the vertex \( v \) and another vertex \( u \).
     - If \( v \) is 0, it continues to the next degree.
     - If \( v \) is a valid vertex (i.e., it is in the set of remaining vertices), it adds \( v \) to the path and removes it from the set of remaining vertices.
     - The process continues until all vertices are added to the path.
     - Finally, it prints the Hamiltonian path and flushes the output buffer.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - **Vertex Selection:**
     - The algorithm correctly selects a vertex \( v \) with the minimum degree among the vertices with a degree at least \( d \).
     - It also ensures that the selected vertex \( v \) is not connected to another vertex \( u \) with the minimum number.
   - **Graph Reduction:**
     - By removing \( v \) and its edges, the algorithm guarantees that the next query will consider the updated graph.
   - **Query Limit:**
     - The algorithm uses at most \( n \) queries, as it will stop once all vertices are added to the path.
   - **Hamiltonian Path Construction:**
     - The Hamiltonian path is constructed by adding vertices one by one, ensuring that each vertex is connected to the next in the path.
     - The algorithm ensures that all vertices are included in the path and that the path is valid.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Vertex:**
     - The program handles the case where the graph is reduced to a single vertex by ensuring that the set of remaining vertices is empty before the loop ends.
   - **No Valid Vertex:**
     - The program correctly handles the case where \( v \) is 0 by continuing to the next degree.
   - **Graph with Few Edges:**
     - The program correctly handles graphs where \( n - 2 \) edges are removed, ensuring that the remaining graph still has a Hamiltonian path.

5. **Output and Interaction:**
   - The program correctly flushes the output buffer after each query and after reporting the path.
   - It follows the interaction rules as specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by constructing a Hamiltonian path using at most \( n \) queries. It handles all edge cases and follows the interaction rules.

Final: **True**
