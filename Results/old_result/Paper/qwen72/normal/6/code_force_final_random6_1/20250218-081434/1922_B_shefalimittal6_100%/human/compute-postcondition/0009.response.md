Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 2, `data` is a list of strings, each string being a part of the input data split by spaces, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.** 

The variable `v` is now a list containing `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0. The values of `t`, `idx`, `data`, `results`, and `n` remain unchanged.
