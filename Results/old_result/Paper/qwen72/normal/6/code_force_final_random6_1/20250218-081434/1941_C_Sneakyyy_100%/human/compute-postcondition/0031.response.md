Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0.**

The value of `i` is reset to 0, and the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. The initial state specified that `i` was the length of the new `a` minus 2 or the index just after the last processed character that was part of a 'map' or 'pie' substring, but now `i` is explicitly set to 0.
