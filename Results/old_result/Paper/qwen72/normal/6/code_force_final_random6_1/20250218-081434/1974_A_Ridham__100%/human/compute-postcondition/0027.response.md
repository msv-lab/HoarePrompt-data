Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 1, `result` is a list. `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is an even integer or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is an odd integer, and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `space_y` is updated to `y * 4`.
- `total_space` is recalculated as `space_y + space_x`, which is now `y * 4 + x`.
- `screen_require_for_y` remains the same as it is calculated based on the value of `y`.
- `remaining_cells` is recalculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, which is now `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `result`, `space_x`, `screen_require_for_y`) retain their initial values or conditions.
