You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a loop or context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case provides a string `s` of length 5 consisting of letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B}. The total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, and all `t` strings are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, `s` is an input string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `q` is `t-1`, `ac` is the number of 'A' characters in the last input string `s`, and `bc` is the number of 'B' characters in the last input string `s`.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: B
    #State: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, `s` is an input string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `q` is `t-1`, `ac` is the number of 'A' characters in the last input string `s`, and `bc` is the number of 'B' characters in the last input string `s`. If `ac` > `bc`, the number of 'A' characters in `s` is greater than the number of 'B' characters in `s`. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each providing a distinct string `s` of length 5 consisting of letters `A` and `B`. The total number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 32. After processing all test cases, the function prints either 'A' or 'B' based on the last input string `s`: it prints 'A' if the number of 'A' characters in `s` is greater than the number of 'B' characters, and 'B' otherwise. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and then iterates `t` times to process each test case. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **String Processing**: For each test case, the program initializes two counters, `ac` and `bc`, to zero. It then reads a string `s` of length 5 and iterates through each character in the string. If the character is 'A', it increments `ac`; otherwise, it increments `bc`.

3. **Output Determination**: After processing the string, the program checks which counter is greater (`ac` or `bc`). If `ac` is greater, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. This logic is correct for determining which character appears more frequently in the string.

4. **Indentation Issue**: The program has an indentation issue. The `if ac > bc` block should be inside the loop that processes each test case. As it is currently written, the `if ac > bc` block is outside the loop, meaning it will only be executed after all test cases have been processed, and it will only print the result for the last test case.

5. **Correct Indentation**: To fix the indentation issue, the `if ac > bc` block should be indented to be inside the loop that processes each test case. This ensures that the program prints the result for each test case immediately after processing it.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
```

### Correctness:
Given the original program, the indentation issue makes it incorrect. Therefore, the original program is:

Correctness: **False**

However, the corrected program (with proper indentation) is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.
