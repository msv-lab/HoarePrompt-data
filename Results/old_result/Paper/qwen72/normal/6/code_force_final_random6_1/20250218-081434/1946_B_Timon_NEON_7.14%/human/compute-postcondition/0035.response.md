Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is [arr[1], 1], `max_segment` is [arr[0], 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [0] if `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `new_segment[0]`, otherwise it is [0, 0, -1].**

Explanation:
- The code `new_segment = [arr[i], i]` updates the `new_segment` variable.
- Since `i` is 1, `new_segment` is now `[arr[1], 1]`.
- The values of `arr`, `i`, `max_sum`, `max_segment`, and `segments_variants` remain unchanged from the initial state.
