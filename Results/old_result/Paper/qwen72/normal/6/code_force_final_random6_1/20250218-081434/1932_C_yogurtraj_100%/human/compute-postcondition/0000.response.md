The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ii` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `ii` will start from 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`ii` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
