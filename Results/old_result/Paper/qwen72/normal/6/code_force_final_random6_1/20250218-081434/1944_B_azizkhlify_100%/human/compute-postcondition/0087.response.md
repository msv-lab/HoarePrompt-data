Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is the last element in `res`, `k` is `2 * k - ul`, `res` is a non-empty list that has been fully iterated, `ul` is not equal to `ur`. However, the condition `ul == ur` is true, which means that the value of `ul` must have been adjusted to match `ur`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2 before entering the if condition, then `ur` is `ur + 2` and the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0.**
