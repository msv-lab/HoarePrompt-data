Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively.
- `ldb` must have at least two elements.
- `elem` is the second element in `ldb`.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `sz` remains 0. Otherwise, `sz` remains 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`elem`**: According to the initial state, `elem` is the second element in the list `ldb`. Since `ldb` must have at least two elements, `elem` is well-defined and will be the second element of `ldb`.

2. **`end=' '`**: The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline. This means the output will not move to the next line after printing the elements.

3. **Output**: The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Since `elem` is the second element in `ldb`, the output will be:
Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the second element in the list `ldb`)**
