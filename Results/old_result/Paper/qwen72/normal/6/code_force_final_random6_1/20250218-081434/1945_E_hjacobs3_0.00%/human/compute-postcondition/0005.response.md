The value of `r` is updated to `mid - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= n, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is (n - 1) // 2 - 1, `mid` is (n - 1) // 2, and the element at the middle index of `array` (i.e., `array[mid]`) is greater than or equal to `find`.**
