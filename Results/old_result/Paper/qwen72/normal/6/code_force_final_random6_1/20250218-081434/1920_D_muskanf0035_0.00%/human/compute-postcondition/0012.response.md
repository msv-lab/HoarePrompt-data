To determine what will be printed by the `print(*result)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the context of the variables and objects involved.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `n` and `q` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5.
- `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains two integers provided by the user.
- `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user.
- `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.
- `_` is incremented by 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).

### Analysis:
- The function `func_1(n, operations, queries)` is called with the parameters `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.
- The function `func_1` is expected to process the `operations` and `queries` and return a result, which is stored in the variable `result`.
- The `print(*result)` statement will unpack the `result` list and print its elements separated by spaces.

### Determining the Output:
- Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can only describe the output based on the given information.
- The `result` is a list of values returned by `func_1`, and the `print(*result)` statement will print these values separated by spaces.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the elements of the `result` list, separated by spaces. The exact values of these elements depend on the implementation of `func_1`, but they are the results of processing the `operations` and `queries` lists.

Output: **[elements of result separated by spaces] (where result is the list returned by func_1(n, operations, queries))**
