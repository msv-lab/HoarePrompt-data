Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`. `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a` during the loop execution.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the length of the list `a`.
- The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, ending at `n-1`.
- The variable `cnt` keeps track of the number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` (the first element of `a`).
- The variable `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `cnt` whenever a different element is encountered in `a`.
- After all iterations, `cnt` will be the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the list, and `ans` will be the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found throughout the list.
