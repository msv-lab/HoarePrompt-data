Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, and the function `func_1` has been called `t` times.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop. The placeholder `_` is used in the loop and does not need adjustment. The function `func_1` has been called exactly `t` times, as the loop runs `t` times.
