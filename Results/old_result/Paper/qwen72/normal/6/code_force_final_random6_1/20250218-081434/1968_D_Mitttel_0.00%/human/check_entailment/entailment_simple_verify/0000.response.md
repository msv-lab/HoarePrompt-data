### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Parsing:**
   - The `func_2` function correctly reads the input and parses it into the necessary variables for each test case. The input is read as a single string and split into a list of strings, which are then converted to integers as needed. This ensures that the input is processed correctly and efficiently.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - The `calculate_score` function is designed to compute the score for a player starting from a given position. It correctly handles the game mechanics by:
     - Initializing the score and current position.
     - Using a dictionary `visited` to track the steps at which each position is visited, which helps in detecting cycles.
     - Summing the values from the array `a` at the positions visited.
     - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the cycle length and cycle score, then uses this information to efficiently compute the score for the remaining steps.

3. **Cycle Detection and Handling:**
   - The cycle detection logic in `calculate_score` is sound. When a cycle is detected, the function correctly computes the cycle length and the score for one full cycle. It then calculates the number of full cycles that can fit into the remaining steps and the score for the remaining steps after the full cycles.

4. **Final Score Comparison:**
   - The `func_1` function compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha after calling `calculate_score` for each player. It returns the appropriate result based on the comparison:
     - "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher.
     - "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher.
     - "Draw" if both scores are equal.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as:
     - When the game duration `k` is 1.
     - When the starting positions `PB` and `PS` are the same.
     - When the permutation `p` and array `a` are very large (up to the constraints provided).

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The program is efficient in terms of both time and space. The cycle detection and score calculation are done in linear time relative to the number of steps `k`, and the space complexity is also linear due to the use of the `visited` dictionary.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all the specified constraints and edge cases. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
