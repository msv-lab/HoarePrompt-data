Functionality: **The function is intended to accept parameters `t`, `a`, and `b`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 1000), and `a` and `b` are the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters, making it inconsistent with the expected functionality. The function should return results based on the input parameters for each test case, but the specific return values are not defined in the given output.**
