Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order and must have at least 1 element.
   - `k` is decreased by `dic[l[1]]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The values of `i`, `l`, and `k` are not directly involved in the `print` statement, so their specific values do not affect what is printed.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
