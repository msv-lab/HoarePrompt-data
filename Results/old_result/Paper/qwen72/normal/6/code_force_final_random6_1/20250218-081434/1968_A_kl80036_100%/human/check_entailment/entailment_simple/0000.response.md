### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The provided program sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \) and prints it for each test case.

To determine if this approach is correct, let's analyze the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \):

1. **GCD Analysis**:
   - When \( y = x - 1 \), the greatest common divisor \( \gcd(x, y) \) is always 1. This is because \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) are consecutive integers, and the GCD of two consecutive integers is always 1.
   - Therefore, \( \gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = 1 + (x-1) = x \).

2. **Maximizing the Expression**:
   - The expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized when \( y \) is as large as possible while still being less than \( x \). Since \( y = x - 1 \) is the largest possible value for \( y \) that satisfies \( 1 \le y < x \), and it results in \( \gcd(x, y) + y = x \), this is indeed the maximum possible value.

3. **Output Verification**:
   - The program correctly prints \( y = x - 1 \) for each test case, which is the correct value to maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct because it always outputs \( y = x - 1 \), which is the value that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
