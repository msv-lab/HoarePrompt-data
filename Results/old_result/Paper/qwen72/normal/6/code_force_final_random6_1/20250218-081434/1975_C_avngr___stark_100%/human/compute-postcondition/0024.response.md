Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]`. If the second smallest element in `temp` is greater than `max`, `max` is updated to this second smallest element. Otherwise, `max` retains its previous value.***
