Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers and `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers. It returns the total number of elements removed from `nums` that were reduced to 0. If the list `nums` ends up containing exactly one positive integer and `k` is greater than or equal to this integer, the function returns the total count of removed elements plus 1. Otherwise, it returns just the total count of removed elements. After the function concludes, `nums` is a deque containing 0 or 1 positive integers, and `k` is the remaining value after subtracting the total cost of removing the minimum elements from `nums` in pairs. **
