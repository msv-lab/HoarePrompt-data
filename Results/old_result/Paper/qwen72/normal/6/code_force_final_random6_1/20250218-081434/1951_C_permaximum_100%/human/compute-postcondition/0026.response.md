Output State: **`total_cost` is the total cost of buying `k` tickets, `tickets_bought` is `k`, `price_increase` is the sum of the number of tickets bought in each iteration, and `pq` is now a heap with the first `k` smallest tuples removed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The `total_cost` variable will hold the total cost incurred by buying `k` tickets.
- The `tickets_bought` variable will be equal to `k`, indicating that the desired number of tickets has been purchased.
- The `price_increase` variable will be the sum of the number of tickets bought in each iteration of the loop, reflecting the cumulative increase in the price of tickets.
- The `pq` heap will have the first `k` smallest tuples removed, as each iteration of the loop removes the smallest tuple and buys tickets based on that tuple's price and day.
