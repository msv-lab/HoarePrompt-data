### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case.
   - Inside the loop, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` for each test case.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is called without any arguments, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The function should be defined to accept the test case parameters, but it is not.
   - However, the function `func_1` itself reads the input directly, which means it can still process the test cases correctly, even though it is not defined with parameters.

3. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - The function counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.
   - The penalty is calculated using the formula `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n`.
   - This formula is derived from the observation that:
     - If the number of '+' and '-' characters is not equal, the optimal split is to keep each '-' character in its own subarray and group all '+' characters together. This minimizes the penalty because the penalty for a subarray with a single '-' character is 1, and the penalty for a subarray with all '+' characters is `n - neg`.
     - If the number of '+' and '-' characters is equal, the optimal split is to pair each '+' with a '-' in the same subarray, resulting in a penalty of 0 for each pair. The total penalty is then `n` because each character is in its own subarray.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated penalty for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

### Correctness:
- Despite the function `func_1` not being defined with parameters, it still correctly processes the input and calculates the minimum possible penalty.
- The logic for calculating the penalty is correct and matches the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct in terms of functionality and output, even though the function definition does not match the problem description's requirements.

**Correctness: True**
