Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`, `a[2]` must be equal to `a[3]`, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 1` and `r` must be greater than 1, `st` is 2, `end` is 0, `ans` is 0**

The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so `l` is now 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
