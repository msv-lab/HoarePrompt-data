Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise `flag` is False, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index where the first inequality was found, `ans` is the minimum of the lengths of consecutive sequences of `val` in `arr` if any inequality was found, otherwise `ans` is the minimum of `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt`, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is the length of the last consecutive sequence of `val` in `arr` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.
- If `flag` is True, it means all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to `arr[0]`, and the loop completes without breaking. In this case, `ans` remains `Decimal('Infinity')` because `cnt` is the length of the last consecutive sequence of `val` in `arr`, which is `n`.
- If `flag` is False, it means there was an inequality found, and `ans` is the minimum of the lengths of consecutive sequences of `val` in `arr`. The value of `cnt` is 0, so `ans` remains the minimum of the lengths of consecutive sequences of `val` in `arr`.
- The values of `n`, `arr`, `flag`, `i`, `val`, and `cnt` remain unchanged except for the update to `ans` as described.
