Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for all `i`, and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5). `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `freq[j]` represents the number of times the integer `j` appears in `arr`. `cou` is 1 or 2, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `freq[1]` is greater than or equal to 2, we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if not in a loop.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cou` is incremented by 1. Since `cou` was initially 0 or 1, after the increment, `cou` is now 1 or 2.
- The values of `arr`, `freq`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The condition for continuing to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if `freq[1]` is greater than or equal to 2 still holds.
