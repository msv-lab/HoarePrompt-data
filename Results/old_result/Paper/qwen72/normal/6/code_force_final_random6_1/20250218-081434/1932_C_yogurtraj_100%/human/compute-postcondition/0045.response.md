The code snippet provided updates the values of `n` and `m` by reading two integers from the input and converting them to integers using the `map` function. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of times 'L' appears in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where the last element is `k` (which is `a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `a[l] % m`), `q1` is `l - 2 - (n - 1)` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and the number of 'R' characters in `t` is less than `n - 1`, otherwise `l - 1 - (n - 1)`, `q2` is `l + (n - 1)` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and the number of 'R' characters in `t` is less than `n - 1`, otherwise `l + 1 + (n - 1)`, `i` is -1, and `y` is fully populated with the values of `k` after each iteration of the loop.**
