You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_5` does not take any parameters. However, it reads input values where `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and `u` and `v` are integers for each edge such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n.
def func_5():
    [n, k] = map(int, input().split())
    tree = Tree(n)
    for i in range(1, n):
        [u, v] = map(int, input().split())
        
        tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` nodes, and `n-1` edges have been added to the `tree` based on the user inputs.
    tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)
    print(func_4(tree, n, k))
    #This is printed: number of nodes at depth k in the tree (where k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads input values for `n` and `k` (integers where 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5) and for each edge, `u` and `v` (integers where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n). It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
