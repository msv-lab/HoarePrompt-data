Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is `x - 1`, `a` and `b` are integers based on the input, `lst[a]` is a list that includes all the `b` values appended during the iterations, `lst[b]` is a list that includes all the `a` values appended during the iterations, `s` is True.
Code of the loop:
while lst[x] != []:
    while lst[x]:
        y = lst[x].pop()
        if lst[y] != []:
            x = y
            break
    s = not s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop will terminate when `lst[x]` becomes empty. At this point, `x` will be the last value of `y` that caused the loop to break, and `lst[x]` will be an empty list. The variables `a`, `b`, and `_` will remain unchanged from their initial values. `s` is now the opposite of its initial value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The loop will terminate when `lst[x]` becomes empty. At this point, `x` will be the last value of `y` that caused the loop to break, and `lst[x]` will be an empty list. The variables `a`, `b`, and `_` will remain unchanged from their initial values. `s` is now the opposite of its initial value, and `s` is now `not s`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The loop will continue to execute until `lst[x]` becomes an empty list. At that point, `lst[x]` will be an empty list, `y` will be the last element that was removed from `lst[x]` during the final iteration, and `s` will be the opposite of its previous value. The values of `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged. If at any point `lst[y]` is not an empty list, `x` will be set to `y` and the loop will break.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
