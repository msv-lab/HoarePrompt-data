Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is `x - 1`, `a` and `b` are integers based on the input, `lst[a]` is a list that includes all the `b` values appended during the iterations, `lst[b]` is a list that includes all the `a` values appended during the iterations, `s` is True, and `lst[x]` is a list with at least one element. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, `x` is equal to the last element of `lst[x]` before the operation, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `lst[y]` is an empty list, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
