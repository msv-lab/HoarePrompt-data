Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y`.**

The code snippet `mod_y_key = num % y` assigns the value of `num % y` to `mod_y_key`. Since `mod_y` was already set to `num % y`, `mod_y_key` now holds the same value as `mod_y`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
