Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list, `cp` is 0, `i` is -1, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` now includes the element `lit[i]` at its end, `y` is updated to `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x` and greater than `y`, `a` now includes the element `lit[i]` at its end. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a` or `b`.***
