Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` and a list of unique integers from user input, sorts the list, and determines the winner between 'Alice' and 'Bob' based on the sorted list. If the list contains only one unique integer, 'Alice' wins. If the list contains exactly two unique integers, 'Bob' wins. If the list contains more than two unique integers, the function checks for consecutive integers starting from the smallest (after inserting a 0 at the beginning of the list). If the number of such consecutive pairs is odd, 'Bob' wins; otherwise, 'Alice' wins. The function always prints the winner and returns `None`. **
