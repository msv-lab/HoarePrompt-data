Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains two integers provided by the user, `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is incremented by 1.**

The value of `result` is now the output of the function `func_1` when called with the arguments `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. The variable `_` has been incremented by 1, and the other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, `queries`) remain unchanged.
