Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are specific integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `nabors` must be greater than 0, `aa` is a list of integers input by the user, `bb` is a list of integers input by the user, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of all elements of `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements of `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements of `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, `in_aa` is `aa[m]`, `out_aa` is `aa[0]`. If `D[out_aa]` > 0, `D[out_aa]` is `D[out_aa] - 1`, `E[out_aa]` is 0, and `C[out_aa]` is `C[out_aa] + 1`. If `D[out_aa]` is 0, `E[out_aa]` is `E[out_aa] - 1`. `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, `C[in_aa]` is not equal to `D[in_aa]`, and `D[in_aa]` is `D[in_aa] + 1`.**
