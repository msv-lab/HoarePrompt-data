The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an input integer between 2 and 50. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `n` is between 2 and 50, `n + 1` is between 3 and 51, and `i` being 2 is less than `n + 1`.

State: **`v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user, `n` is an input integer between 2 and 50, `i` is 2, and `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i`**
