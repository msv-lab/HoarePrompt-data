Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`.**

The code snippet `b = int(b)` converts `b` from its initial state (the integer value of the second input string) to an integer. Since `b` was already an integer, this operation does not change its value. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain valid, and no new information is added or altered.
