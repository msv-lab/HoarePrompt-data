Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program enters a loop that runs `n` times, which is appropriate for processing each test case.

3. **Reading Test Case Input**: Inside the loop, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from a single line of input using `input().split()` and `map(int, ...)`. This is correct because the problem specifies that each test case contains three digits on a single line.

4. **Condition for Stair**: The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correct as per the problem description. If `a < b < c` is true, the program prints 'STAIR'.

5. **Condition for Peak**: The program checks if `a < b` and `b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is also correct as per the problem description. If `a < b` and `b > c` is true, the program prints 'PEAK'.

6. **Output for Other Cases**: If neither the stair nor the peak condition is met, the program outputs "NONE". This is correct as per the problem description. For example, if `a == b` or `a > b` or `b == c`, the program will print 'NONE'.

7. **Output Format**: The program prints the result for each test case on a new line, which matches the required output format.

Given the function summary and the reasoning above, the program correctly handles the input, processes the conditions, and outputs the results as specified in the problem description. There are no logical errors or issues with the implementation.

Final: **True**
