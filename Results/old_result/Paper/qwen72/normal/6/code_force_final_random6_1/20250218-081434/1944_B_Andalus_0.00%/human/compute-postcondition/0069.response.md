The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `sng` iterable. If `sng` has more elements, the loop will execute again with the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus 1, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each, separated by spaces, and `sng` must be a non-empty iterable.

For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still be a non-empty iterable, and `elem` will be the next element in `sng`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `ldb` times 2 plus 1, the loop has printed the first `min(k // 2, len(ldb))` elements of `ldb` twice each, separated by spaces, `sng` must be a non-empty iterable, `elem` is the next element in `sng`**
