Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must have at least 1 element.
   - `win` is an empty set.
   - `ans` is a list containing all characters from `s` that were added to `win` when `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters.
   - `ps` is the number of times `win` was cleared (i.e., the number of times `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters), and `ps` is less than `n`.
   - `i` is the first element of `us`, and `i` is not in `win`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` that were added to `win` when `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters.
   - `i` is the first element of `us`, which is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. Since `i` is not in `win`, it is one of the alphabets from `us`.
   - `n` is the input integer, and `ps` is the number of times `win` was cleared, which is less than `n`.
   - The print statement concatenates:
     - `''`.join(ans): This joins all characters in the list `ans` into a single string.
     - `i`: This is the first element of `us` that is not in `win`.
     - `'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)`: This creates a string of `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The string `''.join(ans)` will be the concatenation of all characters in `ans`.
   - The character `i` will be the first element of `us` that is not in `win`.
   - The string `'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)` will be a string of `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be a string composed of:
     - The characters in `ans` concatenated together.
     - The first element of `us` that is not in `win`.
     - A string of `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters.

Given the initial state and the structure of the print statement, the output can be described as:

Output: **[characters in ans] + [first element of us not in win] + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)**

This means the output will be a string that starts with the characters in `ans`, followed by the first element of `us` that is not in `win`, and then padded with `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters to make the total length of the string equal to `n`.
