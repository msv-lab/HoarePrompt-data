To determine what will be printed by the `print(x + y - z)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`a`**: This is an input integer greater than 0, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
2. **`_`**: This is a placeholder and is not used in the `print` statement.
3. **`s`**: This is an input string.
4. **`x`**: This is the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s`.
5. **`y`**: This is the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the string `s`.
6. **`z`**: This is the number of times the substring 'mapie' appears in the string `s`.

The `print` statement calculates and prints the value of `x + y - z`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
- **`x`**: Count the occurrences of the substring 'map' in `s`.
- **`y`**: Count the occurrences of the substring 'pie' in `s`.
- **`z`**: Count the occurrences of the substring 'mapie' in `s`.

The value printed will be the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' minus the count of 'mapie'.

### Explanation:
- Each occurrence of 'mapie' in `s` will be counted in both `x` and `y` because 'mapie' contains both 'map' and 'pie'. However, it should only be counted once in the final result.
- By subtracting `z` (the count of 'mapie') from the sum of `x` and `y`, we correct for the double counting of 'mapie'.

### Final Output:
Output: **x + y - z (where x is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, y is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`, and z is the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`)**
