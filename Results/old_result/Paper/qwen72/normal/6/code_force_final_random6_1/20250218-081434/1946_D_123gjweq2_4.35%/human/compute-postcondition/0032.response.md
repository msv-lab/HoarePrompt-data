The function `find_max` accepts two parameters: `cur_arr` and `bit`. `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, and `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30.

Case_1: If `bit` is 0, the function returns the length of the list `cur_arr`.

Case_2: If `bit` is not 0 and the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr` is greater, the function returns this maximum value. Here, `new_arr` is a list containing the values of `xor` at the end of each iteration where the bit at position `bit` in `xor` was 0.

Case_3: If `bit` is not 0 and the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` is greater, the function returns this result.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` (0 <= bit < 30). It returns the length of `cur_arr` if `bit` is 0. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`, where `new_arr` is a list of values of `xor` where the bit at position `bit` in `xor` was 0.**
