### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the length of the permutation.
   - The input handling is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The function initializes a list `p` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It then fills the even indices of `p` with values in descending order starting from `n` and decreasing by 2.
   - After filling the even indices, it fills the odd indices of `p` with values starting from `1 + n % 2` and increasing by 2.
   - This approach ensures that the permutation is constructed in such a way that no two consecutive elements can both divide two other consecutive elements.

3. **Validation of Permutation**:
   - **Even Indices**: The values in even indices are the largest numbers in descending order. For example, if `n = 4`, the even indices will be filled with `[4, 2]`.
   - **Odd Indices**: The values in odd indices are the smallest numbers in ascending order. For example, if `n = 4`, the odd indices will be filled with `[1, 3]`.
   - This construction ensures that the largest numbers are placed in even indices and the smallest numbers in odd indices, making it impossible for `p_i` to divide `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` to divide `p_{j+1}` for any valid `i` and `j`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the minimum value of `n` (which is 3) correctly. For `n = 3`, the permutation will be `[3, 1, 2]`, which is valid.
   - The function also handles larger values of `n` up to the maximum constraint (10^5) correctly, as the approach is consistent and does not depend on specific values of `n`.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The function prints the permutation for each test case in the required format, which is a space-separated list of integers.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly generates a permutation for each test case that satisfies the given conditions. The approach of filling even indices with large numbers in descending order and odd indices with small numbers in ascending order ensures that the permutation meets the requirement that no two consecutive elements can both divide two other consecutive elements. The input handling and output format are also correct.

### Final:
**True**
