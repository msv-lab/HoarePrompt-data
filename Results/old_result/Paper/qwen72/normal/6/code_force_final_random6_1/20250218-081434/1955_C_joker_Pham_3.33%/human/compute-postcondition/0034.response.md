Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is 0, `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2, and `sunks` is 0 or 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
