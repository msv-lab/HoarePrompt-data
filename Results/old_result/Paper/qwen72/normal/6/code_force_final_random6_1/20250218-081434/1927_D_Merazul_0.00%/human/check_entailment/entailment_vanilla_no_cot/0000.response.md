Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program appears to be attempting to solve a different problem, and its logic does not align with the requirements of finding two indices `i` and `j` within a given range `[l, r]` such that `a_i ≠ a_j` for each query. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Parsing and Structure**:
   - The program incorrectly parses the input. It uses a lambda function `R` to read integers, but the structure of the input is not handled correctly. The program does not properly read the array `a` and the queries.
   - The program reads the length of the array `k` and then reads two sets `a` and `b`, which are not part of the problem description.

2. **Logic for Finding Indices**:
   - The program does not implement any logic to find two indices `i` and `j` within the range `[l, r]` such that `a_i ≠ a_j`.
   - The program uses bitwise operations and set membership checks in a way that does not correspond to the problem's requirements.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs 'YNEOS' based on some bitwise operations, which is not the correct format for the problem. The problem requires outputting two indices or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Read the array `a` and the queries.
- For each query, check if there are any two distinct elements within the specified range `[l, r]`.
- Output the indices of such a pair if it exists, or `-1 -1` if it does not.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        q = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[idx])
            r = int(data[idx+1])
            idx += 2
            
            found = False
            for i in range(l-1, r):
                for j in range(i+1, r):
                    if a[i] != a[j]:
                        results.append(f"{i+1} {j+1}")
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if not found:
                results.append("-1 -1")
    
    print("\n".join(results))

# Example usage
solve()
```

This corrected program:
- Reads the input correctly.
- For each query, it checks if there are any two distinct elements within the range `[l, r]`.
- Outputs the indices of such a pair if it exists, or `-1 -1` if it does not.
