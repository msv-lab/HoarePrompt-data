The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. So, we can only adjust those.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `int(input())` must be greater than 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `int(input())` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `int(input())` must be greater than 2

State: **`i` is 2, `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `s` is the new input string, `a` is the integer value of the first word in the new input string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in the new input string `s`**
