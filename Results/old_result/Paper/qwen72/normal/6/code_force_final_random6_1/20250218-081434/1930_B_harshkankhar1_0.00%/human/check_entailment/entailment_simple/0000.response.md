### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and constructs a list `a` containing the integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The program then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based) of the list `a`. This means that the elements at positions 0, 2, 4, etc., are reversed in their order.
   - The resulting list is printed as the permutation.

3. **Validation of the Permutation:**
   - The goal is to ensure that there do not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - By reversing the elements at even indices, the program ensures that the permutation alternates between larger and smaller numbers, which helps in avoiding the condition where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For `n = 4`, the list `a` is initially `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - After reversing the elements at even indices, the list becomes `[4, 2, 3, 1]`.
   - This permutation is valid because:
     - `p_1 = 4` does not divide `p_3 = 3`.
     - `p_2 = 2` does not divide `p_4 = 1`.
   - For `n = 3`, the list `a` is initially `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - After reversing the elements at even indices, the list remains `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - This permutation is valid because:
     - `p_1 = 1` does not divide `p_3 = 3`.
     - `p_2 = 2` does not divide `p_4` (since `p_4` does not exist).

5. **General Case:**
   - The program's approach of reversing the elements at even indices ensures that the permutation alternates between larger and smaller numbers, which helps in avoiding the condition where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - This approach works for all valid `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) because it ensures that no two consecutive elements can both be divisors of two other consecutive elements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a permutation that meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
