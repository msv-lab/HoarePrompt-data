Output State: **`cycle_length` must be greater than 0, `cycle_score` is increased by the sum of the values of `a` at the positions visited during the entire cycle, `cycle_pos` is now equal to the position it was at the start of the cycle, `remaining_steps` is equal to `k - steps`.** 

The code snippet calculates the difference between `k` and `steps` and assigns it to `remaining_steps`. The values of `cycle_length`, `cycle_score`, and `cycle_pos` remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions.
