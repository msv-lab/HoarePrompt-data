The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` must be greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 2, `s` is `s + c * c * m + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`**
