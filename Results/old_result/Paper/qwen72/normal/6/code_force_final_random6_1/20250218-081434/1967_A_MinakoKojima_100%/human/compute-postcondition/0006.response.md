Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a`, `res` is equal to `n - 1`.** 

The value of `res` is now `n - 1`, while the other variables remain unchanged.
