Output State: **`t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is equal to `a - t1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`.
- The values of `x` and `y` remain integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 1.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `a` remains an integer.
- The value of `b` remains the integer value of the second input string.
- The value of `t1` remains `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- The value of `t2` remains `a - t1`.
