The function `func` reads input from the user to construct a tree with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges. It then performs a traversal starting from a specified node `u_1`. The traversal continues until it reaches a leaf node, toggling a boolean variable `s` with each step. The function prints 'Hermione' if the number of steps taken is odd, and 'Ron' if the number of steps taken is even. The function does not return any value.
