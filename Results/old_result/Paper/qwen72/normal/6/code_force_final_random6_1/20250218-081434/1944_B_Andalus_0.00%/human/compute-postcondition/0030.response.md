The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`). The variable `i` is already set to `n - 1`, but this is not the correct initial state for the loop to start. The loop should start with `i` being 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
