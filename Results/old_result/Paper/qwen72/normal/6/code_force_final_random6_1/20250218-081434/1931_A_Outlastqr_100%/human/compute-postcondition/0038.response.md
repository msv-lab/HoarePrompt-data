Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `word` is an empty string before the if-else block. If `n` > 52, `word` is the string formed by concatenating the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` string with 'zz'. If `n` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `word` is 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'. If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'. If `n` is between 2 and 26 (inclusive), `word` is 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3` in the string `alphabet`.***
