The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the integer `1`. The initial state provides information about variables `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, and `m`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the same value.

Output: **1**
