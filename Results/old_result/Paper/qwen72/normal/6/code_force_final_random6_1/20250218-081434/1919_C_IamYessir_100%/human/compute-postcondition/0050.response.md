Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity, and `y` is set to infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`. If `a` is non-empty, `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is non-empty, otherwise `y` is infinity.***
