Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first integer in the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`. `cnt` is the number of times the integer `tmp` appears consecutively at the end of the list `a`. `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive appearances of `tmp` found in the list `a` before the last sequence.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `_` remains a placeholder.
- The variable `n` is the number of elements in the list `a`, and it is greater than 0.
- The variable `a` is the list of integers input by the user.
- The variable `tmp` is still equal to the first integer in the list `a`.
- The variable `i` is `n-1`, meaning the loop has completed all iterations.
- The variable `cnt` is the count of how many times the integer `tmp` appears consecutively at the end of the list `a`.
- The variable `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive appearances of `tmp` found in the list `a` before the last sequence. If `tmp` does not appear consecutively at all, `ans` will be 0.
