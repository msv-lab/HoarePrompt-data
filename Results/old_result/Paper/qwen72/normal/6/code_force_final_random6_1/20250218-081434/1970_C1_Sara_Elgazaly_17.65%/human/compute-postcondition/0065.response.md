Postcondition: ***`lst[x]` is a non-empty list with its last element removed, `y` is the last element that was removed from `lst[x]`, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged, `s` is `not s`. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, `x` is now equal to `y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
