Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`, `r` is `r + 1` and must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again, `sm` is `sm - 1`. The frequency of `a[r]` in `ca` is incremented by 1. If `ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]` was true before the execution, it may no longer be true after the execution.**
