The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. `r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of integers, and `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing the range of an operation. The function modifies the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` by filling it with the value `n`, where `n` is equal to `l - r + 1`. It also ensures that the minimum value in the modified sublist is `n`. Additionally, the list `ops` is updated to include the new inner list `[r + 1, l + 1]`. The function returns the modified list `lst`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`, where `r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of integers, and `ops` is a list of operation ranges. It fills the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` with the value `n` (where `n` is `l - r + 1`), ensures the minimum value in this sublist is `n`, and appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list. The function returns the modified `lst`.**
