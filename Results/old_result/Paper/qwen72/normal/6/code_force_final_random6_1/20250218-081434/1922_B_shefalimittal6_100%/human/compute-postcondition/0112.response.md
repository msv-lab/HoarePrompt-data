Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `idx` is `n + n + n + 4`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and an additional string representation of `ans`, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `v[x]` incremented by `n`, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Since `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, the new value of `ans` is a positive integer.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `ans` is 0.
- The value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3.
- The expression `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` calculates the number of combinations of `v[i]` taken 3 at a time, which is a positive integer.
- Therefore, `ans` is updated to a positive integer value, specifically `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
