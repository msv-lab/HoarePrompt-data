The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `adv`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` being less than `adv`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `adv` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2, and `adv` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, sorted in descending order and must have at least 1 element, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `cnt` is equal to `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2**
