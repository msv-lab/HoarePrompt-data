Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program contains a logical error in the condition `if a + b & 1 == 0:`. The bitwise AND operator `&` has higher precedence than the addition operator `+`, so the expression `a + b & 1` is evaluated as `a + (b & 1)`. This is incorrect because the intended logic is to check if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd, which should be written as `(a + b) & 1 == 0`.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:
- Input: `a = 1`, `b = 4`
- Expected Output: "Alice"
- Actual Output: "Bob"

In this case, `a + b` is `5`, which is odd. However, the expression `1 + 4 & 1` evaluates to `1 + 0` (since `4 & 1` is `0`), which is `1`. The program incorrectly interprets this as an even number and outputs "Bob" instead of "Alice".

The correct condition should be:
```python
if (a + b) & 1 == 0:
```

This ensures that the sum of `a` and `b` is correctly evaluated for evenness.
