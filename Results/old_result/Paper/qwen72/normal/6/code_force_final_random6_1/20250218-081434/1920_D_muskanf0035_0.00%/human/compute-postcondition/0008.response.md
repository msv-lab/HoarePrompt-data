Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains two integers, `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 5000.
- The code snippet `n, q = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `n` and `q` respectively.
- After this assignment, `n` and `q` are now specific positive integers provided by the user, still within the range 1 to 10^5.
- The other variables (`operations`, `queries`, `result`, and `_`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
