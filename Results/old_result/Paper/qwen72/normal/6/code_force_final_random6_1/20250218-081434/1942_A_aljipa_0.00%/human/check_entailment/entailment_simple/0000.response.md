Reasoning:

The program attempts to solve the problem by considering two special cases for the values of `k`:

1. **When `k == n`**: It creates an array of `n` elements, all set to 1. This is correct because an array with all elements equal will have all cyclic shifts sorted, which matches the requirement that exactly `n` cyclic shifts are sorted.

2. **When `k == 1`**: It creates an array of `n` elements using the `range(n)` function, which generates a sequence from 0 to `n-1`. This is correct because an array with elements in strictly increasing order will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the array itself. All other cyclic shifts will have the last element (which is the largest) moved to the front, making the array unsorted.

However, the program does not handle the case where `1 < k < n`. In this case, the program should output `-1` because it is impossible to have an array with exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts where `1 < k < n`. The program incorrectly outputs `[-1]` for all cases where `k` is not 1 or `n`, which is a list with a single element `-1`. The output should be just `-1` (not a list).

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `1 < k < n` properly and outputs a list instead of a single integer `-1`.

Correctness: **False**
