The values of `n` and `m` are assigned based on the input provided, where `input().split()` splits the input string into two parts, and `map(int, ...)` converts these parts into integers. The values of `x` and `y` remain distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x â‰  y. The value of `i` remains 0. The input values for `n` and `m` must be greater than 0.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x â‰  y, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0.**
