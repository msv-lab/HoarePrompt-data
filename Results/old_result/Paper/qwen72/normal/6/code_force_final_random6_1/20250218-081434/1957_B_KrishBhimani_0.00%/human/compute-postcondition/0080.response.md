The code `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends the value `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. 

- `ans` initially contains the value `1 << i` if `c` is not equal to `n - 1`, or it contains the values `k0` and `1 << i` if `c` was initially equal to `n - 1`.
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`.
- `i` is the second element in `arr`.
- `c` is 1.

Let's break down the possible scenarios:

1. **If `c` was initially not equal to `n - 1`:**
   - `ans` contains the value `1 << i`.
   - The new value appended to `ans` is `k0 - (1 << i)`.

2. **If `c` was initially equal to `n - 1`:**
   - `ans` contains the values `k0` and `1 << i`.
   - The new value appended to `ans` is `k0 - (k0 + (1 << i))`, which simplifies to `- (1 << i)`.

The other variables (`t`, `_`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, `arr`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the second element in `arr`, `arr` must have at least two elements, `ans` is a list containing `1 << i` and `k0 - (1 << i)` if `c` is not equal to `n - 1`, or `ans` contains `k0`, `1 << i`, and `- (1 << i)` if `c` was initially equal to `n - 1`, and `c` is 1.**
