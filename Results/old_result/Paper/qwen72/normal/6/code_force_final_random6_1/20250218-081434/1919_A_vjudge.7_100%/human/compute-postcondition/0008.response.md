The only objects in the loop head are the variables `t` and `test`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is less than `test`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 0 and `test` is an integer such that 1 <= test <= 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be incremented by 1 to 1, and `test` must still be an integer such that 1 <= test <= 1000, but now `t` must be less than `test`.

State: **`func` is expected to take two parameters `a` and `b`, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `test` must be an integer such that 1 <= test <= 1000, `t` is 1, and `a` and `b` are input integers. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the program executes the if part. If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the program executes the else part.**
