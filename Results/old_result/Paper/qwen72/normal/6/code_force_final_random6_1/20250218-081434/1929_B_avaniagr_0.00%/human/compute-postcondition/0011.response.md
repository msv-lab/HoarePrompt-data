Functionality: ** The function reads lines from the standard input, processes each line to extract two integers `n` and `k`, and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to ensure that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell. After processing all lines, the function completes, and the final state is that the input has been fully read and the results have been printed for each line. The function does not return any value. **
