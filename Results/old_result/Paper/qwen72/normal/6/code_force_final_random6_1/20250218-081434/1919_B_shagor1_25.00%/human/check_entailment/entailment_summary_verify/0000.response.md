### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not handle the problem as described. Let's break down the issues and the expected behavior:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to split the array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The optimal way to split the array is crucial to achieving the minimum penalty.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It counts the number of '-' characters in `s` and stores it in `neg`.
   - It then prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function does not perform any splitting of the array `a`.
   - It calculates a penalty based on a simple formula involving the count of '-' characters and the length of the string.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `1\n4\n++--`, the program calculates `n = 4` and `neg = 2`.
   - The penalty is calculated as `4 - 2 * 2 = 0`.
   - However, the optimal way to split `++--` is `([1, 1], [-1, -1])`, which results in a penalty of `p([1, 1]) + p([-1, -1]) = 2 * 2 + 2 * 2 = 4 + 4 = 8`.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To minimize the penalty, the array should be split in such a way that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.
   - If the sum of the entire array is zero, the optimal split is to keep it as one subarray, resulting in a penalty of zero.
   - If the sum is not zero, the optimal split involves breaking the array into subarrays that balance the sum as much as possible.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not implement the optimal splitting logic.
   - It uses a simple formula that does not consider the actual sum of the subarrays, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the optimal splitting logic required to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement. The original assessment accurately identifies this issue.
