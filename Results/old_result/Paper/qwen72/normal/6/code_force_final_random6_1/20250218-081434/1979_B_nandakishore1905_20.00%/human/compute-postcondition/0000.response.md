The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function, and this is the state it will have at the start of the loop. The conditions for `x` and `y` do not directly affect the loop's execution and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x â‰  y, `i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
