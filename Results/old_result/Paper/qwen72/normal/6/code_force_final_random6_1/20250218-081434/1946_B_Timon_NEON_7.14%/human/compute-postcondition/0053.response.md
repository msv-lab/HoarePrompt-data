Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum found during the loop, and `segments_variants` is a list of all segments that were considered but not chosen as the `max_segment`. `new_segment` is an empty list if the last element of `arr` is less than 0, otherwise it is a list containing the sum of the last segment and the index of the last element in that segment.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- `arr` remains the same list of integers it was initially.
- `i` is the index of the last element in `arr`, which is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `max_sum` remains -1, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum found during the loop, and it contains the sum of the segment and the starting index of that segment.
- `segments_variants` is a list of all segments that were considered but not chosen as the `max_segment`. Each element in this list is a list containing the sum of the segment, the starting index, and the ending index.
- `new_segment` is an empty list if the last element of `arr` is less than 0. Otherwise, it is a list containing the sum of the last segment and the index of the last element in that segment.
