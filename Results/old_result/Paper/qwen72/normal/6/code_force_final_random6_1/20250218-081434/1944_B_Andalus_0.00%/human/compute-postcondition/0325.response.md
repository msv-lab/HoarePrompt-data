Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `rdb` is a list that must have at least one element.
- `elem` is the first element in `rdb`.
- `sz` is a variable that is compared to `k`.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- The current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
- `elem` is the first element in the list `rdb`.

### Output:
Since `elem` is the first element in the list `rdb`, and the `print` statement will print it twice followed by a space, the output will be:

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the first element of the list `rdb`)**
