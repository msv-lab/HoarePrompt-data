### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array elements `a` from the input.

2. **Array Validation**:
   - The program uses a list comprehension to convert the input string into a list of integers `a`.
   - It then checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the function `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through the array `a` and counts the number of times an element is greater than or equal to the next element.
   - If the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
   - This function is correctly implemented to check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - If the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, the program prints `0` because the beauty of a sorted array in non-decreasing order is zero.
   - If the array is not sorted, the program sorts the array `a` in non-decreasing order and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.
   - However, the problem requires maximizing the beauty, which is achieved by sorting the array in non-increasing order, not non-decreasing order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements are maximized when the largest elements are placed first and the smallest elements are placed last.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case, but the beauty is calculated incorrectly due to the sorting in non-decreasing order.

### Conclusion:
- The program is incorrect because it sorts the array in non-decreasing order, which minimizes the beauty, instead of sorting it in non-increasing order to maximize the beauty.

### Correctness:
Final: **False**
