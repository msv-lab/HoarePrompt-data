### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's carefully analyze the problem and the logic implemented in the code.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Alice and Bob each have a certain number of coins in their wallets, represented by `a` and `b` respectively.
   - Alice makes the first move.
   - Each player can either swap wallets with the other or keep their current wallet.
   - After choosing, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., their wallet is empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Play:**
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.
   - The key to solving this problem is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins `a + b`.

3. **Parity Analysis:**
   - If the total number of coins `a + b` is even, Bob will always win.
   - If the total number of coins `a + b` is odd, Alice will always win.

#### Explanation:
- **Even Total Coins:**
  - If `a + b` is even, the game will always end in an even number of moves.
  - Since Alice makes the first move, Bob will make the last move.
  - Bob will always be able to make a move after Alice, and eventually, Bob will be the one to make the final move when both wallets are empty.

- **Odd Total Coins:**
  - If `a + b` is odd, the game will always end in an odd number of moves.
  - Since Alice makes the first move, Alice will make the last move.
  - Alice will always be able to make a move after Bob, and eventually, Alice will be the one to make the final move when both wallets are empty.

#### Code Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b`.
- It then checks the parity of `a + b` using the bitwise AND operator `&`.
  - The expression `a + b & 1 == 0` is intended to check if `a + b` is even.
  - However, the expression is incorrect due to operator precedence. The `+` operator has higher precedence than the `&` operator, so the expression is evaluated as `(a + (b & 1)) == 0`, which is not the intended logic.

#### Correct Expression:
- To correctly check the parity of `a + b`, the expression should be `(a + b) & 1 == 0`.

#### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

#### Correctness:
- The original logic implemented in the code is correct in terms of the parity analysis.
- However, the expression used to check the parity is incorrect due to operator precedence.
- The corrected code will correctly determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.
- The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The given Python program is incorrect due to the incorrect expression used to check the parity of `a + b`. The corrected code will be correct.

Final: **False**
