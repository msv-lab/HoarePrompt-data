The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` is 0, this element is removed. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `res`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed and its last element is now undefined (as the last element has been removed), `res` is 0.
Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed and its last element is now undefined, `res` is 0**
