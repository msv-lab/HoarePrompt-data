The provided code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement itself. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not influenced by the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from a new input string.
   - `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from a new input string.
   - `_` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` must be greater than `_`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('Yes')
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'Yes'`.
   - The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `_` are not referenced in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Output: **Yes**
