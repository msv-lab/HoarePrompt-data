Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`.**

Explanation: The value of `a[0]` is decremented by `mi`, which is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
