Postcondition: ***`rdb` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. In all cases, the current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0.***
