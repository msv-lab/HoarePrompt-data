The only variables in the loop head are `steps` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `steps` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, and `steps` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `steps` will be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than 1 (since `steps` is now 1).

State: **`t` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, `steps` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are input integers, `n` is equal to \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\), `x` is equal to \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\). If `x` > `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.**
