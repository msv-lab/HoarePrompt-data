Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, and `x` is 0. If the element at index `x` in the list `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is set to `l[0]` and `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `a` is set to the integer at index `x` in the list `l`, `b` remains `float('inf')`, and `c` is set to 1.***
