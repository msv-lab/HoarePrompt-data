Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 1, `result` is a list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is an even integer or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is an odd integer, and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.**

The code snippet `total_space = space_y + space_x` has been executed, and `total_space` is now equal to the sum of `space_y` and `space_x`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
