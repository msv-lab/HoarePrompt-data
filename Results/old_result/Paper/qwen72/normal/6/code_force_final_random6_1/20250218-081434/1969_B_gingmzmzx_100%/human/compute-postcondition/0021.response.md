Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string with at least three elements, `c` is the third element of `s`. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [3, 0], and `ans` is `zeroes - 1`. Otherwise, `cnt` is [0, 3], and `ans` is `2 * (zeroes - 1) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains unchanged.
- If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [3, 0], so `cnt[1]` is 0, and `ans` remains `zeroes - 2`.
- If `c` is not 0, `cnt` is [0, 3], so `cnt[1]` is 3, and `ans` is incremented by 1, making it `2 * (zeroes - 1) - 1`.
- The values of `n`, `s`, and `c` remain unchanged.
