The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` function is called with the string `'1'` as its first argument.
- The `end` parameter is set to `' '`, which means that after printing `'1'`, the print function will not move to a new line but will instead append a space character.

### Variables and Objects:
- The variables `t`, `n`, and `i` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement only prints the string `'1'` and appends a space character.

### Output:
The code will print the string `'1'` followed by a space character.
Output: **1 **
