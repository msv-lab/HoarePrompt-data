The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `r` was initially `n - 3`, after the decrement, `r` is now `n - 4`. The conditions regarding `a[l-1]` being equal to `a[l]` for all `l` from 0 to the final value of `l-1`, `a[r]` being equal to `a[r - 1]`, and `l` being the smallest index such that `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l+1]` or `l` is equal to `r` still hold, but with the updated value of `r`. The values of `st`, `end`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and `a[l-1]` must be equal to `a[l]` for all `l` from 0 to the final value of `l-1`, `l` is the smallest index such that `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l+1]` or `l` is equal to `r` and `l` must be less than `r`, `r` is `n - 4` and `r` must be greater than or equal to `l`, `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is the final value of `l`, `end` is 2, `ans` is 0**
