The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
