The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `d`, which is a non-negative integer. It prints a query string in the format "? d" to the console and flushes the output buffer to ensure immediate printing. The function then reads a line of input from the user, expects it to contain two integers separated by a space, and returns these two integers as a tuple `(v, u)`. The function does not modify the input parameter `d` or any other external state.
