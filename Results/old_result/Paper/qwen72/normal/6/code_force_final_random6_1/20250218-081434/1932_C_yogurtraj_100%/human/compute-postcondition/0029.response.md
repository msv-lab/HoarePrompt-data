Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of times 'L' appears in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where the last element is `k` (which is `a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `a[l] % m`), `q1` is `l - 3` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and the character at index `i` in `t` is not 'R', otherwise `l - 2`, `q2` is `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and the character at index `i` in `t` is not 'R', otherwise `l + 2`, `i` is `n - 3`, `y[n - 2]` is `k`, and `k` is now `k * a[q2] % m`.**
