The only variable in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `remaining_vertices` is non-empty. At the end of the last iteration, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any). For the loop to execute one more time, `remaining_vertices` must still be non-empty.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is -1, `path` contains at most one vertex (if a suitable `v` was found and added), `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any) and must be non-empty**
