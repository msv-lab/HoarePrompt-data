Output State: **`t` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the first input string, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(b)` converts `b` to an integer, but since `b` was already an integer value (from the initial state), this operation does not change its value. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain valid and unchanged.
