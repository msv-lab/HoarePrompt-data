Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 0, `k` and `a` are integers provided by the user, `s` is now `1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1 + (1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1`, `x` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `s` is `1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1`.
- The code `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is executed, which updates `s` by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value.
- The new value of `s` is `1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1 + (1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `k`, `a`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.
