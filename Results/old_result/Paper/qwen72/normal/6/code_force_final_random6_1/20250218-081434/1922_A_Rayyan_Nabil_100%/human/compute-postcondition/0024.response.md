To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `results` is a list containing `t` results, where each result is the output of the function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration.
   - `result` is the second element of the `results` list.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(result)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `results` list contains `t` elements, each of which is the result of calling `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for some values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - The `result` variable is assigned the value of the second element in the `results` list, which is `results[1]`.
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the value of `results[1]`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `results[1]`. However, we know that `results[1]` is the output of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for some specific values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` during the second iteration.

Output: **results[1] (where results[1] is the output of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for the second iteration)**
