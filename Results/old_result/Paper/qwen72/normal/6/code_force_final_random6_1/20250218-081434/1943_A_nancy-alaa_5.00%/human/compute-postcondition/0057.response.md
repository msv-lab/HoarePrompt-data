Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
- Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `n` or `i`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state.
- The condition `if i is not in mpp.keys()` is mentioned, but it does not affect the value of `i` or `n` directly. It only determines whether the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
- Since the code snippet only contains a `print(i)` statement, and `i` is set to 1, the value of `i` will be printed.

### Output:
Output: **1**
