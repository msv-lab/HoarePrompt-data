Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list with the first element being `lit[0]`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`, which is now `lit[0]`. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b.append(lit[i])` adds the first element of `lit` to the list `b`.
- `b` was initially an empty list, so after the execution, `b` contains the first element of `lit`.
- The value of `y` is now the last element of `b`, which is `lit[0]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, and the conditions for `s` and `x` remain unchanged.
