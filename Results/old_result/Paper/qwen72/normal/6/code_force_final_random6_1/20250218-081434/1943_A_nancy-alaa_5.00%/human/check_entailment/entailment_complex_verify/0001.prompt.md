You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n). The total number of test cases t is provided, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        first = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
        
    #State: After all iterations, `n` remains unchanged for each test case, `i` is `n-1` for the last iteration of each test case, and `first` is True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that occurs exactly once and is less than `n` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function prints the smallest integer `i` (0 ≤ i < n) that is either missing from the list or occurs exactly once and is the first such integer encountered. If no such integer exists, the function does not print anything for that test case. The state of the program after the function concludes remains unchanged for each test case, with `n` and `arr` being the same as they were at the start of the test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of the array `c`.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX.
   - If an element appears only once in `a`, Alice will pick it on her first turn to ensure it is in `c`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It iterates through the range `0` to `n-1` to find the smallest element that is not in `c` or appears only once in `a` and is picked by Alice.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
     - `first` is a boolean flag to track if Alice has picked an element that appears only once.
   - **Iteration:**
     - The program iterates through the range `0` to `n-1`.
     - If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it means `i` is not in `arr`, and thus the MEX is `i`.
     - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and appears only once, and `first` is `True`, it means Alice has already picked an element that appears only once, so Bob will pick `i` and the MEX is `i`.
     - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and appears only once, and `first` is `False`, it means Alice will pick `i` on her first turn, and `first` is set to `True`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all elements from `0` to `n-1` are in `arr` and each appears more than once, the MEX will be `n`.
   - If there is an element that appears only once, Alice will pick it on her first turn, and Bob will try to prevent the MEX from being higher.

6. **Correctness:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest element that is not in `c` or appears only once in `a` and is picked by Alice.
   - The logic ensures that the MEX is calculated based on the optimal play of both players.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the optimal strategy for both players.

**Correctness: True**
