def func_1():

    #The program returns a string that is the input provided by the user, with any trailing newline characters removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the standard input (usually the keyboard), removes any trailing newline characters, and returns the resulting string. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that a string, representing the user's input with trailing newline characters removed, is returned.

def func_2():

    #The program returns an integer value that is the result of calling `func_1()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It returns an integer value that is the result of calling `func_1()`. The final state of the program after `func_2` concludes is that it has an integer value derived from the output of `func_1()`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_1()` and converting each part to an integer.

If `c` is '1', `ans` contains all unique values of `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`. If `0` is in the original `ans`, `0` is removed from `ans` and `n` is added to `ans`. `m` is 0, `r` and `c` remain unchanged.

    #This is printed: len(ans) (where `ans` is the set resulting from the operations described in the initial state)

    #This is printed: sorted(ans) (where `ans` is the set of unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?', or unique values of `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1', with `0` removed and `n` added if `0` is in the original `ans`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts no parameters directly but relies on the output of `func_3` to obtain three integers `n`, `m`, and `x` where `2 <= n <= 1000`, `1 <= m <= 1000`, and `1 <= x <= n`. It then performs a series of operations based on the values of `r` and `c` obtained from `func_1` for `m` iterations. The final state of the program is that `ans` is a set of unique integers derived from the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?', or just `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1'. If `0` is present in `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added to the set. The function prints the length of `ans` and the sorted elements of `ans`. The function does not return any value.
