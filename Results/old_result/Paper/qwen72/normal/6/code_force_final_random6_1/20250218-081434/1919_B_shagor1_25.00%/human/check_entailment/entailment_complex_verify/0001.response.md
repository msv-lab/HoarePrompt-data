### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a while loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Counting Negatives:**
   - The program counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores this count in the variable `neg`.

3. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - The penalty calculation is based on the formula `print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)`.
   - This formula is derived from the observation that the optimal way to minimize the penalty is to split the array such that the sum of each subarray is zero whenever possible.
   - If the number of '+' and '-' characters is not equal (i.e., `n != neg`), the penalty is calculated as `n - 2 * neg`. This is because each '-' character contributes -1 to the sum, and each '+' character contributes 1. The optimal split would balance the number of '+' and '-' characters as much as possible.
   - If the number of '+' and '-' characters is equal (i.e., `n == neg`), the penalty is simply `n` because the sum of the entire array is zero, and the penalty is the length of the array.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the string `s` is entirely composed of '+' or '-' characters correctly.
   - For a string with equal numbers of '+' and '-' characters, the penalty is zero, which is correctly handled by the formula.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotation suggests that the function `func_1` should be defined with parameters `t` and `test_cases`. However, this is not necessary for the given problem, as the function is designed to handle each test case independently by reading input directly.
   - The state of the program right before the function call is correctly described: `func_1` is called in a loop, and it reads `n` and `s` for each test case.
   - The state of the program within `func_1` is also correctly described: `n` is the length of the string `s`, `s` is the input string, and `neg` is the count of '-' characters in `s`.
   - The final print statement is correctly described: it prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for calculating the minimum possible penalty based on the given problem description. It handles all the edge cases and follows the correct approach to minimize the penalty. The annotations do not challenge the correctness of the program; they merely suggest a different way of handling test cases, which is not required for the given problem.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
