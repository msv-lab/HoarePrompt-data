Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 100, `steps` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are the last set of input integers for the final iteration, `n` is equal to \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\), and `x` is equal to \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\). If `x` > `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The number of test cases, `t`, remains the same and is an integer between 3 and 100.
- The loop variable `steps` has reached the value `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are the coordinates from the last test case.
- The variables `n` and `x` are calculated based on the coordinates of the last test case, with `n` being the squared distance between the points `(a, b)` and `(e, f)`, and `x` being the squared distance between the points `(c, d)` and `(g, h)`.
- The loop will have printed the smaller of the two values `n` and `x` for each test case.
