Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `start` and `end` are integers such that \(0 \leq \text{start} \leq \text{end}\).
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer, and `n` is not equal to 2.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`.
   - `count_1` is even.
   - The string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement is a simple `print('NO')`.
   - The string 'NO' is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.
   - Therefore, the output will always be 'NO' regardless of the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, or `count_1`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The print statement will output the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
