The variable in the loop head is `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be non-zero. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` divided by 2 (using integer division). If `k` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. Since `k` is already non-zero (as it must be for the loop to have executed at least once), no adjustment is needed for `k` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` divided by 2 (using integer division), `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements being zeros. If the original `k` (now `k0`) was an odd number, `arr` contains `[0]`. Otherwise, `arr` remains an empty list.**
