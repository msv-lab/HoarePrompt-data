Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and must have at least 1 element, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space, `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, where `q` is the first element of `ans`.** 

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` already contains `(q + r) % n` (as per the initial state), it now contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
