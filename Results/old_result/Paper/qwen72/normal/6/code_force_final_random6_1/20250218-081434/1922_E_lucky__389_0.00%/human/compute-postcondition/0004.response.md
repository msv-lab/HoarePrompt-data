To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `x != 0`. The state right before the loop indicates that `x` is an input integer and is now `x - 1`. This means that `x` has already been decremented by 1. For the loop to execute, `x` must not be 0 after this decrement. 

Given that the input `X` is a positive integer (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), and `x` is now `X - 1`, `x` will be at least 1 (since the minimum value of `X` is 2, and 2 - 1 = 1). Therefore, `x` is guaranteed to be non-zero, and the loop will execute at least once.

No adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`x` is an input integer and `x` is now `x - 1` (which is at least 1), `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0**
