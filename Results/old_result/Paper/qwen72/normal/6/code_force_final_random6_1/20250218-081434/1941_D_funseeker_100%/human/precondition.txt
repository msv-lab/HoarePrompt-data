The function `read` is intended to read input data, which includes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, the starting player `x`, and a list of `m` throws, where each throw is represented by a distance `r_i` and a direction `c_i` ('0', '1', or '?'). The input is structured such that the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, the first line contains `n`, `m`, and `x` (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ x ≤ n), followed by `m` lines, each containing `r_i` (1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1) and `c_i`. The sum of `n * m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
