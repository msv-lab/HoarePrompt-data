Output State: **_ is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations plus `k // n`, `k` is not 0, and `res` is the final value after all iterations.**

The value of `ans` is updated by adding the integer division result of `k` divided by `n` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged.
