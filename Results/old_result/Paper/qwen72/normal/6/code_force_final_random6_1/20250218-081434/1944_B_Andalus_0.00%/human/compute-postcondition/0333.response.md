Postcondition: ***`rdb` must have at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in `rdb`, and `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` after the increase, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged.***
