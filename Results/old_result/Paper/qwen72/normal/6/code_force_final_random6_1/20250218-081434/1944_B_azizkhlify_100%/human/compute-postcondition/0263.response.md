Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - The element at the index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is printing the element at index `i` of the list `a`.
   - From the initial state, we know that `i` is 0.
   - Therefore, the code will print the element at index 0 of the list `a`.

4. **Output:**
   - The element at index 0 of the list `a` is printed.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

Since the exact value of `a[0]` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe it in terms of the given information.

Output: **a[0] (where a[0] is the first element of the list a)**
