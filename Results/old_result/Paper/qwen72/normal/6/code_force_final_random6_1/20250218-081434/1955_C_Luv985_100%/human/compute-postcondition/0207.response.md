The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n`: an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5
- `k`: an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15
- `a`: a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept these parameters and return a result based on them.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t`, an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a result based on these parameters.**
