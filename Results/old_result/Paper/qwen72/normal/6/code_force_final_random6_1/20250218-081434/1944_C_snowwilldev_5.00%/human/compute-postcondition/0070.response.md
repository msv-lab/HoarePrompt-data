To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `i` and `N`.

- `i` is currently set to `N-1`.
- `N` is an input integer greater than 1.

For the loop to execute, `i` must start from 0 and `N` must be greater than 0. The current state of `i` being `N-1` is not appropriate for the loop to start executing from the beginning. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to 0.

The other variables (`tc`, `a`, `t`, and `cnt`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`tc` is 2 or 3, `N` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 0, `t` is the number of unique elements in `a` that appeared exactly once in the list `a` from index 0 to `N-1` up to the point where `t` reached 2 or a non-unique element was found, and `cnt` is a defaultdict with default type int, initialized to an empty state.**
