Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is 0, `ans_list` contains the value of `a[0]`, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`, `k` is 0, `ans` remains `a[0]`, `res` remains `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
