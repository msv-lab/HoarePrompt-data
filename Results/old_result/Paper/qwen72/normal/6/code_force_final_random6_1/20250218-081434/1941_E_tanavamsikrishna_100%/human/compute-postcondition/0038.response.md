Output State: **`min_heap` is a valid min-heap with at least one tuple `(value, index)` where `index <= 0`, `i` is `d + 2`, `row[i]` has been updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, `row` must have at least `d + 2` elements**

The `pass` statement does not change any variables or state. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged.
