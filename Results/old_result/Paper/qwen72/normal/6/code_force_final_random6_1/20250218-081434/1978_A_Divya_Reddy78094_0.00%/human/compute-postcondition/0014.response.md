Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.** 

The code snippet `nums.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `nums` in descending order. The other variables (`t`, `_`, and `n`) are not affected by this code, so their initial states remain unchanged.
