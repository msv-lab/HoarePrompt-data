Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by first checking if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements. This part of the logic is correct.

However, the program's approach to finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is flawed. Specifically, the program only calculates the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the first element in the array (`arr[0]`). This is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, as it does not consider other elements or the overall structure of the array.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Identify all possible sequences where the middle element can be replaced.
2. Determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break these sequences.

A correct approach would involve:
- Checking if the array is already non-beautiful by default.
- If the array is beautiful, finding the minimum number of elements to remove to break the condition where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}` for any `i` in the range `[2, n-1]`.

The current program does not perform these steps correctly, and thus it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
