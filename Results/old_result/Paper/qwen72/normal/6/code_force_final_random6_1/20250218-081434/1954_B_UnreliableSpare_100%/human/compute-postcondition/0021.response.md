Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise `flag` is False, `ans` is Decimal('Infinity'), `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`.**

The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
