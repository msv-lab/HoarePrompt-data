The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, as specified in the problem statement. The variable `i` will start at 1 and increment up to `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 49.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
- `n` is now the integer value provided by the user for the current test case.

To ensure the loop executes, the state must be adjusted to:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is 1**
