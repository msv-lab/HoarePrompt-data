Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15) and is now `k - 2 * a[l]`, `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `l` is 0, `r` is now `n - 2`, `sunks` is 1, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]`. The current value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the current value of `a[r]`, and `k` is greater than or equal to twice the current value of `a[l]`. Additionally, the current value of `a[r]` is 0.**
