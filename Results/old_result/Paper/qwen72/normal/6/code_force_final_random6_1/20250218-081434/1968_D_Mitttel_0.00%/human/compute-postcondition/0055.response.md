Output State: **`cycle_length` must be greater than 0, `cycle_score` is increased by the sum of the values of `a` at the positions visited during the entire cycle, `cycle_pos` is now equal to the position it was at the start of the cycle, `remaining_steps` is equal to `k - steps`, `full_cycles` is equal to `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remainder_steps` is equal to `remaining_steps % cycle_length`, `score` is increased by `full_cycles * cycle_score`.**
