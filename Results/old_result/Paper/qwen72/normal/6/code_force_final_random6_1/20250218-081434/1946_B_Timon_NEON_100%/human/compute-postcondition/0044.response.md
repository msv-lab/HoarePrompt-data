Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 3 elements. `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], and `segments_variants` is either an empty list or [[arr[0] + arr[1], 0, 1]].**

Explanation:
- `arr` remains a list of integers with the same constraints.
- `i` remains 2.
- `max_sum` remains -1.
- `new_segment` is now an empty list.
- `max_segment` is still [arr[0] + arr[1], 0] because the initial conditions specify that if `new_segment` is non-empty and `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0].
- `segments_variants` could be an empty list or [[arr[0] + arr[1], 0, 1]], depending on the initial conditions. If `arr[1]` is negative, `segments_variants` is an empty list. If `arr[1]` is non-negative, `segments_variants` is [[arr[0] + arr[1], 0, 1]].
