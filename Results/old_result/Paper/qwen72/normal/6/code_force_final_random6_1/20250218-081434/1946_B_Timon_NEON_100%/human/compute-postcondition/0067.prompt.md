Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr). `i` is len(arr) - 1. `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum encountered during the loop, and it contains the sum of the segment and the starting index of the segment. `new_segment` is either an empty list or the segment that is currently being built, containing the sum of the segment and the starting index of the segment. `segments_variants` is a list of segments that were considered as potential max segments but were discarded because a higher sum segment was found. The last element of `segments_variants` is now `new_segment` appended with the value `len(arr) - 1`. `max_sum` remains -1. `total_max_segment` is [-1].
Code of the loop:
for segment in segments_variants:
    if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1:
        total_max_segment = segment


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr)`, `i` is len(arr) - 1, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum encountered during the loop, and it contains the sum of the segment and the starting index of the segment, `new_segment` is either an empty list or the segment that is currently being built, containing the sum of the segment and the starting index of the segment, `segments_variants` is a list of segments that were considered as potential max segments but were discarded because a higher sum segment was found, and it must contain at least one element, `max_sum` remains -1, if the sum of `segment` is greater than the sum of the previous `total_max_segment` and `segment` has more than one element, then `total_max_segment` is updated to `segment`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr)`, `i` is len(arr) - 1, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum encountered during the loop, and it contains the sum of the segment and the starting index of the segment, `new_segment` is either an empty list or the segment that is currently being built, containing the sum of the segment and the starting index of the segment, `segments_variants` is a list of segments that were considered as potential max segments but were discarded because a higher sum segment was found, and it must contain at least one element, `segment` is the next element in `segments_variants`. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]` and the length of `segment` is not 1, then `total_max_segment` is updated to be equal to `segment`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr)`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum encountered during the loop, `new_segment` is either an empty list or the segment that is currently being built, `segments_variants` is a list of segments that were considered as potential max segments but were discarded because a higher sum segment was found, and it must contain at least two elements. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]` and `len(segment)` is not 1, then `total_max_segment` is updated to be the second element in `segments_variants`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
