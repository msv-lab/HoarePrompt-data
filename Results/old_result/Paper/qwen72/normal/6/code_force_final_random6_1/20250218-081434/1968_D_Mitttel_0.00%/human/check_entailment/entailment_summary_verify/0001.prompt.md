You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    bodya_score = calculate_score(PB)

    if bodya_score > sasha_score:
        return 'Bodya'
    elif sasha_score > bodya_score:
        return 'Sasha'

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract multiple sets of parameters, and calls `func_1` for each set. It then prints the results of each call to `func_1`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, `input` remains a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `index` is reset to 0, and `results` is a list containing the values returned by `func_1` for each set of parameters.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes this list to extract the necessary values for each test case. This approach is efficient for large inputs and avoids the overhead of reading input multiple times.

2. **Test Case Loop**:
   - For each test case, `func_2` extracts the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` from the input data. It then calls `func_1` with these values to determine the winner of the game.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The function `calculate_score` is responsible for calculating the score for a given starting position. It uses a dictionary `visited` to track the positions visited and the number of steps taken to reach each position.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., the current position has been visited before), the function calculates the length of the cycle and the total score within the cycle. It then uses this information to efficiently compute the score for the remaining steps by adding the score of full cycles and the score of the remaining steps within the cycle.

4. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The cycle detection is done using a dictionary `visited` to store the step at which each position is visited. If a position is visited again, a cycle is detected, and the cycle start is identified.
   - The cycle length and cycle score are calculated, and the remaining steps are processed to add the appropriate score.

5. **Final Score Comparison**:
   - The function `func_1` calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha to get their final scores. It then compares these scores to determine the winner and returns the appropriate result.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
- The `calculate_score` function efficiently detects cycles and calculates the score for the remaining steps, ensuring that the score is computed correctly even for large values of `k`.
- The comparison of scores in `func_1` is straightforward and correct.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem description.

### Correctness: **True**
