Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is equal to `a - t1`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1`.***
