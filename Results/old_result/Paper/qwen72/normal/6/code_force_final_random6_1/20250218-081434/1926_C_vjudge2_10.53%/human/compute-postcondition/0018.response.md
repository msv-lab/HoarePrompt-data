Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 0, `i` is 0, `sum_values[0]` is 0, `sum_values[0]` is assigned the value of `total` which is 0.**

In natural language: The initial state remains the same, but the value at index 0 of the `sum_values` list is now 0, which is the same as the value of `total`.
