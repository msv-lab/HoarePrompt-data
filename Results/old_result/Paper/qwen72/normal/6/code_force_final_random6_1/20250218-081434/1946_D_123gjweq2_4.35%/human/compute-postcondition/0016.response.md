Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list that contains the first element of `cur_arr` if the bit at position `bit` in the first element of `cur_arr` is 0, otherwise `new_arr` remains an empty list, `xor` is 0 if the bit at position `bit` in the first element of `cur_arr` is 0, otherwise `xor` retains its original value, and `thing1` is 0.***
