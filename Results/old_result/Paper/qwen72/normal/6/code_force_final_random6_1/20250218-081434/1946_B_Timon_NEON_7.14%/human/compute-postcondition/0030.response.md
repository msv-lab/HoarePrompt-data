Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` remains [arr[0], 0] if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `max_segment` is an empty list, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [0] if `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `new_segment[0]`, otherwise it is [0, 0, -1].**
