Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains two integers provided by the user, `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration and must be less than `t` for the loop to continue, the loop has executed `t` times, and all results have been printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations:
- The initial value of `t` remains the same, and it is an integer between 1 and 5000.
- For each iteration, `n` and `q` are positive integers provided by the user, each within the range of 1 to 10^5.
- `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains two integers provided by the user.
- `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user.
- `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)` for each iteration.
- The loop variable `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, and the loop continues until `_` is no longer less than `t`.
- After all iterations, the results of `func_1` for each set of inputs have been printed.
