Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` is flawed when it comes to arrays where the elements at the ends are not the same but there are multiple occurrences of the same element within the array. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`. The correct minimum cost to make all elements equal should be 4 (by setting the elements from index 1 to 5 to 3), but the provided program will return 5, which is incorrect.

Let's break down the issue:
- The program starts by checking if the elements at the ends of the array are the same. If they are, it moves inward.
- If the elements at the ends are different, it breaks out of the loop and calculates the cost as `j - i + 1`.
- However, it does not correctly handle cases where the same element appears multiple times within the array, and the optimal solution might involve setting a larger segment to that element.

This is a clear case where the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
