Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet).
   - `i` is 0 (though `i` is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` and `k` are input integers.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` is a string containing the first 26 letters of the English alphabet.
   - `[:k]` is a slice operation that takes the first `k` characters from the string.
   - `* n` repeats the resulting string `n` times.
   - The `print` statement will output the repeated string.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` is sliced to get the first `k` characters.
   - This sliced string is then repeated `n` times.
   - The final output will be the concatenated result of repeating the first `k` characters of the alphabet `n` times.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since `k` and `n` are input integers, the exact output will depend on their values.
   - However, we can describe the output in terms of `k` and `n`.

Output: **The first `k` characters of the alphabet repeated `n` times** (where `k` is the number of characters to slice from the alphabet string and `n` is the number of times to repeat the sliced string).
