Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 18`, `i` is 2, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1) ** 2`. If `sm` > `over_sum` at any iteration, `over_sum` is updated to the maximum value of `sm` found, and `r` and `l` are set to the corresponding `i` and `j` values. Otherwise, `over_sum` remains unchanged and `r` and `l` retain their last updated values.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The list `lst` remains unchanged.
- The variable `i` is still 2.
- The variable `j` is now `len(lst) - 1`, which is the last index of the list.
- The variable `sm` is calculated as the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst`, plus the sum of the elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst` (which will be 0 if `j` is the last index), plus the square of the number of elements between `i` and `j` inclusive.
- The variable `over_sum` is updated to the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop, and the variables `r` and `l` are set to the corresponding `i` and `j` values where this maximum `sm` was found. If no `sm` value was greater than the initial `over_sum`, `over_sum` remains unchanged, and `r` and `l` retain their last updated values.
