Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input provided by the user, `n` is the first integer in `L`, `m` is the minimum of the second integer in `L` and the third integer in `L`, `k` is the third integer in `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`, `cost` is either `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m` is equal to `k`, or `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu` if `n * m` is not equal to `k`, where `w` is the last element of the original `N` and `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `q` is updated to the ceiling of `k / m`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `N`, `cost`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `q` is used in the definition of `N` and `cost`, but these variables are not recalculated in the given code snippet.
