Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a` but all values in `counter` are now 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` and additional elements such that the total length of `ans` is `n + cnt`, and the last `cnt` elements of `ans` are each one less than the previous element, starting from the last element of the initial `ans` list.**

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- The `counter` object remains unchanged, with all values still being 0.
- The variable `cnt` is now 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The list `ans` has been extended by `cnt` elements, each of which is one less than the previous element, starting from the last element of the initial `ans` list. The total length of `ans` is now `n + cnt`.
