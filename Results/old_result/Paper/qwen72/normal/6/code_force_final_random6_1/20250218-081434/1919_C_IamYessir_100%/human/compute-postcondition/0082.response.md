Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are lists that may have been modified based on the conditions in the loop body. If `y` (the last element of `b` or infinity if `b` is empty) is greater than or equal to `lit[2]`, then `y` is updated to `lit[2]` (if `b` is not empty). If `lit[2]` is greater than `x` (the last element of `a` or infinity if `a` is empty), then `y` is updated to `lit[2]` (if `b` is not empty). If `lit[2]` is greater than `y` (the last element of `b` or infinity if `b` is empty) but not greater than `x`, then `lit[2]` is appended to `a`. If neither condition is met, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
