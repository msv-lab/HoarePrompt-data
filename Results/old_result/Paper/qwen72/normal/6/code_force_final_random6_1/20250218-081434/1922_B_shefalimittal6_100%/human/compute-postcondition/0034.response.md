Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`, `i` is 1, `ans` is `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated by adding the value of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.
- `v[i]` is 0 because `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros and `i` is 1.
- `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`, which means `cnt` is `cnt + 0` or simply `cnt`.
- Therefore, `ans` is updated by adding `cnt * 0 * (0 - 1) // 2`, which is `0`.
- The value of `ans` remains `0` after the execution of the code.
- All other variables (`t`, `idx`, `data`, `results`, `n`, `v`, `cnt`, `i`) remain unchanged.

So, the final output state is:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `idx` is `n + 2`
- `data` is a list of strings
- `results` is an empty list
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros
- `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]` (which is `cnt + 0` or simply `cnt`)
- `i` is 1
- `ans` is 0

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `cnt` is `cnt`, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0**
