The given `print` statement is:
```
print('NO')
```

This statement is a simple print statement that prints the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides several conditions and variables, but none of these conditions or variables are used in the `print` statement itself. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string `'NO'` that is being printed.

Output: **NO**
