Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first integer in the new list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of times the integer `tmp` appears consecutively at the end of the new list `a`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive appearances of `tmp` found in the new list `a` before the last sequence, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.** 

The code snippet `tmp = a[0]` assigns the first integer in the list `a` to the variable `tmp`. This does not change the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, `cnt`, or `ans`. The initial state remains valid, with `tmp` now specifically set to the first integer in `a`.
