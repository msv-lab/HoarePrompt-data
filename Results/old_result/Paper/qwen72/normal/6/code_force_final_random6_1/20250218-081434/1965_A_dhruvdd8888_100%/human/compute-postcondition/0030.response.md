Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has been modified such that each element `nums[i]` is reduced by the sum of all previous elements in the list, `nums` must have at least 3 elements, `ls` is equal to the sum of all elements in the modified `nums` list, `i` is `len(nums) - 3`, `nw` is the same as the value of `cw` before the code execution, `cw` is the opposite of the value of `nw` before the code execution.**

Explanation:
- `cw` is assigned the opposite value of `nw`.
- The values of `test_cases`, `N`, `nums`, `ls`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- `nw` remains the same as it was before the code execution.
- `cw` is now the opposite of what `nw` was before the code execution.
