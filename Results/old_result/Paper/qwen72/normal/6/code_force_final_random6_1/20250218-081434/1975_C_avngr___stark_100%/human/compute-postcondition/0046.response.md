Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[i]`, `a[i+1]`, and `a[i+2]`. If `temp[1]` is greater than `max`, `max` is updated to the value of `temp[1]`. Otherwise, `max` retains its original value.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains greater than 4.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The list `temp` is updated to contain the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]` (since `i` is 2 and `i + 3` is 5).
- The condition for updating `max` remains the same: if `temp[1]` (the second element in the sorted list `temp`) is greater than `max`, `max` is updated to `temp[1]`. Otherwise, `max` retains its original value.
