The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `rdb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `rdb`. If `rdb` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively and must have at least 2 elements, and `elem` is the second element in `rdb`. For the loop to execute one more time, `rdb` must have at least 3 elements, and `elem` will be the third element in `rdb`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively and must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in `rdb`. If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is set to 2 and the program continues executing the next statement after the if block. Otherwise, `sz` remains 0 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
