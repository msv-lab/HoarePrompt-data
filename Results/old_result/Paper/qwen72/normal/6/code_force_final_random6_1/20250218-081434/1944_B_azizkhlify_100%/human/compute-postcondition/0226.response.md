Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `l[a[0] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `l[a[1] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `l[a[2] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

The value of `l[a[2] - 1]` is incremented by 1, while the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The increments to `l[a[0] - 1]` and `l[a[1] - 1]` are also still valid.
