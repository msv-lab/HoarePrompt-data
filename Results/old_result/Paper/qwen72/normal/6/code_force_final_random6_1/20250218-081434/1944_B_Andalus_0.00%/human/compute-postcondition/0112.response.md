Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively.
   - `sz` is `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + 1`.
   - `sng` is a list that must have at least two elements.
   - `elem` is the second element in `sng`.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution normally.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is printing the value of `elem`.
   - `elem` is defined as the second element in the list `sng`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `sng` is a list that must have at least two elements, `elem` is the second element of `sng`.
   - The exact value of `elem` is not provided, but we know it is the second element in `sng`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the second element of `sng` followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the second element in the list sng)**
