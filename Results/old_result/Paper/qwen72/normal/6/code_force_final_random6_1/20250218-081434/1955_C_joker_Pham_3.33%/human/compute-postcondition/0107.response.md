Output State: **`l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `l` equals `r`, `sunks` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `k` is now equal to `k - a[l] * 2`. `a[r]` is now equal to `a[r] - a[l]`. If `a[r]` was 0, `sunks` is increased by 1 again, and `r` is now `r - 1`. `sunks` is now `sunks + 1`.**
