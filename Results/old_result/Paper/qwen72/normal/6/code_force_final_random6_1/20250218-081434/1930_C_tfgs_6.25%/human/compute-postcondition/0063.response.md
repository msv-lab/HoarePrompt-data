The code snippet `ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)` appends a new element to the list `ans`. This new element is the result of subtracting 1 from the last element of `ans` before the append operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order
- `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a` but all values in `counter` are now 0
- `cnt` is `cnt - 1` and must be greater than 0
- `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` and additional elements such that the total length of `ans` is `n + 1`, and the last element of `ans` is `ans[-2] - 1`

After the code execution:
- The last element of `ans` is `ans[-2] - 1`
- A new element is appended to `ans`, which is `ans[-2] - 1 - 1` or `ans[-2] - 2`
- The length of `ans` is now `n + 2`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a` but all values in `counter` are now 0, `cnt` is `cnt - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` and additional elements such that the total length of `ans` is `n + 2`, and the last element of `ans` is `ans[-3] - 2`.**
