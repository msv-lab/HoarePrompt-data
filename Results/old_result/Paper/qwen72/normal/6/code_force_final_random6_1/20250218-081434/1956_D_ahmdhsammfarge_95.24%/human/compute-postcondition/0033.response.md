Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 4 < n ≤ 18, `r` is 0 or [1, 2] if `sm` ≤ `over_sum`, otherwise `r` is [1, 3]. `l` is 2 if `sm` ≤ `over_sum`, otherwise `l` is 3. `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `sm` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst` plus 25. `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop or the current value of `sm` if `sm` > `over_sum`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `sm` is updated to the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` (which is just the first element since `i` is 1), plus the sum of the elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst` (which is from index 5 to the end since `j` is 4), plus `(j - i + 1) ** 2` (which is 25 since `j` is 4 and `i` is 1).
- The values of `lst`, `r`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The value of `over_sum` is updated to the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop or the current value of `sm` if `sm` > `over_sum`. However, since this is the first time `sm` is being calculated, `over_sum` is simply the current value of `sm`.
