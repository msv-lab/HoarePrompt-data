The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the input range, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than the input range. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the input range must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 2, `A`, `B`, and `C` are the integers input by the user, split by spaces. If `B * 2 < C`, there are no changes to the variables. Otherwise, if `A` is even, there are no changes to the variables. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`. The input range must be greater than 1.**
