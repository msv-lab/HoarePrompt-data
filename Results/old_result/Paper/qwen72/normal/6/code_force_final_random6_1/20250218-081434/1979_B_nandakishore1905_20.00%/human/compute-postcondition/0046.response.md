The function `func` is intended to accept two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers with the constraints that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x ≠ y. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters, which suggests that the function is incomplete or incorrectly defined. Assuming the function should accept `x` and `y` as parameters, the functionality would be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x ≠ y. The function returns a value based on the relationship between `x` and `y`, but the specific return value or condition is not provided in the given information.**
