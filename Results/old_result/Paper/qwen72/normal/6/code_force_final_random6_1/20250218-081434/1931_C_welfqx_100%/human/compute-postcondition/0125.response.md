Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ii` is `n-2`, `ck` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `onum` that are equal up to the point where the elements are no longer equal or the end of the list is reached, and all other variables (`t`, `r`, `f`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`) remain unchanged. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `num` that are equal plus `ck`. Otherwise, `cn` remains the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `num` that are equal.***
