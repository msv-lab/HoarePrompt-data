### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The function reads from standard input, which is expected to contain multiple test cases.
   - The first line is skipped, and for each subsequent line, it splits the line into two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Diagonal Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the minimum number of cells to be colored using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \left(\frac{k}{2} + k \mod 2\right) \times (k < 4n - 3) + 2n \times (k \geq 4n - 3) + (k == 4n - 2)
     \]
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - \(\frac{k}{2} + k \mod 2\): This part ensures that the number of cells is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\frac{k}{2}\). This is because each cell can contribute to at most 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal).
     - \((k < 4n - 3)\): This condition checks if `k` is less than the total number of diagonals minus one. If true, it uses the first part of the formula.
     - \((k \geq 4n - 3)\): If `k` is greater than or equal to the total number of diagonals minus one, it uses \(2n\) cells, which is the minimum number of cells needed to cover all diagonals.
     - \((k == 4n - 2)\): If `k` is exactly equal to the total number of diagonals, it adds 1 to the result, which is necessary to cover the last diagonal.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - For \(k = 1\), the formula correctly returns 1 (since \(\frac{1}{2} + 1 \mod 2 = 1\)).
   - For \(k = 4n - 2\), the formula correctly returns \(2n + 1\) (since \(\frac{4n - 2}{2} + (4n - 2) \mod 2 = 2n - 1 + 1 = 2n\), and the additional 1 is added for the exact match).

4. **General Case:**
   - For \(k < 4n - 3\), the formula correctly returns the minimum number of cells needed to cover at least `k` diagonals.
   - For \(k \geq 4n - 3\), the formula correctly returns \(2n\) cells, which is the minimum number of cells needed to cover all diagonals.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of cells to be colored for each test case based on the given problem description. The formula used is mathematically sound and handles all edge cases and general cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
