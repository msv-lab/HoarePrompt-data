Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `word` is 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `word` is updated by concatenating the string 'a', the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string, and the string 'z'.
- The value of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `word` is 'a' + the character at index `n - 28` in `alphabet` + 'z'.
