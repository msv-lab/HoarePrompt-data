The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the input integer `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` will be the loop variable starting from 0.

Given the task, the loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
