### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Call:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
   - It then modifies each element of `a` by adding `i + 1` to `a[i]` for all `0 â‰¤ i < n`. This step correctly implements the operation described in the problem statement.

3. **Handling Duplicates and Sorting:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the frequency of each element in the modified array `a`.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts the unique elements in descending order. This ensures that the elements are in the correct order for constructing the lexicographically largest array `b`.

4. **Constructing the Lexicographically Largest Array:**
   - The program initializes `cnt` to the number of elements that were duplicates in the original array.
   - It then iterates over the sorted unique elements of `a` and constructs the array `ans` by:
     - Adding the largest possible elements between the unique elements of `a` without violating the uniqueness and descending order.
     - Ensuring that the total length of `ans` is `n` by appending the necessary number of elements.

5. **Final Adjustments:**
   - After the main loop, the program appends the remaining elements to `ans` to ensure the total length is `n`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.
- The logic for constructing the lexicographically largest array `b` is sound. It ensures that the elements are unique and in descending order, and it fills in the gaps with the largest possible values.
- The use of `Counter` and set operations is appropriate for handling duplicates and ensuring uniqueness.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
