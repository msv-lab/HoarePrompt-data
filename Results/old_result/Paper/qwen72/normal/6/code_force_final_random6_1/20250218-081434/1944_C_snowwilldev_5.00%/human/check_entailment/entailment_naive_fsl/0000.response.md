Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob. Specifically, the logic for determining the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played their turns is flawed. The program simply counts the number of elements that appear exactly once in the array `a` and then prints the first index `i` where the count of elements up to `i` is greater than or equal to 2 or where the count of `i` is 0. This does not accurately reflect the optimal play by Alice to maximize the MEX and Bob to minimize it.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
4
0 1 2 2
```
- **Expected Output:** 3
- **Actual Output:** 2

**Explanation:**
- Alice and Bob will play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX, respectively.
- Alice can start by picking `2` (since it appears twice, she can ensure it is in `c`).
- Bob will then pick `0` (to minimize the MEX).
- Alice will pick `1` (to maximize the MEX).
- Bob will pick the remaining `2`.

At the end, `c` will be `[2, 1]`, and the MEX of `c` is 3. However, the program will output 2, which is incorrect.

This counterexample demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the optimal play for both players, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
