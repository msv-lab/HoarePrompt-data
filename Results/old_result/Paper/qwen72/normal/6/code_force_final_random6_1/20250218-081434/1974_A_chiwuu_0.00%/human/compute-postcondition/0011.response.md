Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first input string, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t` is divisible by 5, `t` is now equal to `2 * b // 5`. Otherwise, `t` is now equal to `2 * b // 5 + 1`.**

Explanation:
- `t1` is assigned the value `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `t` being divisible by 5 and the subsequent assignment of `t` to `2 * b // 5` or `2 * b // 5 + 1` is still valid and has not been altered by the code snippet provided.
