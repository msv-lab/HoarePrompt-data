Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is the input integer from the last iteration, `k` is the input integer from the last iteration, `res` is a list of `n` ones if `k == n`, a range from 0 to `n-1` if `k == 1`, or `[-1]` otherwise.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0, as it was in the initial state.
- The loop counter `_` has reached the value `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variables `n` and `k` hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.
- The variable `res` is determined based on the values of `n` and `k` from the last iteration:
  - If `k` equals `n`, `res` is a list containing `n` ones.
  - If `k` equals 1, `res` is a range from 0 to `n-1`.
  - Otherwise, `res` is `[-1]`.
