Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, `sz` is `min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + min(len(sng), k - min(k, 2 * len(rdb)))`, `sng` is a list that must have at least `min(len(sng), k - min(k, 2 * len(rdb)))` elements, `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was printed, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `T` for the loop to execute again, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**
