To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation of `ans` step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `s` is a list of integers derived from a new input string.
   - `cnt` is a list containing two elements: the number of 0s in `s` and the number of 1s in `s`.
   - `ans` is calculated as follows:
     - The sum of the number of 1s in `s` multiplied by the number of 0s in `s` before each 1.
     - Plus the number of 0s in `s` that come after at least one 1.
   - `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`.

2. **Understanding `cnt`**:
   - `cnt[0]` is the number of 0s in `s`.
   - `cnt[1]` is the number of 1s in `s`.

3. **Calculating `ans`**:
   - For each 1 in `s`, we need to count the number of 0s that appear before it.
   - We then sum these counts.
   - Additionally, we count the number of 0s that appear after at least one 1 in `s`.

4. **Example Calculation**:
   - Suppose `s = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]`.
   - `cnt[0]` (number of 0s) = 3.
   - `cnt[1]` (number of 1s) = 2.
   - For the first 1 in `s`, the number of 0s before it is 1.
   - For the second 1 in `s`, the number of 0s before it is 2.
   - Sum of these counts = 1 + 2 = 3.
   - The number of 0s that come after at least one 1 is 2 (the 0s at indices 2 and 4).
   - Therefore, `ans = 3 + 2 = 5`.

5. **General Case**:
   - The exact value of `ans` depends on the specific list `s`.
   - However, based on the given formula, `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s in `s` multiplied by the number of 0s in `s` before each 1, plus the number of 0s in `s` that come after at least one 1.

Since the exact list `s` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe the value of `ans` in terms of the given conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the number of 1s in s multiplied by the number of 0s in s before each 1, plus the number of 0s in s that come after at least one 1)**
