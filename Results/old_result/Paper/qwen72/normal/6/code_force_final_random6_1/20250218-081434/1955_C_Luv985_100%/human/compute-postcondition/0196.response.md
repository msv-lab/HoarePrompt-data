Output State: **`t` is the result of `k % 2`, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` where `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**

Explanation:
- `t` is now the remainder when `k` is divided by 2. This means `t` can be either 0 or 1.
- All other variables (`k`, `a`, `T`, `l`, `r`, `ans`, `mi`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
