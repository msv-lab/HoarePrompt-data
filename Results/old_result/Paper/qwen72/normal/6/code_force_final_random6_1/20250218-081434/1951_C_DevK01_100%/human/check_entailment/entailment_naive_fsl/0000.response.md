Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle the price increase correctly after purchasing tickets on a given day. According to the problem description, if you purchase \( x \) tickets on day \( i \), the prices for all subsequent days should increase by \( x \). However, the program does not update the prices for subsequent days after each purchase, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 100 1
10000 1 100 10 1000
```
The expected output is 1, as you can purchase 1 ticket on the second day with the minimum cost of 1. However, the program will not correctly handle the price increase after each purchase, leading to an incorrect result.

Another example:
```
1
4 2 3
8 6 4 2
```
The expected output is 10. The optimal strategy is to buy 1 ticket on the third day (cost 4) and 2 tickets on the fourth day (cost 6), resulting in a total cost of 10. However, the program does not correctly handle the price increase after each purchase, which can lead to an incorrect result.

The program needs to be modified to correctly update the prices for subsequent days after each purchase to ensure it meets the problem description's requirements.
