Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment[0]` is `arr[0]` - 1, and the first element of `arr` (i.e., `arr[0]`) is less than 0. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is [0, 0, -1]. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to be equal to `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [i - 1].**

Explanation:
- The code `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` increments the first element of `max_segment` by the value of `arr[0]`.
- Initially, `max_segment[0]` is -1 and `arr[0]` is a negative integer (less than 0).
- After execution, `max_segment[0]` becomes `arr[0]` - 1, which is still a negative value.
- The values of `arr`, `i`, `new_segment`, and `max_sum` remain unchanged.
- The condition for updating `max_segment` and `segments_variants` remains the same as described in the initial state.
