Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the size of the array for each test case. It then reads the array elements and processes them one by one.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes two lists `a` and `b` to store the subsequences and a variable `cp` (which is not used in the code).

3. **Subsequence Assignment Logic**:
   - The program iterates through each element of the array `lit`.
   - It checks the last elements of `a` and `b` (if they exist) to decide where to place the current element.
   - The logic for placing elements in `a` or `b` is based on comparisons between the last elements of `a` and `b` and the current element `lit[i]`.

4. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - After assigning all elements to `a` or `b`, the program calculates the penalty for each subsequence.
   - It counts the number of indices where the current element is greater than the previous element in both `a` and `b`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the total penalty for each test case.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

- **Incorrect Subsequence Assignment**:
  - The current logic for assigning elements to `a` or `b` is overly complex and does not guarantee the optimal split.
  - The conditions for appending elements to `a` or `b` are not consistent and may lead to suboptimal splits.

- **Optimal Split**:
  - The optimal way to minimize the penalty is to ensure that the subsequences `s` and `t` are as non-increasing as possible.
  - This can be achieved by sorting the array and then splitting it into two non-increasing subsequences.

6. **Simplified Approach**:
  - A simpler and more effective approach would be to sort the array and then split it into two subsequences such that each subsequence is non-increasing.
  - This ensures that the penalty is minimized because there will be no increasing pairs within each subsequence.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly implement the optimal solution for minimizing the penalty. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
