Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `v` is the last vertex in the stack, `postorder` is the last boolean value in the stack, and `stack` is the stack with the last tuple removed. If `postorder` is True, for each child `u` of `v`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been updated to its initial value plus the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all children `u` of `v`. Additionally, for each child `u` of `v` where `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been updated to its initial value plus the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all such children `u`. For each child `u` of `v` where `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is further incremented by 1. If `postorder` is False, `stack` has the tuple `(v, True)` followed by tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v` appended to it.***
