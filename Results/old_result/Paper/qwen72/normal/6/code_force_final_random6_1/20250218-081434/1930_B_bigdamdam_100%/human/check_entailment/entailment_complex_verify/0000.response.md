### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` does not take any parameters, which is acceptable for this problem since it reads input directly from the user.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` (the length of the permutation) and initializes a list `p` of length `n` filled with zeros.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The variable `ind` is initialized to `n`. This will be used to fill the even indices of the permutation `p` with the largest numbers in descending order.
   - The first loop iterates over the even indices of `p` (0, 2, 4, ...), filling them with values from `ind` and decrementing `ind` by 2 each time.
   - After the first loop, `ind` is reset to `1 + n % 2`. This ensures that the smallest numbers start from 1 if `n` is odd, or 2 if `n` is even.
   - The second loop iterates over the odd indices of `p` (1, 3, 5, ...), filling them with values from `ind` and incrementing `ind` by 2 each time.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the generated permutation `p` for each test case.

4. **Validation of the Permutation:**
   - The permutation is constructed such that the even indices contain the largest numbers in descending order, and the odd indices contain the smallest numbers in ascending order.
   - This construction ensures that no two consecutive numbers in the permutation can both divide two other consecutive numbers. For example:
     - If `n` is 4, the permutation might be `[4, 1, 2, 3]`. Here, 4 (even index) is the largest, 1 (odd index) is the smallest, 2 (even index) is the next largest, and 3 (odd index) is the next smallest.
     - If `n` is 3, the permutation might be `[3, 1, 2]`. Here, 3 (even index) is the largest, 1 (odd index) is the smallest, and 2 (even index) is the next largest.
   - This approach works for all valid inputs within the constraints (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the minimum value of `n` (3) correctly.
   - The program also handles larger values of `n` (up to 10^5) correctly by following the same logic.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly generates a permutation for each test case that satisfies the given conditions. It ensures that no two consecutive numbers in the permutation can both divide two other consecutive numbers, and it handles the input and output correctly.

Final: **True**
