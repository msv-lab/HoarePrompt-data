You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import  math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, where `a` and `b` are positive integers. It then calculates a sum `suma` based on a specific formula involving `a` and `b`. The final result for each test case is `suma - 2`, which is printed to the output. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `T` is an input integer, `t` is `T - 1`, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]` from the last iteration, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` from the last iteration, and `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values for each iteration from 1 to `b` for each of the `T` iterations, with any additional 1s added when the conditions `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. Specifically, the logic used to determine the number of valid pairs is flawed. Here is a potential case where the program does not work correctly:

**Test Case:**
```
1
2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

The expected output is 3 because the valid pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2). However, the program outputs 1, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the way the program calculates the number of valid pairs. The formula used in the program:
```python
x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
```
and the subsequent checks:
```python
if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
    suma += x
    if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
        suma += 1
```
do not correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem description. The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs (a, b) and checking if the sum \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current logic does not ensure this condition is met for all pairs.
