Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string that must have at least 3 integers, `c` is the third integer in `s`, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`, `cnt` is updated based on the value of `c` as follows: if `c` is 1, `cnt` is `[1, 2]` or `[0, 3]`; if `c` is 0, `cnt` is `[3, 0]` or `[2, 1]`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is increased by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged. If `c` is 1, `ans` is updated by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]` to its current value.***
