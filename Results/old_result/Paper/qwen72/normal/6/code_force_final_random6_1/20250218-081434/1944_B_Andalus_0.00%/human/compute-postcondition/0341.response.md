The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If `sng` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `elem` is not relevant to the loop's execution condition; it will be set by the loop itself during the first iteration. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `sng` must have at least one element.

State: **`sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the number of elements processed in `rdb`, `elem` is the last element in `rdb` that was processed before the loop broke or finished, `rdb` must have at least enough elements to satisfy the condition `sz < k` before the loop breaks, and `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0, `sng` must have at least 1 element**
