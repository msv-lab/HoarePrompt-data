Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to be called with parameters in the context of a test case, where the first parameter is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of parameters for each test case. Each pair consists of two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the array and the number of operations, respectively, and a list of `n` integers `a` (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the array. The sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c = 0
    maxi = 0
    for ele in l:
        if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
            maxi = max(c, maxi)
            c = 0
        else:
            c += ele
            maxi = max(c, maxi)
    maxi = max(c, maxi)
    print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is the sum of the non-negative integers in the list `l` that have not been interrupted by a negative integer with an absolute value greater than or equal to the current sum, and `maxi` is the maximum of the current `c` and the previous `maxi`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is the sum of the positive elements in `l` that are not immediately preceded by a negative element whose absolute value is greater than or equal to the current sum, `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` and `maxi` observed during the loop execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least `n` elements, `c` is the sum of the non-negative elements in the list `l` up to the last non-negative element before a negative element that resets `c` to 0, or 0 if the last element processed is negative and `c` was reset to 0, `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` encountered during the loop execution, which represents the maximum sum of contiguous non-negative elements in the list `l` before any negative element reset `c` to 0, and `maxi` is now the maximum of the current `c` and the previous `maxi`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
