Output State: **`ans[0]` remains `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is now the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[1]` that can be expressed as a sum of `arr[0] + 1` added multiple times to `3 * arr[0] + 2`, and all other elements in `ans` remain unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- **`ans[0]`**: This value remains `arr[0] + 1` throughout the loop because it is not modified inside the loop.
- **`ans[1]`**: Initially, `ans[1]` is set to `3 * arr[0] + 2`. The loop condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` ensures that `ans[1]` will keep increasing by `ans[0]` (which is `arr[0] + 1`) until it is greater than or equal to `arr[1]`. Therefore, after the loop completes, `ans[1]` will be the smallest value that is greater than or equal to `arr[1]` and can be expressed as `3 * arr[0] + 2 + k * (arr[0] + 1)` for some integer `k`.
- **All other elements in `ans`**: These elements remain unchanged because the loop only modifies `ans[1]` and does not affect any other elements in the list. The condition that `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to `3 * arr[0] + 2` is necessary for the loop to execute at least once, and the condition that `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to `3 * arr[0] + 2 + (arr[0] + 1)` is necessary for the loop to execute at least twice, and so on.
