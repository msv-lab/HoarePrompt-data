Output State: **`sumo` is `int(a[0])`, `bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space, `T` is `T + 1`, `t` must be greater than `T`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- `sumo` is incremented by the integer value of `a[0]`, so `sumo` is now `int(a[0])`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
