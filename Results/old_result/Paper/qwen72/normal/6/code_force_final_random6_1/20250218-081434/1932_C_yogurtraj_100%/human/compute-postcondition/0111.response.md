Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If `t[i]` is 'R', `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m` and `q2` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is decremented by 1. `y[i]` is now equal to `k`.** 

The value of `y[i]` is updated to the current value of `k`. The other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
