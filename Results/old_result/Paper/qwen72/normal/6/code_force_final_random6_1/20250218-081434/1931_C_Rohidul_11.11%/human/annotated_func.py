#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= n. The function should be designed to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        l, r = 0, n - 1
        
        st, end = 0, 0
        
        while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
            l += 1
            st += 1
        
        while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
            r -= 1
            end += 1
        
        if a[0] == a[-1]:
            ans = r - l - 1
        elif st == 0 and end == 0 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            ans = len(a) - 1
        else:
            ans = r - l
        
        print(max(0, ans))
        
    #State: After all iterations, `_` is the total number of test cases processed, `n` is the last input integer for the number of elements in the list `a`, `a` is the last list of integers provided by the user, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element or `r` if all elements up to `r` are equal, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to the next element or `l` if all elements from `l` to the end are equal, `st` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list `a` that are equal to the element after them, `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal to the element before them, `ans` is the maximum of 0 and the calculated answer based on the conditions: if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. If the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a` and `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `r - l`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the length of the longest subarray of `a` that does not contain consecutive equal elements, after removing the maximum number of consecutive equal elements from both the start and the end of the list. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state includes the processed test cases, the last input integer `n`, the last list of integers `a`, and the calculated results for each test case.
