Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, `arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`, and `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements being zeros.**

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `t` remains within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The value of `_` remains 1.
- The list `l1` remains unchanged.
- The value of `n` remains the integer value of the first element in `l1`.
- The value of `k` is now 0, indicating that the loop has completed.
- The value of `k0` remains the original integer value of the second element in `l1`.
- The value of `i` is now the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`.
- The list `arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`.
- The list `ans` remains a list of length `n` with all elements being zeros.
