### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Function Call:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the array `arr`.

2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes a frequency list `freq` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - It iterates through `arr` and increments the corresponding index in `freq` for each element in `arr`.

3. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The function initializes a counter `cou` to 0.
   - It iterates through the range `[0, n]` to check the frequency of each integer.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once in `arr`, it increments `cou`.
   - If `cou` reaches 2 or if an integer `i` does not appear in `arr` (i.e., `freq[i] == 0`), it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, it prints the last integer in the range `[0, n]` that has a frequency of 0 or 1.

4. **Optimal Play:**
   - Alice and Bob play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c`, respectively.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the smallest integer that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once, which aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Frequency Calculation:**
  - The frequency list `freq` is correctly initialized and populated.
  - The loop ensures that each integer in `arr` is counted accurately.

- **Correctness of MEX Calculation:**
  - The loop checks for the smallest integer that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once.
  - This approach is correct because:
    - If an integer `i` does not appear in `arr`, it is the smallest MEX.
    - If an integer `i` appears exactly once, it is a candidate for the MEX, and the loop ensures that the smallest such integer is chosen.
    - If `cou` reaches 2, it means that there are at least two integers that appear exactly once, and the smallest one is chosen.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where all integers in `arr` appear at least twice by printing the smallest integer that does not appear.
  - It also handles the case where `arr` is empty or contains only one element.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal play of Alice and Bob. The frequency calculation and MEX determination are both accurate and handle all edge cases as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
