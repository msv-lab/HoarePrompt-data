Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `ii` is `n-2`, `ck` is 1, `r` is `r+1`, `t` is greater than `r+1`, `f` is 1, `j` is the index where the first inequality is found if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n-2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of the list `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the list `num`, `symb2` is the last element of the list `num`. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is 3. Otherwise, if `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is 2. If `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
