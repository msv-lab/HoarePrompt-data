Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element, `a` is a list that now includes the second element of `lit` (i.e., `lit[1]`), if `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity; otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`. If `a` is now a non-empty list, `x` is set to the last element of `a` (i.e., `lit[1]`); otherwise, `x` is set to infinity.**
