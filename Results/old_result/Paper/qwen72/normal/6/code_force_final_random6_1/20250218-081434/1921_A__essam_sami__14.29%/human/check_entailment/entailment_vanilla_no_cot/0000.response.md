Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the area of the square. The logic used in the program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and then prints the smaller of the two. However, this does not guarantee that the correct side length of the square is being used to calculate the area.

To correctly solve this problem, you should:
1. Identify the unique x and y coordinates from the four points.
2. Compute the side length of the square as the difference between the unique x coordinates or the unique y coordinates.
3. Calculate the area as the side length squared.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Extract unique x and y coordinates
        x_coords = sorted(set(point[0] for point in points))
        y_coords = sorted(set(point[1] for point in points))
        
        # Calculate the side length of the square
        side_length = x_coords[1] - x_coords[0]  # or y_coords[1] - y_coords[0]
        
        # Calculate and print the area
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)

# Example usage
# func()
```

This version correctly identifies the side length of the square by finding the unique x and y coordinates and then calculates the area.
