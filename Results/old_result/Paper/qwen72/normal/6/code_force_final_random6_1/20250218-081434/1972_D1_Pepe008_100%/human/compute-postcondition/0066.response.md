Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 0, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is the result of the expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to the result of the expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
