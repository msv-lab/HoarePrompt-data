Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements being zeros.**

The code `k0 = k` assigns the value of `k` to `k0`. Since `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `k0` now also holds that same integer value. All other variables remain unchanged.
