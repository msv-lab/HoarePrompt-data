The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is set to `n-1`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute. For the loop to execute, `i` should start from 0, and `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
