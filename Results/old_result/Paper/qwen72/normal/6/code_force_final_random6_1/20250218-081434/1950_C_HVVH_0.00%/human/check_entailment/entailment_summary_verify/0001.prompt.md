You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

Example

Input

    11
    
    09:41
    
    18:06
    
    12:14
    
    00:59
    
    00:00
    
    14:34
    
    01:01
    
    19:07
    
    11:59
    
    12:00
    
    21:37

Output

    09:41 AM
    06:06 PM
    12:14 PM
    12:59 AM
    12:00 AM
    02:34 PM
    01:01 AM
    07:07 PM
    11:59 AM
    12:00 PM
    09:37 PM

- Program:
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'PM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, then for `n` times, it reads a time in the format "hh:mm" from the user, converts the 24-hour format to a 12-hour format, and prints the converted time along with the appropriate AM/PM indicator. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the program state is unchanged except for the printed output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. This is correct as per the problem description.
2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `n` times, each time reading a time string in the format `hh:mm`. This is also correct.
3. **Time Conversion**:
   - The program splits the input string into `h` (hours) and `m` (minutes) using `input().split(':')` and converts them to integers. This is correct.
   - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'. This is correct because 00:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 AM in 12-hour format.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'. This is correct because hours from 13 to 23 in 24-hour format should be converted to 1 to 11 in 12-hour format with 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, it sets `day` to 'AM'. This is incorrect because 12:00 in 24-hour format should be 12:00 PM in 12-hour format, not AM.
   - For hours from 1 to 11, it sets `day` to 'PM'. This is incorrect because these hours should be 'AM' in the 12-hour format.

4. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the time in the format `'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}'`, which ensures leading zeros are preserved and the time is correctly formatted. This is correct.

Given the issues in the time conversion logic, the program is incorrect.
