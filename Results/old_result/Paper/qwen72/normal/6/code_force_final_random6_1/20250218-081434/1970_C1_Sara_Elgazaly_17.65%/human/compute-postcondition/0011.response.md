Output State: **`x` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers based on the new input, `lst[a]` is a list that includes `b` as its last element, `lst[b]` is a list that includes `a` as its last element twice.**

The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs from the user, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. The values of `x` and `_` remain unchanged, and the lists `lst[a]` and `lst[b]` retain their previous states, with `lst[a]` including `b` as its last element and `lst[b]` including `a` as its last element twice.
