Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` where `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is 0, `n` is an integer, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, and `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`.**
