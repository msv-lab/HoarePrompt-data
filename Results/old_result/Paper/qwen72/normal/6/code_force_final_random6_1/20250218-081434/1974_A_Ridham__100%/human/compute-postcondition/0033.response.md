The code snippet `result.append(screen_require_for_y)` adds the value of `screen_require_for_y` to the list `result`. The value of `screen_require_for_y` depends on whether `y` is even or odd, as specified in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 1, `result` is a list containing `screen_require_for_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`. If `y` is an even integer, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`, and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2) - (y * 4)`. If `y` is an odd integer, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - (y * 4)`.**
