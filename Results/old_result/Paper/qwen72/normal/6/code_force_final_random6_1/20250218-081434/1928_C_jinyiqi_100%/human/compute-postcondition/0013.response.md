Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is a list containing `[1, 2, 3]` if `x` is divisible by both `1` and `2`, otherwise `output1` remains `[1, 3]`. `output2` is a list containing `[x, x // 2, x // 3]` if `x` is divisible by both `1` and `2`, otherwise `output2` is a list containing `[x, x // 3]`. `i` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` remains unchanged.
- The value of `output1` remains the same as it was in the initial state.
- The value of `output2` is updated by appending the result of `int(x / i)`. Since `i` is 3, `int(x / i)` is `x // 3`.
- If `x` is divisible by both `1` and `2`, `output2` was initially `[x, x // 2]`, and after appending `x // 3`, it becomes `[x, x // 2, x // 3]`.
- If `x` is not divisible by both `1` and `2`, `output2` was initially `[x]`, and after appending `x // 3`, it becomes `[x, x // 3]`.
- The value of `i` remains 3.
