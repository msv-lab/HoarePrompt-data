Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `lit[2]` is greater than `y`, `a` now includes the element `lit[2]` as its last element. If `lit[2]` is greater than or equal to `y` and `lit[2]` is greater than `x`, the list `b` now contains the element `lit[2]` at its end. Otherwise, the list `b` remains unchanged.***
