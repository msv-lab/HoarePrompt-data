Output State: **`arr` contains the indices of the bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `c` is `c + 1`, if `c` is equal to `n - 1`, a new element equal to `k0 - sum(ans)` is appended to `ans` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the program continues without modifying `ans`.**
