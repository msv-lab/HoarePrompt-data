Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string with length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`, `i` is either 7, 5, or 3, `ans` is either 2, 1, or 0, and `len(a)` must be greater than `i + 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
- If `i` was 6, it is now 7.
- If `i` was 4, it is now 5.
- If `i` was 2, it is now 3.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `len(a) > i + 2` still holds true with the new value of `i`.
