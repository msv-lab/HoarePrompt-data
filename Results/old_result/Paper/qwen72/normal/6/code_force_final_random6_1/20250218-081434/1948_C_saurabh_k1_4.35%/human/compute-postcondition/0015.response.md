Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` and `b` are lists of strings where each string is a character from the new input string. If the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`, then `_` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `_`. If the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is not the string `"<"`, then `_` is also incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `_`.***
