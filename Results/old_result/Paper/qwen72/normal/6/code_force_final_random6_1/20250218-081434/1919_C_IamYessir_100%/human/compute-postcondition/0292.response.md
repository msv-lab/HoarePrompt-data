Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element. If `b` is empty, `y` is set to positive infinity. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to positive infinity. If `a` is not empty, `x` is the last element of `a`. `a` now contains the second element of `lit`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` adds the second element of the list `lit` (since `i` is 1) to the list `a`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. If `a` was initially empty, it now contains the second element of `lit`. If `a` was not empty, the last element of `a` is now the second element of `lit`. The value of `x` is updated to this new last element of `a`.
