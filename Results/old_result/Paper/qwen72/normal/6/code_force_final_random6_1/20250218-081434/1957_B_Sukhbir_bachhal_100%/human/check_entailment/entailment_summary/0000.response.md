### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.
   - The sequence should maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all the integers in the sequence.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, it constructs the sequence as follows:
     - It uses `func_1` to find the highest bit position in the binary representation of `k`.
     - It appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the sequence, where `counter` is the highest bit position.
     - It appends `k - arr[-1]` to the sequence, which ensures the sum of the first two elements is `k`.
     - It appends `0` for the remaining `n-2` elements.
   - If `n` is 1, it simply prints `k`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` returns the highest bit position in the binary representation of `n` minus one.
   - This is achieved by right-shifting `n` until it becomes 0, counting the number of shifts.
   - The function returns `-1` if `n` is 0, but this case is not relevant since `k` is guaranteed to be at least 1.

4. **Behavior Analysis:**
   - The sequence construction ensures that the sum of the elements is `k`.
   - The first element `2 ** counter - 1` is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of `k`.
   - The second element is `k - (2 ** counter - 1)`, which ensures the sum is `k`.
   - The remaining elements are `0`, which do not affect the bitwise OR operation.

5. **Maximizing the Number of 1s:**
   - The bitwise OR of `2 ** counter - 1` and `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` will have all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of `k`.
   - This maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the OR result.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - For `n = 1`, the program correctly prints `k`.
   - For `n > 1`, the program constructs a sequence that meets the conditions and maximizes the number of 1s in the OR result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the sequence for each test case, ensuring the sum is `k` and maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation of the OR result. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
