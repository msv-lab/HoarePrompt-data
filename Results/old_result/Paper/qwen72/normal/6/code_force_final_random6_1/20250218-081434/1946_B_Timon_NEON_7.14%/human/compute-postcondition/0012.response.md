Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is not an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and the first element of `arr` (i.e., `arr[0]`) is less than 0. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is [0, 0, -1]. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to be equal to `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is `new_segment` + [i - 1].***
