Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of integers, `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing the range of an operation, and `ops` now includes an additional inner list `[r + 1, r + 1]`. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met, and `ops` still includes the additional inner list `[r + 1, l + 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])` adds a new inner list `[r + 1, r + 1]` to the list `ops`.
- The values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged.
- The list `lst` remains unchanged.
- The condition about the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` being 0 or not is still valid.
- The list `ops` now includes the additional inner list `[r + 1, r + 1]` in addition to the previously added `[r + 1, l + 1]`.
