Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum found during the loop, `segments_variants` is a list of all segments that were considered but not chosen as the `max_segment`, `new_segment` is a list containing the sum of the last segment and the index of the last element in that segment, and the last element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0. `total_max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum from all the segments in `segments_variants` that were considered during the loop, and the length of `total_max_segment` is 1.**
