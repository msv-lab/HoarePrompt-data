Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the input. It then calculates a value `ans` based on `n` and `m` using a specific formula and prints the integer value of `ans`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `m` are the final input integers for the last test case, `t` is the total number of test cases, `i` is `t - 1`, `count` is `m + 1`, and `ans` is the final calculated value for the last test case. **
