Output State: **`tc` is 1 or 2, `N` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default type int where `cnt[a[i]]` is the count of how many times each integer in `a` appeared in the list `a` from index 0 to `N-1`. `t` is incremented by 1. If `t` is now greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, then `t` is set to 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `t` remains incremented by 1 and `cnt[a[i]]` is 1.**
