Postcondition: ***`arr` contains the indices of the bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `c` is `c + 2`, `ans` now contains an additional element which is `1 << i`. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` also contains an additional element which is `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
