Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 2`, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` is the count of occurrences of `a[j]` in the list `a`, `r` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except `r[a[n] - 1]` which is now 1 and `r[a[i] - 1]` which is now 2, `res` is an empty list, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `re` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` by 1.
- Initially, `r[a[i] - 1]` was 1, so after the increment, it becomes 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
