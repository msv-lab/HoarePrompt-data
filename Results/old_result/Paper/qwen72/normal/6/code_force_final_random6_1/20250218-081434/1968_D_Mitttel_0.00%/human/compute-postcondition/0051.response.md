Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract multiple sets of parameters, and calls `func_1` for each set. It then prints the results of each call to `func_1`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, `input` remains a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `index` is reset to 0, and `results` is a list containing the values returned by `func_1` for each set of parameters. **
