Output State: **`L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input provided by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second integer in `L` and the third integer in `L`, `k` is the third integer in `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `cost` and `N` are not yet defined, and `mu` is not yet defined.**

Explanation:
- The code `M = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `M` to a list of integers converted from the user input.
- The initial state mentions that `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input provided by the user, which is now updated.
- All other variables (`L`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `cost`, `N`, and `mu`) remain unchanged or are still not defined.
