The function reads input from standard input, processes `t` test cases, where each test case contains an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the exponents of the lengths of sticks. For each test case, it calculates the number of ways to choose pairs and triplets of sticks with the same exponent. The function then prints the results for each test case, with each result being the string representation of the calculated number of combinations. After the function concludes, `t` is 0, `idx` is equal to the length of the input data, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list of strings containing the results for each test case, and the final state of the program is that the results have been printed to the standard output.
