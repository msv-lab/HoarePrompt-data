Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    c = input().strip()
    results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string that holds the user input after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a string that holds the new user input after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is a string that holds the latest user input after stripping leading and trailing whitespace.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` (one additional result appended), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the new stripped input string, `c` is the new stripped input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` (one additional result appended), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the new stripped input string, `b` is the new stripped input string, `c` is the new stripped input string, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
