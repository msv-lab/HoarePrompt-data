Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[l]`, `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l]`, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is n - 2 or n - 3, `sunks` is 1, 2, or 3. If `l` == `r`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The value of `r` is decremented by 1, so `r` is now either `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on its initial value. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
