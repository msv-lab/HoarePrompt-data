### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a` of length `2n`.
   - It initializes two arrays `l` and `r` of length `n` to keep track of the count of each integer in the first and second halves of `a`, respectively.
   - It also initializes variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` to zero, and an empty list `res` to store additional integers.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The function counts the occurrences of each integer in the first half of `a` and stores it in `l`.
   - It counts the occurrences of each integer in the second half of `a` and stores it in `r`.

3. **Forming Subarray `l`:**
   - The function iterates through the first half of `a` and checks if an integer appears twice in `l`.
   - If an integer appears twice, it prints the integer twice and resets its count in `l`.
   - It keeps track of the number of integers printed in `ul`.
   - If `ul` reaches `2k`, it breaks the loop.

4. **Handling Remaining Integers for `l`:**
   - If `ul` is less than `2k`, the function iterates through the first half of `a` again to find integers that appear once in `l`.
   - It prints these integers and appends them to `res`.
   - It keeps track of the number of integers printed in `re`.
   - If `re` reaches the required number of additional integers, it breaks the loop.

5. **Forming Subarray `r`:**
   - The function prints the integers stored in `res` from the first half.
   - It then iterates through the second half of `a` to find integers that appear twice in `r`.
   - If an integer appears twice, it prints the integer twice and resets its count in `r`.
   - It keeps track of the number of integers printed in `ur`.
   - If `ul` equals `ur`, it breaks the loop.

### Issues and Concerns:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Forming `r`:**
   - The function does not correctly ensure that the subarray `r` is formed from the second half of `a`.
   - The condition `if ul != ur` is used to form `r`, but this is not necessary. The subarray `r` should always be formed from the second half of `a`.
   - The function may print integers from the first half of `a` again, which is incorrect.

2. **Incorrect XOR Calculation:**
   - The function does not explicitly calculate the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` to ensure they are equal.
   - The problem requires that the XOR of elements in `l` should be equal to the XOR of elements in `r`.

3. **Inefficient and Incomplete Logic:**
   - The function does not handle the case where the XOR of elements in `l` and `r` might not be equal, even though the problem guarantees that at least one solution always exists.
   - The logic for forming `l` and `r` is incomplete and may not always produce valid subarrays.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It has logical issues in forming the subarrays `l` and `r` and does not ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of elements in `r`.

**Correctness: False**
