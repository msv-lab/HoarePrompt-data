Postcondition: ***`t` is equal to `b * 2 // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is equal to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. `n` is greater than 2. `i` is 2. `a` is the integer value of the first input string. `b` is the integer value of the second input string. `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t` is updated based on the condition `t2 % 15 == 0`: if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`; otherwise, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.***
