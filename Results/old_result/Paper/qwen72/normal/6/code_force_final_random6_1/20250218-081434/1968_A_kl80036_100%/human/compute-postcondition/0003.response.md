Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This means `t` can be any integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
   - `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each of the `t` test cases. This means `x` can be any integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive.
   - `i` is 0. This variable is not used in the `print` statement.
   - `y` is calculated as `x - 1`. Since `x` is between 2 and 1000, `y` will be an integer between 1 and 999, inclusive.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(y)`.
   - `y` is the value of `x - 1`.

Given the initial state, `y` is an integer that is one less than `x`. Since `x` is between 2 and 1000, `y` will be between 1 and 999.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the value of `y`, which is `x - 1`.

Output: **y (where y is an integer such that 1 <= y <= 999, and y = x - 1)**
