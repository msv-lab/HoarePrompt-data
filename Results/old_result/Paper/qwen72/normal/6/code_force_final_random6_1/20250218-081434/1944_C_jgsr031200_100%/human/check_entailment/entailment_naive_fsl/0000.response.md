Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem. The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the final score of the game, which is the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. However, the function does not simulate the game turns or the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Instead, it simply counts the number of unique elements in the array `arr` and prints the first index where the frequency of an element is less than 2.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 1 2 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- The array `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, 2, 3]`.
- Alice and Bob play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX of `c`, respectively.
- A possible optimal game could be:
  1. Alice picks `2` (since it appears twice and can be used to delay the MEX).
  2. Bob picks `0`.
  3. Alice picks `2` again.
  4. Bob picks `1`.
  5. Alice picks `3`.

- The final array `c` would be `[2, 2, 3]`, and the MEX of `c` is `4`.

However, the provided program prints `2` because it incorrectly assumes that the MEX is the first index where the frequency of an element is less than 2, which is not the correct approach to simulate the game and determine the MEX.
