To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` is 0 if `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2 for any `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, and each other element at index `a[j] - 1` is the count of occurrences of `a[j]` in the list `a`.
   - `r` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` for `j` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` is incremented by 1.
   - `res` is a list containing the element `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `res` remains an empty list.
   - `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` that had a count of 2 in `l` before the loop started.
   - `ur` is 0.
   - `re` is 1 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `re` is 0.
   - `k` is `2 * k - ul` and the current value of `k` is non-zero. If `re` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is 1, so we are looking at the second element of the list `a` (since list indices are 0-based).
   - The value of `a[i]` is `a[1]`.
   - The variable `re` is determined by the value of `l[a[i] - 1]`. If `l[a[1] - 1]` is 1, then `re` is 1; otherwise, `re` is 0.
   - The variable `k` is `2 * k - ul`, and it is given that `k` is non-zero.
   - If `re` equals `k`, the loop or if statement is broken, but this condition is not directly relevant to the `print` statement itself.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the value of `a[1]` followed by a space.
   - Since `i` is 1, the value printed will be the second element of the list `a`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be the second element of the list `a` followed by a space.

Output: **a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list `a`)**
