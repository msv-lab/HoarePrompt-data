Output State: **`row` is a list of integers representing the depths of a row in the river grid, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d < len(row), `i` is `d`, `min_heap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from the first `d` elements of `row` and its corresponding index, and `min_heap` is now a valid min-heap.**

The `pass` statement does not change any variables or state, so the initial state remains unchanged.
