Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 45, `i` is 9, `values[0]` is 0, `values[1]` is 1, `values[2]` is 2, `values[3]` is 3, `values[4]` is 4, `values[5]` is 5, `values[6]` is 6, `values[7]` is 7, `values[8]` is 8, `values[9]` is 9, `sum_values[0]` is 0, `sum_values[1]` is 1, `sum_values[2]` is 3, `sum_values[3]` is 6, `sum_values[4]` is 10, `sum_values[5]` is 15, `sum_values[6]` is 21, `sum_values[7]` is 28, `sum_values[8]` is 36, `sum_values[9]` is 45.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all 10 iterations:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged and must be greater than or equal to 0.
- The list `numbers` remains unchanged and contains `t` input integers, each between 1 and 200,000.
- The list `values` is updated such that `values[i]` is equal to `i` for `i` from 0 to 9.
- The list `sum_values` is updated such that `sum_values[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` integers (i.e., the sum of integers from 0 to `i`).
- The variable `total` is the sum of the first 10 integers (0 through 9), which is 45.
- The variable `i` is 9, indicating that the loop has completed its 10th iteration.
