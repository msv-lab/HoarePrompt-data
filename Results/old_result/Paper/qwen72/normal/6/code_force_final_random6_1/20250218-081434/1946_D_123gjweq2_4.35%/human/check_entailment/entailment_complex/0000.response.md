Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments `k` such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to a given number `x`. The provided functions, however, do not correctly implement this logic.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to solve the problem, but it calls `find_max(arr, 31)` and returns the result.
   - The parameter `x` is not used within `func_1`, which is a critical oversight since `x` is essential for determining the maximum number of segments.

2. **Function `find_max`**:
   - The function `find_max` is designed to recursively find the maximum number of segments, but it does not correctly handle the bitwise operations as described in the problem.
   - The function processes the array to create a new array `new_arr` based on the XOR results and the current bit position, but it does not consider the bitwise OR operation with `x`.
   - The function returns the length of `cur_arr` when `bit` is -1, which is not the correct behavior. It should return the maximum number of segments that satisfy the condition.
   - The function also does not correctly handle the case where the final XOR value has a bit set to 1 at the current bit position. It sets `thing1` to -1, but this does not align with the problem's requirement to find the maximum number of segments.

Given these issues, the provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
