Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, and then reads `t` integers, each representing the largest number for each test case. It calculates the sum of a sequence of values for each number up to the largest number in the test cases, where each value is determined by the sum of the value of the last digit and the value of the remaining digits of the number. The function prints the cumulative sum of these values for each test case number. The function does not return any value.
