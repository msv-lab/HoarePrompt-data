Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `cn` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `num` that are equal, `n` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 1. If `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, `ck` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, all other variables remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
