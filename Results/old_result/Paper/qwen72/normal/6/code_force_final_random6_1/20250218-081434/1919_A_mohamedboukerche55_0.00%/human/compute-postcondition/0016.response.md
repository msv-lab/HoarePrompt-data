Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `int(input()) - 1`.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
   - `s` is the final input string.
   - `a` is the integer value of the first word in the final input string `s`.
   - `b` is the integer value of the second word in the final input string `s`.
   - The sum of `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('alice')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet simply contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'alice'`.
   - The initial state provides information about the variables `i`, `s`, `a`, and `b`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
   - The condition that the sum of `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2 is also not relevant to the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, it will always print the string `'alice'`.

Output: **alice**
