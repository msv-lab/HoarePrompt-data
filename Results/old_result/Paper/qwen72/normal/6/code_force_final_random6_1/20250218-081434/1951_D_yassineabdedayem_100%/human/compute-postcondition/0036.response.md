Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `_` is a placeholder variable incremented by 1.
- `n` and `k` are the first and second integers in the input line, respectively.
- If `n` is equal to `k`, the current values of `n` and `k` remain equal.
- If `n` is not equal to `k`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` or `n + 2 <= k * 2` holds, depending on the values of `n` and `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement will output the value of the expression `n - k + 1`.
- The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Determining the Output:
1. **If `n` is equal to `k`**:
   - The expression `n - k + 1` simplifies to `0 + 1`, which is `1`.
   - Therefore, the output will be `1`.

2. **If `n` is not equal to `k`**:
   - The condition `n + 2 > k * 2` or `n + 2 <= k * 2` must hold.
   - Let's analyze both conditions:
     - **Condition `n + 2 > k * 2`**:
       - This can be rewritten as `n + 2 > 2k`, which simplifies to `n > 2k - 2`.
       - The expression `n - k + 1` will be a positive integer greater than 1.
     - **Condition `n + 2 <= k * 2`**:
       - This can be rewritten as `n + 2 <= 2k`, which simplifies to `n <= 2k - 2`.
       - The expression `n - k + 1` will be a non-positive integer (0 or negative).

### Conclusion:
- If `n` is equal to `k`, the output will be `1`.
- If `n` is not equal to `k`:
  - If `n > 2k - 2`, the output will be a positive integer greater than 1.
  - If `n <= 2k - 2`, the output will be a non-positive integer (0 or negative).

### Final Output:
Output: **1 (if n is equal to k) or n - k + 1 (where n and k are the first and second integers in the input line, respectively, and n - k + 1 is a positive integer greater than 1 if n > 2k - 2, or a non-positive integer if n <= 2k - 2)**
