The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `costs`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n >= k`, where `n` is the number of elements in `rows` and `costs` (since `rows` has `n` lists and `costs` has `n` elements).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. Since `i` is now 2, `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= k`, `i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers, `costs` is a list of `n` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`, `total_costs` is a list containing two elements, where the first element is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the second element is the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1` of `costs`.**
