Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string.**

Explanation:
- The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list of characters from the input string.
- The initial state variables `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, maintaining their original constraints and values.
- The input string is converted to a list of characters, and this list is stored in `a`.
