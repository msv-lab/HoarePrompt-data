Output State: **`input` is a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read by `sys.stdin`, `index` is 0, `t` must have been greater than 0 initially, `results` is a list containing all the values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration, `result` is the last value in `results`, `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]` and also the integer value of the string at `data[5 + 2 * n]`, `data[5 + 4 * n]`, and so on, `k` is the integer value of the string at `data[2]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 1]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 1]`, and so on, `PB` is the integer value of the string at `data[3]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 2]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 2]`, and so on, `PS` is the integer value of the string at `data[4]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 3]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 3]`, and so on, `p` and `a` are lists of integers from the strings at the corresponding positions in `data` for each iteration.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The `input` variable still refers to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`.
- The `data` variable remains a list of strings that were split from the input read by `sys.stdin`.
- The `index` variable is still 0.
- The `t` variable must have been greater than 0 initially.
- The `results` list now contains all the values that were returned by the function `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration of the loop.
- The `result` variable holds the last value that was returned by `func_1` and printed during the last iteration of the loop.
- The `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` variables are still derived from the corresponding positions in the `data` list as described in the initial state, but they have been used to compute the results for all iterations.
