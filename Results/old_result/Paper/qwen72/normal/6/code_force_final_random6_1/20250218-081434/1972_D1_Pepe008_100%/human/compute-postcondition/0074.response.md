Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 0, `i` is `b + 2`, `x` is `(a - i * (b + 1)) // i`, `suma` is `suma + (a - i * (b + 1)) // i + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `suma += 1` increments the value of `suma` by 1.
- The initial value of `suma` is `suma + (a - i * (b + 1)) // i`.
- After the increment, `suma` becomes `suma + (a - i * (b + 1)) // i + 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged.
