The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and it is constrained to the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. Each inner list in `cases` contains an integer `n` followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, where `n` is the number of books and each `a_i` represents the number of pages in the i-th book. The constraints for `n` are 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and for each `a_i`, the constraint is 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function returns the sum of the number of pages in all the books.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `cases`. Each inner list contains an integer `n` followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, representing the number of pages in each of `n` books. The function returns a list of sums, where each sum is the total number of pages for the books in the corresponding test case.**
