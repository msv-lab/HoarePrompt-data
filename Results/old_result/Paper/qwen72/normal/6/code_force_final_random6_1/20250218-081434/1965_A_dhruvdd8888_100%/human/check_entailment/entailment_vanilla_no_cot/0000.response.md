Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Function Call**: The program calls `func_1()` inside the loop that reads the number of test cases, but it should be inside the loop that processes each test case. The function call should be placed inside the loop that iterates `t` times.

2. **Incorrect Use of Set**: The program converts the input list of pile sizes to a set, which removes duplicate values. This is incorrect because the number of piles and their sizes are important for determining the winner. The set operation should be removed.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner**: The logic for determining the winner is flawed. The program should check if the number of piles with an odd number of stones is odd or even. If the number of odd piles is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. The current logic does not correctly handle this.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    odd_count = sum(1 for x in nums if x % 2 == 1)
    if odd_count % 2 == 1:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        print('Bob')

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
2. **Counting Odd Piles**: For each test case, it reads the number of piles `N` and the list of pile sizes `nums`. It then counts the number of piles with an odd number of stones.
3. **Determining the Winner**: If the count of odd piles is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. This is based on the observation that the game is essentially a Nim game where the piles are reduced by the same amount each turn, and the parity of the number of odd piles determines the winner.

This corrected program should work correctly for the given problem description.
