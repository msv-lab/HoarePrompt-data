Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise `flag` is False, `ans` is 0, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0, and `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value (which is `Decimal('Infinity')`) and `cnt` (which is 0). Since 0 is less than `Decimal('Infinity')`, `ans` is now 0.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `arr`, `flag`, `val`, `cnt`, and the condition `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`) remain unchanged.
