The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop's continuation is dependent on whether `i` is less than `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `int(input())` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`i` is 1, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `s` is the input string, `a` is the integer value of the first word in the input string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in the input string `s`**
