Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros with `ans[0]` now equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` now equal to `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`, and `ans[n]` is updated to `arr[n-1] + ans[n-1]`. If `ans[n]` is less than `arr[n-1]`, then `ans[1]` is updated to the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[1]` that can be expressed as a sum of `arr[0] + 1` added multiple times to `3 * arr[0] + 2`, and all other elements in `ans` remain unchanged. `i` is `n - 2`, and `ans[i + 1]` is now equal to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`.**
