You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Output

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads a series of input lines, where each line contains two integers `a` and `b`. After reading the specified number of lines, it checks the sum of the last pair of integers (`a` and `b`). If the sum is even, it prints "bob". If the sum is odd, it prints "alice". The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet.
   - After deciding whether to swap, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., whose wallet is empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Play:**
   - If both players play optimally, the key to determining the winner is the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, the player who starts (Alice) will always win because she can always force Bob into a position where he has to make the last move with an even total.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will always win because he can always force Alice into a position where she has to make the last move with an odd total.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
   - It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "alice".

4. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the output for each test case. It only prints the result for the last test case because the `if` statement is outside the loop.
   - The output format is incorrect. It should print "Alice" or "Bob" without extra spaces.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a, b = map(int, s.split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect because it only prints the result for the last test case and has an incorrect output format.
- The corrected program correctly handles each test case and prints the result in the correct format.

**Correctness: **False****

The original program does not correctly handle the output for each test case and has an incorrect output format. The corrected program should be used instead.
