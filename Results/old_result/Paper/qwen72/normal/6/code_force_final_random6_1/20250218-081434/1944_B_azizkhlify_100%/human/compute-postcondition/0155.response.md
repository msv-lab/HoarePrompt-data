Postcondition: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` is 0 if `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2 for any `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, and each other element at index `a[j] - 1` is the count of occurrences of `a[j]` in the list `a`, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` for `j` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` is incremented by 1, `res` is an empty list, `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` that had a count of 2 in `l` before the loop started, `ur` is 0, `re` is 0, `k` is `2 * k - ul` and the current value of `k` is non-zero, and the current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.**
