Output State: **`x` is now `x - 2**i + 1`, `subseq_lens` is a list containing `[i]`, `mx` is 0, and `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i} \leq x + 1\). Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `x - 2**i + 1`.
- The list `subseq_lens` remains unchanged and still contains `[i]`.
- The variable `mx` remains 0.
- The value of `i` remains the largest integer such that \(2^{i} \leq x + 1\), and `i` is not equal to 0.
