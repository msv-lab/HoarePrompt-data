Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `T` must be greater than 0, `_` is not relevant for the loop to execute, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `lft` is the first n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the last n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `lft` is the first n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the last n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is a list containing the first element of `lft` if the second element of `lft` is equal to the first element of `lft`. Otherwise, `ldb` is an empty list. `rdb` is an empty list. `sng` is a list containing the value `lft[i]` if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list. `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `lft` is the first n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the last n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is a list containing the first element of `lft` if the second element of `lft` is equal to the first element of `lft`. Otherwise, `ldb` is an empty list. `rdb` is an empty list. If `lft[2]` is equal to `lft[1]`, `ldb` is updated to contain `lft[2]`. If `lft[2]` is not equal to `lft[1]` and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` is a list containing the value `lft[2]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list. `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `lft` is the first n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the last n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is a list containing the first element of `lft` if the second element of `lft` is equal to the first element of `lft`. Otherwise, `ldb` is an empty list. `rdb` is an empty list. If `lft[2]` is equal to `lft[1]`, `ldb` is updated to contain `lft[2]`. If `lft[2]` is not equal to `lft[1]` and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` is a list containing the value `lft[3]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list. `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3. If `lft[3]` is equal to `lft[2]`, `ldb` now contains `lft[3]`. Otherwise, `sng` contains `lft[3]` if `lft[2]` is not equal to `lft[1]` and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
