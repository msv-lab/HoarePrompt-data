Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a new input string, `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, `i` is the index just past the last character of the last 3-character substring checked, which is `len(a) - 2` or less, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is updated to a new input string.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `ans`, `i`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `a` is provided by the `input()` function, and it replaces the previous value of `a`.
- The condition for `_` being incremented by 1 and being less than the value provided by `int(input())` remains valid.
