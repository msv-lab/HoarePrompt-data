Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `c` is 0, `x` is 0, and `a` is equal to `b`. Additionally, the element at index `x` in the list `l` is greater than `b`.**
