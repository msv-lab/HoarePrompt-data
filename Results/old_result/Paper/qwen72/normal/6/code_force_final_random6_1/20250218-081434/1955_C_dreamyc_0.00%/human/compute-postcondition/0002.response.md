To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to ensure that both conditions in the loop head are met:
1. `k` must be a positive integer.
2. The length of `nums` must be at least 2.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15.
- `nums` is a deque containing `n` positive integers where 1 <= `nums[i]` <= 10^9.
- `ans` is 0.

Let's analyze the conditions:
- `k` is already a positive integer, so this condition is already satisfied.
- `len(nums)` is `n`, and since `n` is a positive integer and 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `len(nums)` is at least 1. However, for the loop to execute, `len(nums)` must be at least 2.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute the first time. Since `n` is the length of `nums`, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `nums` contains at least 2 elements.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing `n` positive integers where 1 <= `nums[i]` <= 10^9, `ans` is 0, and `n` must be at least 2**.
