Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr) and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is updated to [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0, 0].**

Explanation: The code snippet `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` updates the first element of `max_segment` by adding `arr[i]` to it. Since `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is `arr[1]`. The initial value of `max_segment[0]` is `arr[0]`, so after the update, `max_segment[0]` becomes `arr[0] + arr[1]`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
