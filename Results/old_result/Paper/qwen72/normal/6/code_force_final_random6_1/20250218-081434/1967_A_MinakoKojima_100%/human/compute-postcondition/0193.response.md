Postcondition: **`_` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`. If `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is `ans + dif`, `k` is `k - dif * 3`, and if `dif` is 0, `res` is `res - 2`; otherwise, `res` is `res - 1`. If `k < dif * (i + 1)`, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, and `res` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
