Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a set of integers, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, `k` is an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = {*R()}` transforms the list `a` into a set of integers. The specific values of the integers in the set are not provided, but the variable `a` now holds a set of integers instead of a list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `k`) remain unchanged.
