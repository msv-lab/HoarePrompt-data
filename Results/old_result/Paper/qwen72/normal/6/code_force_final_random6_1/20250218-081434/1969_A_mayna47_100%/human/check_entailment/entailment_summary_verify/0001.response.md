### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - It reads the number of friends `n`.
   - It initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` with zeros.
   - It then reads the list of best friends and appends it to `v` starting from index 1. This is done to align the indices with the friend numbers.

3. **Checking for Mutual Best Friends:**
   - The program iterates through each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - It checks if `v[v[i]] == i`, which means if the best friend of `v[i]` is `i`. This condition indicates that friends `i` and `v[i]` are mutual best friends.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns immediately. This is the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

4. **Default Case:**
   - If no mutual best friends are found, the program prints `3`. This is based on the assumption that if there are no mutual best friends, the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness for Mutual Best Friends:**
  - The program correctly identifies pairs of mutual best friends and prints `2` when such a pair is found. This is the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

- **Correctness for No Mutual Best Friends:**
  - The program prints `3` if no mutual best friends are found. However, this is not always correct. For example, consider the case where `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`:
    - Inviting friends 1 and 2 will ensure that both come to the party, as friend 1's best friend is 2 and friend 2's best friend is 3, and friend 3's best friend is 4, and friend 4's best friend is 1. This forms a cycle where inviting any two friends in the cycle will ensure both come to the party.
    - The correct answer should be `2` in this case, not `3`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where there are no mutual best friends but it is still possible to invite fewer than 3 friends to ensure at least 2 come to the party. Specifically, it fails to consider cycles in the best friend relationships.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
