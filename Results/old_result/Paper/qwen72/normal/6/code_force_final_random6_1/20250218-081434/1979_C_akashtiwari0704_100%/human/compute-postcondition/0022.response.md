Output State: **`bets` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is increased by `prod // a[0]` + `a[1]`, `a[1]` is updated to `prod // a[1]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `sumo` is increased by `int(a[i])`, where `i` is 1.
- Since `a[1]` is updated to `prod // a[1]` in the initial state, `sumo` is increased by `prod // a[1]`.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `a[0]` remains updated to `prod // a[0]`.
- The value of `a[1]` remains updated to `prod // a[1]`.
- The value of `bets` remains an input integer that must be greater than 1.
