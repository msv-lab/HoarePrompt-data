### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Calls:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and then reads the `n` rows of the river grid.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row to compute the cost of building a bridge on that row.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for computing the minimum cost of installing supports on a single row.
   - It starts by setting the cost of the first support to 1 and then iterates over the first `d` cells, increasing the cost of each support by 2.
   - A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost of supports within the sliding window of size `d + 2`.
   - For each cell from `d` to the end of the row, it updates the cost of the support by adding the minimum cost from the heap and 1.
   - The function returns the cost of the last support, which is the total cost of building the bridge on that row.

3. **Function `func_2` Logic:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input for a single test case and computes the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then computes the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, ensuring that `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are within the specified ranges.
   - The program correctly initializes the first and last elements of each row to 0, as required by the problem statement.
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the minimum cost of supports within the sliding window is efficiently found and updated.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs the minimum total cost of building `k` consecutive bridges for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the input, processes each row to compute the cost of building a bridge, and then finds the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges. The use of a min-heap ensures that the sliding window constraints are met efficiently.

### Correctness:
**True**
