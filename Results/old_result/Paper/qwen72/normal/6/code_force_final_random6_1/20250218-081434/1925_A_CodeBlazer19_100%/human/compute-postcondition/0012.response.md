Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user, where `1 <= n <= 26` and `1 <= k <= 26`. It then prints a string consisting of the first `k` letters of the English alphabet repeated `n` times. After completing all `t` iterations, the function ends, and the state is that `t` iterations have been performed, with the final values of `n` and `k` being the inputs from the last test case. **
