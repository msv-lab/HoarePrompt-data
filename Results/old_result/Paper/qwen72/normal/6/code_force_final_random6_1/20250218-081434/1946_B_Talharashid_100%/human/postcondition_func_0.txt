The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of an array `n` and the number of operations `k`, followed by the array `a` of `n` integers. It calculates the maximum sum of contiguous non-negative elements in the array `a` before any negative element resets the sum to 0. The function then computes and prints the result of the expression `(2
