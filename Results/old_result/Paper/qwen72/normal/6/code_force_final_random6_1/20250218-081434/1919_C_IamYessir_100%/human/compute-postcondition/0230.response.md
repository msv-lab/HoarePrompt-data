Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element. If `b[i]` > `b[i - 1]`, `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.***
