Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is `k // 2 - 1` if `u` is `False` and `v` is `True`, otherwise `n` is `k // 2 + 1` if `u` is `True` and `v` is `True`, otherwise `n` is `k // 2`, `a` is a set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, `k` must be at least 1, `b` is a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `f` is 1 if `k + 1` is in `a` or `b` and either `k + 2` is in `a` or `b`, otherwise `f` is 0, `m` is `k // 2 - 1` if `k + 1` is in `a` and not in `b` and `u` is `True` and `v` is `False`, otherwise `m` is `k // 2 - 1` if `k + 1` is in `a` and not in `b` and `u` is `False` and `v` is `False`, otherwise `m` is `k // 2` if `k + 1` is in `a` and not in `b` and `u` is `False` and `v` is `True`, otherwise `m` is `k // 2` if `k + 1` is in `a` and not in `b` and `u` is `True` and `v` is `True`, `i` is `k + 3`, `u` is `True` if `k + 3` is in `a`, otherwise `u` is `False`, `v` is `True` if `k + 3` is in `b`, otherwise `v` is `False`**.
