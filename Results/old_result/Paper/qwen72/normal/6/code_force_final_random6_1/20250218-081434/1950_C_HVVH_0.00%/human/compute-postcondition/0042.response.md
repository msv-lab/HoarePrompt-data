Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 2.
- `h` and `m` are integers derived from the input string `s`.
- If `h` is 0, `h` is updated to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'.
- If `h` > 12, `h` is updated to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'.
- If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'AM'.
- Otherwise, `day` remains 'PM'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Extract `h` and `m` from `s`:**
   - The string `s` is in the format "hh:mm". For example, if `s` is "14:30", then `h` is 14 and `m` is 30.

2. **Determine the value of `h` and `day` based on the conditions:**
   - If `h` is 0, it is updated to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'.
   - If `h` > 12, it is updated to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'AM'.
   - Otherwise, `day` remains 'PM'.

3. **Format the output:**
   - The `print` statement will format `h` and `m` as two-digit numbers and print them along with the value of `day`.

### Example Scenarios:
- **If `s` is "14:30":**
  - `h` is 14.
  - Since `h` > 12, `h` is updated to `14 - 12 = 2` and `day` is set to 'PM'.
  - The output will be "02:30 PM".

- **If `s` is "00:15":**
  - `h` is 0.
  - Since `h` is 0, `h` is updated to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'.
  - The output will be "12:15 AM".

- **If `s` is "12:45":**
  - `h` is 12.
  - Since `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'AM'.
  - The output will be "12:45 AM".

- **If `s` is "07:20":**
  - `h` is 7.
  - Since `h` is not 0, not greater than 12, and not 12, `day` remains 'PM'.
  - The output will be "07:20 PM".

### General Output:
Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be in the format "hh:mm AM/PM" where:
- `hh` is the hour in 12-hour format.
- `mm` is the minute.
- `AM/PM` is determined based on the conditions provided.

Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day} (where h is the hour in 12-hour format derived from the input string s, m is the minute derived from the input string s, and day is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions provided)**
