Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 0, `ii` is `n-2`, `ck` is 1, `r` is `r+1`, `t` is greater than `r+1`, `f` is 1, `j` is the index where the first inequality is found if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n-2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of the list `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the list `num`, `symb2` is the last element of the list `num`. If all elements in `num` from index 0 to `n-2` are equal to their next element, `cn` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `cn` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list that are equal to their next element, and the loop breaks at the first inequality.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(n - 1):
    if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
        ck += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `ii` is 0, `r` is `r+1`, `t` is greater than `r+1`, `f` is 1, `j` is the index where the first inequality is found if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n-2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of the list `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the list `num`, `symb2` is the last element of the list `num`, `cn` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list that are equal to their next element, and the loop breaks at the first inequality if any. If `onum[0] == onum[1]`, then `ck` is 2. Otherwise, `ck` is 1 and the loop breaks.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 2, `ii` is 1, `r` is `r+1`, `t` is greater than `r+1`, `f` is 1, `j` is the index where the first inequality is found if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n-2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of the list `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the list `num`, `symb2` is the last element of the list `num`, `cn` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list that are equal to their next element, and the loop breaks at the first inequality if any, `ck` is 3 if `onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]`, otherwise `ck` is 2 if `onum[0] == onum[1]`, and `ck` is 1 if neither condition is met and the loop breaks.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 3, `ii` is 2, `r` is `r+1`, `t` is greater than `r+1`, `f` is 1, `j` is the index where the first inequality is found if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n-2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of the list `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the list `num`, `symb2` is the last element of the list `num`, `cn` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list that are equal to their next element, and the loop breaks at the first inequality if any. If `onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]`, `ck` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ck` is 3 if `onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]` (which is not the case here), 2 if `onum[0] == onum[1]`, and 1 if neither condition is met and the loop breaks.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
