Output State: **`remainder_steps` must be greater than 1, `score` is increased by the value of `a[p[current_pos - 1] - 1]`, `current_pos` is now equal to `p[current_pos - 1]`**

The value of `current_pos` is updated to be equal to `p[current_pos - 1]`. The conditions that `remainder_steps` must be greater than 1 and that `score` is increased by the value of `a[p[current_pos - 1] - 1]` remain unchanged.
