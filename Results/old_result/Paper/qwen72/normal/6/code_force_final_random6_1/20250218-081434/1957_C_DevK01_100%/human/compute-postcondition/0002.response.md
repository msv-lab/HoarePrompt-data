The code snippet updates the list `dp` by appending a new element to it. This new element is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`. Given the initial state, `dp` is a list with two elements, both equal to 1, and `i` is 2. Let's calculate the new element:

1. `dp[-1]` is the last element of `dp`, which is 1.
2. `dp[-2]` is the second last element of `dp`, which is also 1.
3. `i` is 2, so `i - 1` is 1.
4. The expression `2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]` becomes `2 * 1 * 1`, which is 2.
5. Adding `dp[-1]` to this result gives `1 + 2`, which is 3.
6. The modulus operation `3 % (7 + 10 ** 9)` simplifies to `3 % 1000000007`, which is 3.

Therefore, the new element appended to `dp` is 3. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `dp` is a list with three elements: [1, 1, 3]**
