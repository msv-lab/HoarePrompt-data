To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if the range `1` to `n + 1` is valid, which means `n` must be at least 1. However, since `n` is already given to be in the range `2 <= n <= 10^3`, it is guaranteed to be at least 1. 

The variable `i` is the loop iterator, and it will start from 1 and go up to `n`. The initial state provided is `i` is `n`, which is incorrect for the loop to start. The loop should start with `i` being 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `i` starts at 1 and `n` is within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 47, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is 1**
