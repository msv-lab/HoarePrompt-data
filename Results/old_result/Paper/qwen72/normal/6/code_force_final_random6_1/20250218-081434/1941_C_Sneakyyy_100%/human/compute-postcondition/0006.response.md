Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `0` and ending at index `2` (inclusive), `a` is an input string with length greater than 2, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to be the substring of `a` starting from index `0` and ending at index `2` (inclusive).
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
