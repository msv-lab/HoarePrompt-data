The only variables in the loop head are `tickets_bought` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `tickets_bought` and `k`. If `tickets_bought` is less than `k`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `tickets_bought` is 0, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). Since `tickets_bought` is 0, the loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than 0.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. `pq` is now a heap containing the same tuples as before, but they are now organized in a heap structure for efficient retrieval of the smallest element. `total_cost` is 0. `tickets_bought` is 0. `price_increase` is 0.**
