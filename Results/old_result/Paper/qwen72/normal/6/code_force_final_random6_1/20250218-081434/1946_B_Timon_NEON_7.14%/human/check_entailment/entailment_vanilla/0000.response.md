### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` integers.
   - We need to perform exactly `k` operations where in each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray, compute its sum, and insert this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations.
   - The final answer should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function simply returns the modulo of a given number with \(10^9 + 7\).
     - This is a correct and straightforward implementation.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
     - However, the function has several issues:
       - It does not correctly handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers.
       - The logic for updating `segments_variants` and `max_segment` is flawed. For example, it does not properly reset `max_segment` when a new segment starts.
       - The function returns a segment with a sum of \(-1\) if no valid segment is found, which is incorrect for the problem's requirements.

   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
     - This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operations.
     - It is supposed to compute the final answer based on the maximum segment sum and the number of operations, but it is not implemented.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations, we need to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - If the maximum sum is positive, we can repeatedly insert this sum into the array to maximize the total sum.
   - If the maximum sum is negative or zero, the best we can do is to insert an empty subarray (sum = 0) or the maximum sum subarray itself, depending on the values in the array.

4. **Expected Implementation:**
   - Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - If the maximum sum is positive, the final sum after `k` operations will be the initial sum of the array plus the maximum sum multiplied by `k`.
   - If the maximum sum is non-positive, the final sum will be the initial sum of the array.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because:
- **Function 2** does not correctly find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
- **Function 3** is incomplete and does not perform the required operations.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
