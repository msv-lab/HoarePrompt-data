Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros with `ans[0]` now equal to `arr[0] + 1` and `ans[1]` now equal to `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`, `i` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans[1]` is updated to `arr[0] + ans[0]`.
- Since `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` becomes `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`, which simplifies to `2 * arr[0] + 1`.
- The values of `arr`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The rest of the list `ans` remains a list of `n` zeros, except for the first two elements.
