Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a "STAIR," "PEAK," or "NONE" based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `q` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Condition Checking**:
   - It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a "STAIR."
   - It checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a "PEAK."
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE."
3. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case as specified in the problem description.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program works as expected and produces the correct results. Therefore, the program is correct.
