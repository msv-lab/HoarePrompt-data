Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 0, `i` is 0, `values[0]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `values[i] = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to the first element of the `values` list. Since `i` is 0, `values[0]` is now 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
