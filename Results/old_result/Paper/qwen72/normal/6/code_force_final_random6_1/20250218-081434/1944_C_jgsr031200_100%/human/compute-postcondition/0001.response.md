The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, the list `arr` must have at least one element. The variable `i` will take the value of the first element in `arr` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where 0 <= `arr[i]` < len(`arr`) for all i, and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5) and `arr` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros**
