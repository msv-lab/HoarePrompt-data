Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string with length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and of length 3, `ans` is 1 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is 3, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1. `len(a)` must be greater than 5 if `i` is 3, or greater than 3 if `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `s = a[i:i + 3]` updates the value of `s` to be the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and of length 3.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The value of `s` is now the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and of length 3.
- The conditions for `ans` and `i` remain the same: `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.
- The condition that `len(a)` must be greater than 5 if `i` is 3, or greater than 3 if `i` is 1, remains valid.
