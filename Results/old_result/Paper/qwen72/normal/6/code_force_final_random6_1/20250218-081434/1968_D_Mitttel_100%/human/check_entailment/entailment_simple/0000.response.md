### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the inputs for each test case.
   - It adjusts the starting positions `pb` and `ps` to be 0-indexed by subtracting 1, which is necessary because Python lists are 0-indexed.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the game for a single player starting from position `s` for `k` turns.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score the player can achieve.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current score of the player.
   - It initializes `vis` to a list of zeros, which will keep track of visited positions to avoid infinite loops in the permutation.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as the current position `s` has not been visited and there are still turns left (`k > 0`).
   - Inside the loop:
     - The current position `s` is marked as visited.
     - The maximum score `mx` is updated to the maximum of the current `mx` and the potential score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns (`cur + k * a[s]`).
     - The current score `cur` is increased by the score at the current position `a[s]`.
     - The number of turns `k` is decremented.
     - The player moves to the next position `p[s]`.

4. **Loop Termination:**
   - The loop terminates when either the position `s` has been visited before (indicating a cycle in the permutation) or when there are no more turns left (`k == 0`).
   - The function returns the maximum score `mx` calculated during the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - The main program calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha, compares their scores, and prints the result accordingly.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Adjustment of `a` and `p`:**
  - The program incorrectly subtracts 1 from each element in `a` and `p` in the loop:
    ```python
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1
        a[i] -= 1
    ```
  - This adjustment is unnecessary and incorrect. The elements of `p` should remain as they are (1-indexed values), and the elements of `a` should also remain as they are (positive integers representing scores).

### Corrected Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1  # Adjust p to be 0-indexed
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        
        cur += a[s]
        
        k -= 1
        
        s = p[s]
        
    return mx
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected as described above.
- **False** if the program remains as provided, due to the incorrect adjustment of `a` and `p`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (due to the incorrect adjustment of `a` and `p`).
