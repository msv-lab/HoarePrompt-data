Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets `cnt` to 0.
- The initial state specifies that `cnt` can be 0 or 1, but after the code is executed, `cnt` is explicitly set to 0.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `arr`, `flag`, `val`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans` is still the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`, but since `cnt` is now 0, `ans` will be 0 if the previous `ans` was greater than 0. If the previous `ans` was already 0, `ans` remains 0.
