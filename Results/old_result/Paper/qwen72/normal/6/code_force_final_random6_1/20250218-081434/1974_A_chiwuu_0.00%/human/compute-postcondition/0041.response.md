Output State: **`t` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the first input string, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `b`, and `t1` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a = int(a)` converts `a` from its initial state (which is already the integer value of the first input string) to an integer.
- Since `a` is already an integer, this operation does not change its value.
- The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `b`, and `t1` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
