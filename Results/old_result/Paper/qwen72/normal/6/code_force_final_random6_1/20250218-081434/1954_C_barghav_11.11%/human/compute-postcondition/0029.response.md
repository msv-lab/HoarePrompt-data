Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `i` is 2, `n` is the minimum of `a[2]` and `b[2]`, and `m` is the maximum of `a[2]` and `b[2]`.** 

The value of `n` is updated to the minimum of `a[2]` and `b[2]`. The value of `m` remains the maximum of `a[2]` and `b[2]`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged.
