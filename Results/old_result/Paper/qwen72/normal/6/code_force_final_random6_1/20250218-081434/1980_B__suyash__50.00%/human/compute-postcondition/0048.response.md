Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` that must have at least 2 elements. If `fav` is not equal to `l[1]` and `k` is less than or equal to 0 after the update `k = k - dic[l[1]]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `fav` is not equal to `l[1]` and `k` is greater than 0 after the update, `k` is updated to `k - dic[l[1]]` and the program continues. If `fav` is equal to `l[1]`, `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[1]]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
