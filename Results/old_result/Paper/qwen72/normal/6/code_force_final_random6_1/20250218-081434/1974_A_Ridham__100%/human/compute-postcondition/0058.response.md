The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output for each case is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99). The function returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
