Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `l` is 0, 1, or 2, `r` is n - 1, n - 2, or n - 3, and `sunks` is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `k >= 2 * a[l]`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[l]`, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l]`, `l` is 1 or 2, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2, and `sunks` is 1, 2, or 3. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is updated to n - 2 or n - 3, and `sunks` is 2, 3, or 4. If `l` == `r`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k < 2 * a[l]` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, then `sunks` is 1, 2, or 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sunks` remains 0, 1, or 2, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
