### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires us to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
     - Both strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
     - String `c` does not match the template `t`.
   - A string `s` matches the template `t` if:
     - For each position `i`, if `t[i]` is lowercase, `s[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`.
     - For each position `i`, if `t[i]` is uppercase, `s[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

2. **Function 1 Analysis (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (length of the strings), `a`, `b`, and `c` (the strings themselves).
   - It iterates over each position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each position `i`, it checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - If such a position is found, it returns 'YES'.
   - If no such position is found, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Function 2 Analysis (`func_2`):**
   - The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` and calls `func_1` with these parameters.
   - It collects the results of each test case in a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the list.

4. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if there exists a position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - If such a position exists, it is possible to construct a template `t` where `t[i]` is an uppercase letter that is different from the lowercase version of `c[i]`, and both `a` and `b` will match this template while `c` will not.
   - However, the function does not explicitly check if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same for all positions. This is a critical oversight because if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same for all positions, it is impossible to construct a template `t` that both `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.
   - For example, if `a = "abc"`, `b = "abc"`, and `c = "def"`, the function will return 'NO' because there is no position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, the correct answer should be 'YES' because we can construct a template `t = "ABC"` where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

5. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - It prints the results in the correct order.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because `func_1` does not handle the case where `a` and `b` are the same for all positions. This oversight can lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

Final: **False**
