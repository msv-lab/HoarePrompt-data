Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. The program iterates through each test case, reads the array, and then calculates the minimum number of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element of the array. If the array has only one element or if all elements are the same, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum length of such consecutive subarrays.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Consecutive Elements**:
   - The program calculates the minimum length of consecutive subarrays where all elements are equal to the first element of the array. This approach is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of making the array non-beautiful by removing elements that are not part of these subarrays.
   - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will find the minimum length of consecutive `1`s, which is 1. However, removing a single `1` does not necessarily make the array non-beautiful. The correct approach should be to identify the minimum number of elements to remove to break the condition that allows the array to be beautiful.

2. **Handling of All Elements Being the Same**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where all elements are the same by outputting `-1` if `ans == n`. This is because an array with all elements the same will always remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n == 1` by outputting `-1`, as a single-element array is trivially beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

4. **General Logic**:
   - The logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is incorrect. The program should instead look for the minimum number of elements to remove to break the condition that allows the array to be beautiful. This involves finding the smallest subarray that can be removed to ensure that no valid `i` (where `2 <= i <= n-1` and `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`) exists.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
