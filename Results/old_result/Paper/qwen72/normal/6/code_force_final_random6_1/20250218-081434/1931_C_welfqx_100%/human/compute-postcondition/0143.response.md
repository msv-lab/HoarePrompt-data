Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 2, `ii` is `n-2`, `ck` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `onum` that are equal up to the point where the elements are no longer equal or the end of the list is reached, `r` is `r+1`, `t` is greater than `r+1`, `f` is 1 if `num[j]` equals `num[j + 1]`, otherwise `f` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `j` is 2, and all other variables (`t`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `cn`) remain unchanged.***
