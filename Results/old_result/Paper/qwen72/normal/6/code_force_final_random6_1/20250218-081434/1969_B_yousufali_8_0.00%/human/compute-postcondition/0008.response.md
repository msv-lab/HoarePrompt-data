The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It assumes that the `input()` function will provide a valid integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function calls `func_1()` to handle the processing. The function does not return any value.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the input, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and processes `t` test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case. The function does not return any value.**
