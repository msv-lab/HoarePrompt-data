Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros with `ans[0]` now equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` now equal to `arr[1]`, and `ans[i + 1]` now equal to `arr[i + 1]` for all `i` such that `1 <= i < n - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, and the current value of `ans[i + 1]` is equal to or greater than `arr[i + 1]`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The list `arr` remains unchanged.
- The integer `n` remains unchanged.
- The list `ans` initially had `n` zeros, but after the loop executes, `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`.
- The value of `ans[1]` is incremented by `ans[0]` until it is equal to or greater than `arr[1]`.
- For each subsequent index `i + 1` (starting from `i = 1`), `ans[i + 1]` is incremented by `ans[i]` until it is equal to or greater than `arr[i + 1]`.
- The loop continues until `i` reaches `n - 2`, and at this point, `ans[i + 1]` (which is `ans[n - 1]`) is equal to or greater than `arr[i + 1]` (which is `arr[n - 1]`).
- The loop terminates when `ans[i + 1]` is no longer less than `arr[i + 1]` for the current `i`.
