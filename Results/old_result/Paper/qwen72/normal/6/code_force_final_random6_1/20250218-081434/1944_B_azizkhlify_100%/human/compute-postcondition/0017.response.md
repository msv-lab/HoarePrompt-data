The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is `n + 1`, the index `a[i] - 1` is `a[n + 1] - 1`. The value at this index in the list `r` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**
