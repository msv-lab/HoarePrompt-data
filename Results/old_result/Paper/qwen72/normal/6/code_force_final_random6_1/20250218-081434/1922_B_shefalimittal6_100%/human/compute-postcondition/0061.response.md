Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 6`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `n` must be greater than 1, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `v[x]` incremented by 2, `cnt` is 0, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the total number of pairs and triplets of indices where the values in `data` are the same, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx]`.** 

The value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now `n + 6`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
