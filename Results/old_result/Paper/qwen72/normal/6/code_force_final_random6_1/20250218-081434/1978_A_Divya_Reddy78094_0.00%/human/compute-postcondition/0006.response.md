The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented by 1, so `_` will be 1, and `t` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
