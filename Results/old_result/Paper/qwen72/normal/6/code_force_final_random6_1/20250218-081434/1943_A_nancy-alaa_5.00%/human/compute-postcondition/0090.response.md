Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `first` is True.
- If `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- Otherwise, the program continues without modifying `n` or `i`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is explicitly set to 1.
2. **Conditions and Loops**: The initial state mentions that if `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, the code snippet provided does not include any loops or if statements. It only contains a `print` statement.
3. **Output**: The `print` statement will simply print the value of `i`, which is 1.

### Conclusion:
The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
