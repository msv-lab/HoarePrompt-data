Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list and its first element is no longer 0, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `res` is 0**

The first element of the list `a` has been removed, so its first element is no longer 0. The length of `a` has decreased by 1, so `i` is now `len(a) - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
