Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `T` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` and `b` are input integers.
   - If `a` is equal to `b`, the relationship between `a` and `b` remains unchanged.
   - If `a` is not equal to `b`:
     - If `a` is 1, `a` remains 1.
     - If `a` is not 1, `a` retains its value and parity (odd or even).
     - If `b` is 1, `b` remains 1.
     - If `b` is not 1, `b` retains its value and parity (odd or even).
     - The relationship between `a` and `b` (whether `a` is greater than, less than, or equal to `b`) remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('Bob')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'Bob'`.
   - The initial state provides information about the variables `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the `print` statement will execute independently of the initial state.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The `print` statement will print the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
