Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, but it does not consider the possibility of cutting the rectangle along the `a` dimension or the combined dimensions of the resulting rectangles. For example, consider the input `3 2`:

- According to the problem description, a 3x2 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x2 rectangle.
- However, the program will output "no" because it only checks if `b` is even, and `2 % 2 == 0` is true, but it does not check if `a` is even or if the resulting rectangles can form a different rectangle.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
