Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^6, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    ans = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(a) - 2:
        s = a[i:i + 3]
        if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
            i += 3
            ans += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, and `i` is the length of `a` minus 2 or the index just after the last processed character that was part of a 'map' or 'pie' substring.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, and `i` is the index just past the last character of the last 3-character substring checked, which is `len(a) - 2` or less.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a new input string, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`, `i` is `len(a) - 2` or `len(a) - 1`, and `ans` is the total number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
