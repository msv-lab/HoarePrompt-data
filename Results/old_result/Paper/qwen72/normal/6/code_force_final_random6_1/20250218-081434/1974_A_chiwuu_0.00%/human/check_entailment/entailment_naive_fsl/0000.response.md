Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 1x1 icons (a) is exactly 15 and the number of 2x2 icons (b) is 0. According to the problem description, if there are exactly 15 1x1 icons and no 2x2 icons, only one screen is needed. However, the program will incorrectly output 2 screens in this case.

Here is the specific input that causes the issue:
```
1
15 0
```

The program will output:
```
2
```

But the expected output should be:
```
1
```
