Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is unchanged, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element), `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is the smallest even number that is greater than or equal to `k` or the total number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller, `elem` is the last element in `ldb` that was processed before the loop broke or finished, `_` is `T`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`i`**: Remains `n - 1` as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`ldb`**: Contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element. The loop processes elements from `ldb`, but does not modify `ldb` itself.
- **`sng`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`k`**: Remains unchanged as it is only used for comparison in the loop.
- **`lst`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`lft`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`rgt`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`sz`**: This variable is incremented by 2 for each iteration of the loop. The loop will continue to add 2 to `sz` until `sz` is greater than or equal to `k` or until all elements in `ldb` have been processed. Therefore, `sz` will be the smallest even number that is greater than or equal to `k` or the total number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller.
- **`elem`**: This variable holds the last element in `ldb` that was processed before the loop broke or finished.
- **`_`**: Remains `T` as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`rdb`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
