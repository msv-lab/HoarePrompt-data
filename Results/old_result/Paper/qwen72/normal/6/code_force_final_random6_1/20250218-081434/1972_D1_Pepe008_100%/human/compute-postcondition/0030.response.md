Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `i` is `b`, `suma` is 0, `info` is a list of strings from the input.**

The code snippet sets `suma` to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged. The initial values of `n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `info` are still valid.
