Correctness: **False**

The given program has a logical flaw in its approach to solving the problem. Specifically, the program only attempts to split the first element that violates the non-decreasing order condition and then checks if the array is sorted. However, this approach is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing after performing the operation any number of times.

### Issues:
1. **Single Split Operation**: The program only performs a single split operation on the first element that violates the non-decreasing order. This is not enough to determine if the array can be made sorted. Multiple elements might need to be split, and the splits might need to be performed in a specific order.

2. **Insertion Logic**: The program inserts the digits of the split element at the same position, but it does not consider the possibility that the digits might need to be inserted at different positions to achieve a sorted array.

3. **Sorting Check**: The function `func_1` checks if the array is sorted after a single split operation, which is insufficient. The array might need multiple operations to become sorted.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to:
- Consider all possible elements that can be split.
- Simulate the splitting process and check if the array can be made non-decreasing.
- Use a more sophisticated algorithm to determine if the array can be sorted after performing the operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(a):
    # Function to split an element into its digits and return the new array
    def split_element(arr, index):
        element = arr[index]
        if element < 10:
            return arr
        digits = [int(d) for d in str(element)]
        return arr[:index] + digits + arr[index+1:]
    
    # Check if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting elements
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] >= 10:
            new_a = split_element(a, i)
            if new_a == sorted(new_a):
                return True
            # Recursively check if further splits can make the array sorted
            if can_be_sorted(new_a):
                return True
    return a == sorted(a)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(a):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Explanation:
1. **`split_element` Function**: This function takes an array and an index, splits the element at that index into its digits, and returns the new array.
2. **`can_be_sorted` Function**: This function checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting elements. It recursively checks all possible splits.
3. **Main Loop**: For each test case, it reads the input, calls `can_be_sorted`, and prints the result.

This approach ensures that all possible splits are considered, and the array is checked for non-decreasing order after each split.
