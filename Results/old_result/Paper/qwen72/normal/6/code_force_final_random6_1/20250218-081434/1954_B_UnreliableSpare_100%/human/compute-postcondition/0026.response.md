The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is `arr[0]`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity'). Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.**
