Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `n` is unchanged.
   - `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element and must have at least three elements.
   - `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element).
   - `k` is unchanged.
   - `lst` is unchanged.
   - `lft` is unchanged.
   - `rgt` is unchanged.
   - `sz` is 4 if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `sz` is 2.
   - `elem` is the third element in `ldb`.
   - `_` is `T`.
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (since `end=' '` is specified).
   - `elem` is defined as the third element in `ldb`.
   - `ldb` is a list that contains elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element and must have at least three elements. This means `ldb` has at least three elements, and `elem` is the third element of this list.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `elem` is the third element in `ldb`, and it will be printed twice, the output will be `elem elem ` (with a trailing space).

Given the initial state, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the third element in the list `ldb`)**
