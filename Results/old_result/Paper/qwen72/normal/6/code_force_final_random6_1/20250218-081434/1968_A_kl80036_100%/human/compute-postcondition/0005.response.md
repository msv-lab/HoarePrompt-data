Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 (input value), `i` is 1, `y` is `x - 1` which is an integer such that 1 <= y <= 999 (based on the new value of `x`).** 

The value of `x` is updated to a new integer input value between 2 and 1000. The value of `y` is recalculated based on the new value of `x`, and it remains an integer between 1 and 999. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
