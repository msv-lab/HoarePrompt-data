Output State: **`min_heap` is a valid min-heap with at least one tuple `(value, index)` where `index <= -1`, `i` is `d + 1`, `row` is a list of elements, and `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.**

The `pass` statement does not change any variables or state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state. The value of `row[i]` is still updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, and `min_heap`, `i`, and `row` retain their initial properties and values.
