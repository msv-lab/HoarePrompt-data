Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= n, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `r` is n - 1, `mid` is (n - 1) // 2, and `array[mid]` is less than `find`.**

Explanation: The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `l` is `mid + 1`, which is `(n - 1) // 2 + 1`. The conditions for `array`, `find`, `n`, `r`, and `array[mid]` are still valid.
