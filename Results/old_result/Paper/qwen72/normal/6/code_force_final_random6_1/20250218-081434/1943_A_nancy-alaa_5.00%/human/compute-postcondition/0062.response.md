The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i]` is 1, the program continues without any changes to `n` or `i`, and `first` is True. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `n` or `i`.**
