Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a list of integers converted from the input provided by the user and sorted in ascending order, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second and third integers in `L`, `k` is the third integer in `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `cost` is either `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m` is equal to `k`, or `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu` if `n * m` is not equal to `k`, where `w` is the last element of the original `N` and `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**

Explanation:
- The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `L` to a new list of integers provided by the user.
- The initial state mentions that `L` was already a list of integers provided by the user, so the only change is that `L` is now a new list of integers provided by the user.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, and `cost` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
