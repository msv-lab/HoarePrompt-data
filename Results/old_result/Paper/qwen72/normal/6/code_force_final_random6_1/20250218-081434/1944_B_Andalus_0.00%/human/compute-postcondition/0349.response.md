Postcondition: ***`sz` is `sz + 1`, `elem` is the second element in `sng`, `rdb` must have at least enough elements to satisfy the condition `sz < k` before the loop breaks, `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0, and `sng` must have at least 2 elements. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
