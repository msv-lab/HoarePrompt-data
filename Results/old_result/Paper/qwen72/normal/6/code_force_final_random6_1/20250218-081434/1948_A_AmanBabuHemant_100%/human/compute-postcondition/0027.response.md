The given `print` statement is:
```
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state describes the value of `t`, `n`, and the string `s`.
- `t` is greater than 0, and it is specifically mentioned that `t` is now `t - 1`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
- The length of `s` is less than 200 if `n` is even and the initial length of `s` was less than 200.
- The length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200 if `n` is even and the initial length of `s` was greater than or equal to 200.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
