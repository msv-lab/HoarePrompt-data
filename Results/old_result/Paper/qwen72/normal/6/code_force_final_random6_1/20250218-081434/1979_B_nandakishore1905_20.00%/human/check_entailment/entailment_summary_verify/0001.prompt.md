You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        k = abs(n - m)
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            print(k - q)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple pairs of integers from the user and prints a value based on the absolute difference between each pair. For each pair `(n, m)`, if the absolute difference `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`. If `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, it prints 1. If `n` is 0 and `m` is even, it prints 2. Otherwise, it prints the difference between `k` and the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input parameters `x` and `y` mentioned in the annotations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given two distinct non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \).
   - We need to find the length of the longest common subsegment of the sequences \( a_n = n \oplus x \) and \( b_n = n \oplus y \).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The sequences \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) are defined by the bitwise XOR operation.
   - The XOR operation has the property that \( a_n = b_n \) if and only if \( n \oplus x = n \oplus y \).
   - This simplifies to \( n \oplus n = x \oplus y \), which means \( x \oplus y \) must be 0 for \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) to be equal. However, since \( x \) and \( y \) are distinct, \( x \oplus y \) is always non-zero.
   - The length of the longest common subsegment is determined by the number of consecutive bits that are the same in \( x \oplus y \).

3. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \) (which correspond to \( x \) and \( y \)).
   - It calculates \( k = |n - m| \), which is not the correct approach. The correct approach should be \( k = n \oplus m \).
   - The program then checks if \( k \) is a power of 2 using the condition \( k \& (k - 1) == 0 \). This is correct because a power of 2 in binary has exactly one bit set to 1.
   - If \( k \) is a power of 2, it prints \( k \), which is the correct length of the longest common subsegment.
   - If \( k \) is not a power of 2, it further checks special cases for \( n = 0 \) and the parity of \( m \):
     - If \( n = 0 \) and \( m \) is odd, it prints 1.
     - If \( n = 0 \) and \( m \) is even, it prints 2.
   - For other cases, it converts \( k \) to its binary representation, calculates the length of the binary string, and then computes \( q = 2^{(p - 1)} \) where \( p \) is the length of the binary string.
   - Finally, it prints \( k - q \).

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly identifies when \( k \) is a power of 2 and prints \( k \).
   - The special cases for \( n = 0 \) and the parity of \( m \) are not necessary and are incorrect. The length of the longest common subsegment should be determined by the number of consecutive bits that are the same in \( x \oplus y \), not by these special cases.
   - The calculation of \( q \) and \( k - q \) is also incorrect. The length of the longest common subsegment should be the highest power of 2 that divides \( k \).

### Correctness:
**False**

The program has logical errors in handling the special cases and in calculating the length of the longest common subsegment. The correct approach should focus on the properties of the XOR operation and the binary representation of \( x \oplus y \).
