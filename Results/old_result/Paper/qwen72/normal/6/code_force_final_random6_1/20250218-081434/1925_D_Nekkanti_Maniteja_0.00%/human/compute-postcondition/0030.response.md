The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to `k` before the loop starts, but for the loop to execute, `i` must be 0 at the start of the loop.

Given that `k` must be less than `m`, and the loop will iterate `m` times, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than 0 and `i` is set to 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
