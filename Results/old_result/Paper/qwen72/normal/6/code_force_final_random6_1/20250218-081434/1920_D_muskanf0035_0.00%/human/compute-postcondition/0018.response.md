To determine what will be printed by the `print(*result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context in which the code is executed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` and `q` are positive integers provided by the user such that \(1 \leq n, q \leq 10^5\).
   - `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains two integers provided by the user.
   - `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user.
   - `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.
   - `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`.
   - `n` and `q` are now the positive integers input by the user.

2. **Function `func_1` and its Output:**
   - The function `func_1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is assumed to process the `operations` and `queries` lists and return a result.
   - The result of `func_1` is stored in the variable `result`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(*result)` statement will unpack the elements of `result` and print them separated by spaces.

Given the initial state and the context, the output of the `print(*result)` statement will depend on the specific implementation of `func_1`. However, based on the information provided, we can describe the output in a general way:

- `result` is the output of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, which processes the `operations` and `queries` lists.
- The exact values of `result` are not provided, but it is a list of some form.

Since the exact values of `result` are not known, the most precise description we can provide is:

Output: **[elements of result] (where result is the value returned by func_1(n, operations, queries))**

This means that the print statement will output the elements of the list `result`, separated by spaces, where `result` is the output of the function `func_1` based on the provided `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.
