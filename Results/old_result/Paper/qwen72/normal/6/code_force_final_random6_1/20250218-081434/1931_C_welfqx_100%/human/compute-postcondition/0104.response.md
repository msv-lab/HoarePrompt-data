The value of `cn` is incremented by 1. The conditions for `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, and `i` must be less than `n - 1`; `cn` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, and `i` must be less than `n - 1`; `cn` is increased by 1.**
