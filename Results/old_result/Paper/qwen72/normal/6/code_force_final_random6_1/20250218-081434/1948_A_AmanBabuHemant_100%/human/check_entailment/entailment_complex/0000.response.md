### Reasoning:

1. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading an integer `n`.

2. **Odd `n` Handling**:
   - The function checks if `n` is odd using `if n % 2:`. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to construct a string with an odd number of special characters where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is correct because special characters must come in pairs (e.g., "AA" or "BB").

3. **Even `n` Handling**:
   - If `n` is even, the function constructs a string `s` by repeating the pattern "AAB" `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that every "A" in the middle of "AAB" is a special character, and the "B" at the end of each "AAB" is not a special character. This is a valid approach to ensure that exactly `n` characters are special.
   - The function then checks if the length of the string `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints "YES" followed by the string `s`. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it prints "NO". This is correct because the problem specifies that the string length should not exceed 200.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1 (odd), printing "NO".
   - For `n = 2`, the function constructs "AAB" and prints "YES" followed by "AAB".
   - For `n = 6`, the function constructs "AAB" repeated 3 times, resulting in "AAB" * 3 = "AABAABAAB", and prints "YES" followed by "AABAABAAB".

5. **String Length Constraint**:
   - The maximum value of `n` is 50, and the string "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times will have a length of `3 * (n // 2)`. For `n = 50`, the length of the string is `3 * 25 = 75`, which is well within the 200-character limit. Therefore, the function will always print "YES" followed by the string for any valid `n`.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly handles all the requirements and constraints specified in the problem description. It correctly identifies when a solution is not possible (odd `n`) and constructs a valid string when a solution is possible (even `n`).

Correctness: **True**
