Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Each introvert must be alone in a tent.
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others.
   - Universals can be in any tent configuration (alone, with one other, or with two others).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function calculates the minimum number of tents required to accommodate extroverts and universals.
     - If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, it checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents.
     - If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to fill the last tent, and the function returns `None`.
     - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

   - **func_2**: This function combines the results from `func_1` with the number of introverts.
     - It calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals`.
     - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
     - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the value returned by `func_1`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no participants (`a = 0, b = 0, c = 0`), the program correctly returns 0.
   - If there are only introverts (`a > 0, b = 0, c = 0`), the program correctly returns the number of introverts.
   - If there are only extroverts and universals (`a = 0, b > 0, c > 0`), the program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed.
   - If there are only extroverts (`a = 0, b > 0, c = 0`), the program correctly returns -1 if `b % 3 != 0` because extroverts need to be in groups of 3.
   - If there are only universals (`a = 0, b = 0, c > 0`), the program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the test case `1 2 3`:
     - `func_1(2, 3)` returns 2 (since 2 extroverts need 2/3 = 1 tent, and 1 universal can fill the remaining spot, and 2 universals need 2/3 = 1 tent).
     - `func_2(1, 2, 3)` returns 1 (introverts) + 2 (from `func_1`) = 3.
   - For the test case `1 4 1`:
     - `func_1(4, 1)` returns `None` because 4 extroverts need 4/3 = 2 tents, and 2 extroverts need 1 more tent, but there is only 1 universal left, which is not enough.
     - `func_2(1, 4, 1)` returns -1.
   - For the test case `1 4 2`:
     - `func_1(4, 2)` returns 2 (since 4 extroverts need 4/3 = 2 tents, and 2 universals can fill the remaining spots in the last tent).
     - `func_2(1, 4, 2)` returns 1 (introverts) + 2 (from `func_1`) = 3.
   - For the test case `1 1 1`:
     - `func_1(1, 1)` returns `None` because 1 extrovert needs 1 more person to fill the tent, but there is only 1 universal left, which is not enough.
     - `func_2(1, 1, 1)` returns -1.
   - For the test case `1 3 2`:
     - `func_1(3, 2)` returns 2 (since 3 extroverts need 1 tent, and 2 universals need 2/3 = 1 tent).
     - `func_2(1, 3, 2)` returns 1 (introverts) + 2 (from `func_1`) = 3.
   - For the test case `19 7 18`:
     - `func_1(7, 18)` returns 9 (since 7 extroverts need 7/3 = 3 tents, and 18 universals need 18/3 = 6 tents).
     - `func_2(19, 7, 18)` returns 19 (introverts) + 9 (from `func_1`) = 28.
   - For the test case `0 0 0`:
     - `func_1(0, 0)` returns 0.
     - `func_2(0, 0, 0)` returns 0.
   - For the test case `7 0 0`:
     - `func_1(0, 0)` returns 0.
     - `func_2(7, 0, 0)` returns 7.
   - For the test case `0 24 0`:
     - `func_1(24, 0)` returns 8 (since 24 extroverts need 24/3 = 8 tents).
     - `func_2(0, 24, 0)` returns 8.
   - For the test case `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`:
     - `func_1(1000000000, 1000000000)` returns 666666667 (since 1000000000 extroverts need 1000000000/3 = 333333334 tents, and 1000000000 universals need 1000000000/3 = 333333334 tents, but we need to account for the remainder).
     - `func_2(1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)` returns 1000000000 (introverts) + 666666667 (from `func_1`) = 1666666667.

Based on the above reasoning and verification of the provided examples, the program appears to correctly handle all the given cases and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
