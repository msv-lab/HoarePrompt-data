Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed; `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s`; `i` has taken on the values of all characters in `s` during the loop. If `len(a) > 1`, `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` (starting from the middle) with the first half of `s` (up to the middle), and `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s`. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, then `newstr` is not equal to `s`. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, then `isreverse` is equal to `s`. If `len(a) == 1`, the set `a` contains exactly one unique character.***
