Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase exactly `k` tickets over `n` days, with a maximum of `m` tickets purchasable per day, and with the constraint that purchasing `x` tickets on day `i` increases the ticket price by `x` for all subsequent days.

### Key Points:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It also reads the list of ticket prices `M` for each day.

2. **Constraints:**
   - The program correctly handles the constraints by ensuring `m` is the minimum of `m` and `k` (since you can't buy more tickets than needed).

3. **Sorting:**
   - The program sorts the list `M` to ensure that the cheapest tickets are considered first.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days to Purchase:**
   - The program calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`, which represents the minimum number of days required to purchase all `k` tickets.

5. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program then selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` to purchase tickets.
   - If `n * m == k`, it means that the tickets can be evenly distributed over the selected days, and the cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - If `n * m != k`, it means that the tickets cannot be evenly distributed, and the program adjusts the cost by considering the remaining tickets `mu` that need to be purchased on the last day.

6. **Final Cost Calculation:**
   - The final cost calculation is correct for both scenarios (even distribution and uneven distribution).

### Potential Issues:
- **Variable Naming:**
  - The variable `N` is used to store the selected days, but it is not clearly named to reflect its purpose.
  - The variable `w` is used to store the last element of `N` when `n * m != k`, which is a bit confusing.

- **Redundant `continue` Statement:**
  - The `continue` statement at the end of the loop is redundant because the loop will naturally continue to the next iteration after printing the cost.

### Correctness:
Despite the minor issues in variable naming and the redundant `continue` statement, the logic of the program is correct and should produce the correct output for the given problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
