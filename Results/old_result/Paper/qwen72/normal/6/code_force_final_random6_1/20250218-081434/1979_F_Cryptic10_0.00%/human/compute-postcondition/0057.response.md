Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is -1, `path` contains at most one vertex (if a suitable `v` was found and added), `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any). If a suitable `v` was found and added to `path` during any iteration, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`. If no suitable `v` was found, `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `d = n - 1` down to `d = -1`.
- During each iteration, `func_1(d)` is called to get `v` and `u`.
- If `v` is 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.
- If `v` is not 0 and is in `remaining_vertices`, it is added to `path` and removed from `remaining_vertices`, and the loop breaks.
- If no suitable `v` is found after all iterations, `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.
- After all iterations, `d` will be -1, as the loop decrements `d` until it reaches -1.
