You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the provided function definition does not include any. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the length of the array `n`, and the array `a` itself. The input should be such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, with the additional constraint that the array `a` is beautiful in every test case, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise `flag` is False, and `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index where the first inequality was found.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise `flag` is False, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index where the first inequality was found, `ans` is the minimum of the lengths of consecutive sequences of `val` in `arr` if any inequality was found, otherwise `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity'), `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is the length of the last consecutive sequence of `val` in `arr` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `cnt` is 0.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: *`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `val` is `arr[0]`. If `flag` is True, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is the minimum of `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is the length of the last consecutive sequence of `val` in `arr`. If `flag` is False, `i` is the index where the first inequality was found, `ans` is the minimum of the lengths of consecutive sequences of `val` in `arr`, and `cnt` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts the number of test cases `t`, the length of the array `n`, and the array `a` itself. It returns the result based on the input parameters, ensuring that the array `a` is beautiful in every test case and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
