Output State: **`cycle_length` must be greater than 0, `cycle_score` is increased by the sum of the values of `a` at the positions visited during the entire cycle, `cycle_pos` is now equal to the position it was at the start of the cycle, `remaining_steps` is equal to `k - steps`, `full_cycles` is equal to `remaining_steps // cycle_length`.**

The value of `full_cycles` is calculated as the integer division of `remaining_steps` by `cycle_length`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
