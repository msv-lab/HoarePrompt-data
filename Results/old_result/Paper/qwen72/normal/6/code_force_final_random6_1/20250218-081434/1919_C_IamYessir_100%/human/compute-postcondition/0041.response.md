Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `b` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `x` is less than the first element of `lit`, `y` is the last element of `b` (which is the first element of `lit`), and `x` is less than `y`. Otherwise, the values of `x`, `y`, and `b` remain unchanged, and `x` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`.***
