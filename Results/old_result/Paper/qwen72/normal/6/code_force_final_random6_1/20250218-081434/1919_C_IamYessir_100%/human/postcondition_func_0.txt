The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `lit`. It then processes `lit` by distributing its elements into two lists `a` and `b` based on specific conditions. After processing, it calculates the total number of strictly increasing adjacent pairs in both `a` and `b` and prints this count for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `lit` is the last list of integers provided by the user, `a` and `b` are lists that have been modified based on the conditions in the loop body, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` or `b` was greater than its preceding element.
