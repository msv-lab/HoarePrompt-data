Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers input by the user, split by spaces.

2. **Understanding the `print` Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is `print(int(A * C / 2))`.
   - This statement will compute the value of the expression `A * C / 2` and then convert the result to an integer using the `int()` function.
   - The result will be printed.

3. **Values of Variables**:
   - `A` is the first integer input by the user.
   - `B` is the second integer input by the user (though it is not used in the `print` statement).
   - `C` is the third integer input by the user.

4. **Expression Calculation**:
   - The expression `A * C / 2` will first multiply `A` and `C`.
   - The result of the multiplication will then be divided by 2.
   - The division result will be converted to an integer using `int()`. This means any fractional part will be truncated (i.e., the result will be rounded down to the nearest whole number).

5. **Final Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the integer value of the expression `A * C / 2`.

Given the initial state and the `print` statement, the output will be the integer value of the expression `A * C / 2`.

Output: **int(A * C / 2) (where A and C are the first and third integers input by the user, respectively)**
