Output State: **`bets` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is increased by `prod // a[0]` + `a[1]` + `int(a[2])`, `a[1]` is updated to `prod // a[1]`, `a[2]` is updated to `prod // a[2]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is 2.
- The value of `sumo` is increased by `int(a[i])`, which is `int(a[2])`.
- The values of `bets`, `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` remain as they were updated in the initial state.
- The value of `sumo` is now increased by `prod // a[0]` + `a[1]` + `int(a[2])`.
