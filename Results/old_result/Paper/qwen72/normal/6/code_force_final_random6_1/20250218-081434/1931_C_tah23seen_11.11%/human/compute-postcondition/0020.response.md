Postcondition: **If `arr` is a palindrome, then `i` is len(arr) // 2 and `j` is len(arr) // 2 - 1 if the length of `arr` is even, or `i` is (len(arr) // 2) + 1 and `j` is len(arr) // 2 - 1 if the length of `arr` is odd. Additionally, `i` is greater than `j`. Otherwise, `i` and `j` remain at the positions where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`, and `i` is greater than `j`.**
