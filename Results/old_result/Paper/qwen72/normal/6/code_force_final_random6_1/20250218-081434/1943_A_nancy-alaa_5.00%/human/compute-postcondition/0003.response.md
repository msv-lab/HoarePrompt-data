Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (n ≥ 1), `arr` is a list of n integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. The total number of test cases t is provided, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n).**
