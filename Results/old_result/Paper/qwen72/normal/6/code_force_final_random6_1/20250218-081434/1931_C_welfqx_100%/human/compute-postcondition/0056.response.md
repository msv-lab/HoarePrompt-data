Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is the index where the first inequality was found if the loop was broken, otherwise `j` is `n-2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first integer in the list `num`, `symb2` is the last integer in the list `num`, `i` is `n-2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index where the first inequality was found, `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in the list `num` up to the point where the first inequality was found or the end of the list, `ii` is 2, `ck` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ck += 1` increments the value of `ck` by 1.
- Initially, `ck` is set to 2.
- After executing the code, `ck` becomes 3.
- All other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `f`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `i`, `cn`, `ii`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values or conditions.
