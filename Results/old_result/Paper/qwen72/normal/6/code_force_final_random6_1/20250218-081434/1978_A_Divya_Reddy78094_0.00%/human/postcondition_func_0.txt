The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the input, sorts the list in descending order, and prints the sum of the two largest integers in the list. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, `t` is the number of test cases, `_` is the loop counter (which will be `t-1` after the last iteration), `n` is the last input integer, and `nums` is the last sorted list of integers.
