Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, where `a` and `b` are positive integers. It then calculates a sum `suma` based on a specific formula involving `a` and `b`. The final result for each test case is `suma - 2`, which is printed to the output. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `T` is an input integer, `t` is `T - 1`, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]` from the last iteration, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` from the last iteration, and `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values for each iteration from 1 to `b` for each of the `T` iterations, with any additional 1s added when the conditions `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are met. **
