Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers representing the converted input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and is now `T - 1`.**

The code converts the list `a` from a list of strings to a list of integers using the `map` function and a lambda function that applies the `int` function to each element of `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `T` remain unchanged, with `T` still being a non-zero integer and now equal to `T - 1`.
