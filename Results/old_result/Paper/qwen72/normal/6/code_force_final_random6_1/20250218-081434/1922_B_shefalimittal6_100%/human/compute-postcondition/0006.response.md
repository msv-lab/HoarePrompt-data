The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is the integer value of the first element in the `data` list, and `idx` is 1. However, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 1, `data` is a list of strings, each string being a part of the input data split by spaces, `results` is an empty list**
