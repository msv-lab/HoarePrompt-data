Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is a list of integers where each element represents the largest number for each test case (1 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5).** 

The value of `t` is now an integer provided by the user, and the list `n` remains unchanged. The function is expected to accept `t` and `n` as parameters, where `t` represents the number of test cases, and `n` is a list of integers with each element being the largest number for each test case.
