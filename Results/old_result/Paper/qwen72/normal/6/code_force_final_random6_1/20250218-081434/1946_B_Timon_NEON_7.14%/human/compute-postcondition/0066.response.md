Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where \(-10^9 \leq arr[i] \leq 10^9\), `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum found during the loop, `segments_variants` is a list of all segments that were considered but not chosen as the `max_segment` and must have at least one more segment, `new_segment` is a list containing the sum of the last segment and the index of the last element in that segment, and the last element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0. If `total_max_segment[0]` (the sum of the current maximum segment) is less than `segment[0]` (the sum of the new segment), then `total_max_segment` is updated to `segment`, and `max_segment` is updated to the segment corresponding to `segment`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` and `max_segment` remain unchanged.***
