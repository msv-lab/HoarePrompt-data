Output State: **`[*open(0)][1:]` must be a list containing at least two elements, `s` is the second element in the list, `n` is the first integer in `s` after splitting by spaces, `k` is the second integer in `s` after splitting by spaces, `n` and `k` are now integers.**

The code snippet `n, k = map(int, s.split())` converts the first and second integers in the string `s` (which is the second element of the list `[*open(0)][1:]`) into integers and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state conditions remain valid, and the only change is that `n` and `k` are now explicitly integers.
