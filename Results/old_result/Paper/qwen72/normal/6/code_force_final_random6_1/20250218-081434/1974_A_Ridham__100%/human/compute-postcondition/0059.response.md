Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from user input. It calculates the number of screens required to accommodate `x` and `y` based on the following rules: `x` requires 1 unit of space, and `y` requires 4 units of space. If the space required for `x` can fit into the remaining cells after allocating space for `y` (where each screen can hold up to 15 units of space for `y`), the function appends the number of screens required for `y` to the result list. If not, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining space required by `x` and appends the total number of screens to the result list. Finally, the function prints the number of screens required for each test case, one per line. **
