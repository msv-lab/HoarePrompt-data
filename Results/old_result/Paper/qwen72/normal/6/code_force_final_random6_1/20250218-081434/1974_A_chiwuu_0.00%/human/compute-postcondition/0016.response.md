Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first input string, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is less than `a`, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, if `t` is divisible by 5, `t` is now equal to `2 * b // 5`, otherwise `t` is now equal to `2 * b // 5 + 1`, `t2` is equal to `a - t1`, and `t2` is divisible by 15.**
