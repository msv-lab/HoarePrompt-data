The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer (n ≥ 2).

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2.
- `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue. Since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (n ≥ 3), `i` is 2**
