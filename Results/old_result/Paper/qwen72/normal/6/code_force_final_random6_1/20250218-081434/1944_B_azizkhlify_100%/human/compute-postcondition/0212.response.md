Postcondition: ***The loop has finished executing, and all elements in `res` have been printed, one after another, separated by spaces. The values of `n`, `l`, `r`, `ul`, `ur`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states, except if `ul` is not equal to `ur`, in which case all elements in `res` that meet the condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` have been printed, each element printed twice, separated by spaces, and `ur` may have been increased by 2 for each element in `a` that met this condition within the range `n` to `2 * n - 1`. The loop breaks if `ul` equals `ur` at any point during execution.***
