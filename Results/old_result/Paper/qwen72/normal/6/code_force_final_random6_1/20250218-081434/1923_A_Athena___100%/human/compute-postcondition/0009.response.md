The variables in the loop head are `a` and `a[0]`. The loop condition checks if `a` is not empty and if the first element of `a` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still be non-empty and its first element must be 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a non-empty list with its first element removed, and `a[0]` was 0. To ensure the loop can execute again, `a` must still be non-empty, and the next element in `a` (which is now the first element) must also be 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with its first element removed and the new first element must be 0, `res` is 0**
