Output State: **`ii` is 2, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `t` is the input string, `l` is the number of times 'L' appears in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where each element is updated to `k` based on the loop, `k` is the final value after all iterations, `i` is -1, `q1` is either -1 or `l - n` depending on the last character of `t`, `q2` is either `l + n - 1` or `l + n` depending on the last character of `t`, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of integers input by the user, so after executing the code, `a` is updated to the new list of integers provided by the user.
- All other variables (`ii`, `m`, `t`, `l`, `y`, `k`, `i`, `q1`, `q2`, `n`) remain unchanged.
