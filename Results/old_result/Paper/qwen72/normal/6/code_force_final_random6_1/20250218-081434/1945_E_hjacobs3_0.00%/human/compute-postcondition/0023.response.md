Postcondition: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= n, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` >= `find`, or `l` is n if no such index exists. `r` is the largest index such that `array[r]` < `find`, or `r` is -1 if no such index exists. Additionally, `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`.**
