The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `x` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `x` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 2, `i` is 1, `s` is `1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1`, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer.**
