You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

#Function 3:

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `number`, which is an integer, and `quantity`, which is a non-negative integer. It initializes a variable `answer` to 0. After the function concludes, `answer` remains 0, and the function returns `None`. The function does not modify the input parameters `number` and `quantity`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` integers and we need to perform `k` operations.
   - In each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray, compute its sum, and insert this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations, and the result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1:** This function takes a number and returns it modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is correct and necessary for the problem.
   - **func_2:** This function is supposed to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices. However, there are several issues:
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array is entirely negative.
     - The function does not correctly update `max_segment` and `new_segment` in all scenarios.
     - The function does not correctly append the last segment if it is positive.
     - The function returns a segment with a negative sum if no positive segment is found, which is incorrect.
   - **func_3:** This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operations. It is supposed to compute the final answer but is not implemented.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - The key insight is that the maximum sum of the array after `k` operations can be achieved by repeatedly adding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is positive, we can add it `k` times to the array.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is zero or negative, the best strategy is to add zero `k` times, which does not change the sum of the array.

4. **Kadane's Algorithm:**
   - To find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, we can use Kadane's algorithm, which efficiently computes this in \(O(n)\) time.
   - Once we have the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, we can compute the final sum as `max_sum * (k + 1) + initial_sum` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Implementation:**
   - The provided `func_2` is not correctly implementing Kadane's algorithm.
   - The provided `func_3` is incomplete and does not compute the final answer.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the provided functions, the program is incorrect.
