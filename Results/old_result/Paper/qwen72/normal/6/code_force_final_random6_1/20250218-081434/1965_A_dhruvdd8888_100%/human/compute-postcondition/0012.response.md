Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and must have at least 3 elements, `ls` is equal to the first element of `nums` plus `nums[1] - ls`, `i` is 2, `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - ls`, `nums[2]` is now `nums[2] - ls`.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums[i] -= ls` updates the value of `nums[2]` by subtracting `ls` from it.
- The value of `i` is 2, so `nums[2]` is affected.
- `ls` is equal to the first element of `nums` plus `nums[1] - ls`.
- `nums[1]` is already updated to `nums[1] - ls`.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
