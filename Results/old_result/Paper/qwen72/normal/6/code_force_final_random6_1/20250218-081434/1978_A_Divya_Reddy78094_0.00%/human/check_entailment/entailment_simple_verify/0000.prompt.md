You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

    2
    
    10 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    2
    4
    5
    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of pages in each book.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums`.

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list of pages in descending order using `nums.sort(reverse=True)`. This ensures that the two largest elements are at the beginning of the list.

3. **Output**: The program prints the sum of the two largest elements in the sorted list, which corresponds to the maximum number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles and reading the book with the highest number of pages in each pile.

The program correctly identifies the two largest elements in the list and sums them, which is the optimal way to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read. There are no edge cases or missing logic that would cause the program to fail for any valid input.
