Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `v` is the last vertex in the stack, `postorder` is the last boolean value in the stack, `stack` is the stack with the tuple `(v, True)`, `(u, False)` appended, and now `(u, False)` is appended again at the end, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two children, `u` is the second child of `v`.**

In natural language: The stack now contains an additional tuple `(u, False)` at the end, while all other conditions and variable values remain unchanged. The stack now has the tuples `(v, True)` and two instances of `(u, False)`.
