Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve a problem where it needs to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the logic implemented in the program does not correctly reflect the problem statement.

Here are the issues:
1. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula used in the program, \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\), does not correctly determine the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. **Additional Condition**: The additional condition \((a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0\) is not relevant to the problem and does not help in counting the valid pairs.
3. **Subtraction of 2**: The final result is `suma - 2`, which is not justified by the problem statement. The correct result should be the sum of valid pairs without arbitrary subtraction.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges.
2. For each pair, compute \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

Given the constraints, a more efficient approach is needed to avoid a time complexity of \(O(n \cdot m)\). One possible efficient approach is to use the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the relationship between \(a\) and \(b\).

Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs as described in the problem statement. The formula and additional conditions are not aligned with the problem requirements, and the arbitrary subtraction of 2 is incorrect.
