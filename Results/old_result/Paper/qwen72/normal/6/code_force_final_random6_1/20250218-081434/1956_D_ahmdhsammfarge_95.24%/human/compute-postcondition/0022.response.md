Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 2 ≤ n ≤ 18, `r` is 0, `l` is the index j where the condition `sm > over_sum` was last satisfied, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `sm` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1) ** 2`.**

Explanation:
- `sm` is calculated as the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` (which is `lst[0]` since `i` is 1) plus the sum of the elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst` (which is `lst[3:]` since `j` is 2) plus `(j - i + 1) ** 2` (which is `(2 - 1 + 1) ** 2 = 4`).
- The other variables (`lst`, `r`, `l`, `over_sum`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
