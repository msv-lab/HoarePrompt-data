### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires us to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
     - Both strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
     - String `c` does not match the template `t`.
   - A string `s` matches the template `t` if:
     - For each position `i`, if `t[i]` is lowercase, `s[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`.
     - For each position `i`, if `t[i]` is uppercase, `s[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

2. **Function 1 Analysis (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (length of the strings), `a`, `b`, and `c` (the strings themselves).
   - It iterates over each position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each position `i`, it checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - If such a position is found, it returns 'YES'.
   - If no such position is found, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Function 2 Analysis (`func_2`):**
   - The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` and calls `func_1` with these parameters.
   - It collects the results of each test case in a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the list.

4. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if there exists a position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - If such a position exists, it is possible to construct a template `t` where `t[i]` is an uppercase letter that is different from the lowercase version of `c[i]`, and both `a` and `b` will match this template while `c` will not.
   - If no such position exists, it is impossible to construct such a template, and the function correctly returns 'NO'.

5. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - It prints the results in the correct order.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:

- The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and behavior of both `func_1` and `func_2`.
- The reasoning provided in the original assessment is accurate and aligns with the problem description.
- The function `func_1` indeed checks the necessary condition for the existence of a template `t` that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.
- The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results in the correct order.

### Final Evaluation:

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. It correctly determines if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not.

Final: **True**
