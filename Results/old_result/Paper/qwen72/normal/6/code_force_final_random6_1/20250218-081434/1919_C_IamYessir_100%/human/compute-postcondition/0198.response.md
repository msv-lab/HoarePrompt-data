Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, and `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]` and `lit[1]` is greater than `y`, then `a` includes the second element of `lit` (i.e., `lit[1]`), and `x` is set to `lit[1]`. If `b` is an empty list, `y` remains infinity; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` is less than `lit[1]` or `lit[1]` is less than or equal to `y`, `a` and `x` remain unchanged.***
