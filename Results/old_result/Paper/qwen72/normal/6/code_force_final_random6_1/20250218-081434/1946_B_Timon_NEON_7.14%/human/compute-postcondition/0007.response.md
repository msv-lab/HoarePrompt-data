Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is not an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and the first element of `arr` (i.e., `arr[0]`) is less than 0. Additionally, the current value of `max_segment[0]` is greater than the current value of `new_segment[0]`.**
