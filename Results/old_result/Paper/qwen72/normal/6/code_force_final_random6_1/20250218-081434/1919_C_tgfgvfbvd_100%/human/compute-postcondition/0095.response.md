Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 0. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is set to `l[x]`, and the values of `a`, `c` remain unchanged. If `l[x]` is greater than `b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`, `b` remains `float('inf')`, `c` is set to 1, and `l[x]` is greater than `a`. Additionally, if `a` > `b`, then `a` is set to `b`. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `x` remain unchanged.***
