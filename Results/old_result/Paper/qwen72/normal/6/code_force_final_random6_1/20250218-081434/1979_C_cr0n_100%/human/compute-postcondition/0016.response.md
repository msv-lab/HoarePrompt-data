Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement.

### Initial State:
1. **N**: An input integer where \(1 \leq N \leq 50\).
2. **vals**: A list of integers where each element \(k_i\) is a multiplier for the i-th outcome, and \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\) for all \(0 \leq i < N\).
3. **den**: Initially, `den` is some value, and it is modified by applying `func_1` to it and each element of `vals` in sequence.
4. **vprod**: A list of integers where each element is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals` (using integer division).
5. **den**: After calculating `vprod`, `den` is updated to `den` minus the sum of all elements in `vprod`.
6. **den**: It is given that `den` is greater than 0 after the update.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Value of `den`**:
   - The initial value of `den` is not explicitly given, but it is modified by `func_1` with each element of `vals`.

2. **Modification of `den`**:
   - `func_1` is applied to `den` and each element of `vals` in sequence. The exact nature of `func_1` is not provided, but it modifies `den` in some way.

3. **Calculation of `vprod`**:
   - After `den` is modified, `vprod` is calculated as a list of integers where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals` using integer division.
   - For example, if `den` is 100 and `vals` is [2, 5, 10], then `vprod` would be [100 // 2, 100 // 5, 100 // 10] = [50, 20, 10].

4. **Update of `den`**:
   - `den` is updated to `den` minus the sum of all elements in `vprod`.
   - Using the previous example, if `vprod` is [50, 20, 10], then the sum of `vprod` is 80, and `den` would be updated to 100 - 80 = 20.

5. **Condition on `den`**:
   - It is given that `den` is greater than 0 after the update.

### Final Output:
- The `print` statement will print the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string.
- Each element in `vprod` is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals` using integer division.

### Example Calculation:
- Let's assume `N = 3`, `vals = [2, 5, 10]`, and `den` is initially 100.
- After applying `func_1`, let's assume `den` remains 100 (since the exact nature of `func_1` is not given).
- `vprod` is calculated as [100 // 2, 100 // 5, 100 // 10] = [50, 20, 10].
- The sum of `vprod` is 50 + 20 + 10 = 80.
- `den` is updated to 100 - 80 = 20, which is greater than 0.
- The `print` statement will output: `50 20 10`.

### General Output:
- The output will be a space-separated string of integers, where each integer is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals` using integer division.

Output: **vprod (where vprod is a list of integers, each element being the result of den divided by the corresponding element in vals using integer division)**
