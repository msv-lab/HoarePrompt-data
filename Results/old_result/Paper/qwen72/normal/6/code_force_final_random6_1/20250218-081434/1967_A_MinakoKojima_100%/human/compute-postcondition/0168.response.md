Postcondition: **`_` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 1`. If `dif` is not 0, `res` is `n - 2` if `k` is 0 or `k` is updated to `k - dif`. In both cases, `ans` is the second element of `a` if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, otherwise `ans` is the first element of `a` plus `k // (i + 1)` and `k` is set to 0.**
