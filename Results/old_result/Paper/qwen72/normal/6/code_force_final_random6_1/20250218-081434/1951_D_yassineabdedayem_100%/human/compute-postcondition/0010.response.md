Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `_` is a placeholder variable, which means it is not used in the code and can be ignored.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the standard input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer in the input line.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- The current value of `n` plus 2 is greater than the current value of `k` times 2. This can be expressed as:
  \[
  n + 2 > 2k
  \]

### Code Snippet:
```
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `2`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `_` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always output the integer `2`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `_`.

Output: **2**
