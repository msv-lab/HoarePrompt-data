### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `n` for each test case.
   - This is accurate and follows the problem description.

2. **Alphabet Initialization:**
   - The program initializes the alphabet as a string of lowercase letters using `string.ascii_lowercase`.
   - This is correct and ensures that the alphabet is in the correct order.

3. **Word Construction:**
   - The program constructs the lexicographically smallest word based on the value of `n`:
     - **Case 1: `n > 52`**
       - If `n` is greater than 52, the program constructs the word by adding the letter at position `n - 53` followed by "zz".
       - This is correct because the maximum value for a single letter is 26, so the smallest possible word with a sum greater than 52 is "azz" (1 + 26 + 26 = 53). For `n = 54`, the word would be "bzz" (2 + 26 + 26 = 54), and so on.
     - **Case 2: `n > 27`**
       - If `n` is greater than 27 but less than or equal to 52, the program constructs the word by adding "a" followed by the letter at position `n - 28` and then "z".
       - This is correct because the smallest possible word with a sum greater than 27 is "aaz" (1 + 1 + 26 = 28). For `n = 29`, the word would be "abz" (1 + 2 + 26 = 29), and so on.
     - **Case 3: `n == 27`**
       - If `n` is exactly 27, the program constructs the word "aay".
       - This is correct because "aay" (1 + 1 + 25 = 27) is the lexicographically smallest word that sums to 27.
     - **Case 4: `n <= 26`**
       - If `n` is less than or equal to 26, the program constructs the word by adding "aa" followed by the letter at position `n - 3`.
       - This is correct because the smallest possible word with a sum less than or equal to 26 is "aaa" (1 + 1 + 1 = 3). For `n = 4`, the word would be "aab" (1 + 1 + 2 = 4), and so on.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed word for each test case, which is the correct output format.
   - This is accurate and follows the problem description.

### Evaluation of Annotated Code:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The logic for constructing the word based on the value of `n` is consistent with the problem requirements and the original assessment.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all the cases and constructs the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded sum `n`.

Final: **True**
