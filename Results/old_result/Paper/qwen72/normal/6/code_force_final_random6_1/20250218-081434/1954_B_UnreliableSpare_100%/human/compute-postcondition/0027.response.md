Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 2, `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity') if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, otherwise `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1.
- If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` was initially 1, so after the increment, `cnt` becomes 2.
- If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `cnt` was initially 0, so after the increment, `cnt` becomes 1.
- The value of `ans` remains unchanged based on the initial conditions.
- All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
