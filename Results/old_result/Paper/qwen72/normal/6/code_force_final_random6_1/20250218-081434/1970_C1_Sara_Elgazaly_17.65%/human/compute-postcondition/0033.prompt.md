Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is `x - 1`, `a` and `b` are integers based on the input, `lst[a]` is a list that includes all the `b` values appended during the iterations, `lst[b]` is a list that includes all the `a` values appended during the iterations, `s` is True, and `lst[x]` must be a non-empty list.
Code of the loop:
while lst[x]:
    y = lst[x].pop()
    if lst[y] != []:
        x = y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is `x - 1`, `a` and `b` are integers based on the input, `lst[a]` is a list that includes all the `b` values appended during the iterations, `lst[b]` is a list that includes all the `a` values appended during the iterations, `s` is True, `lst[x]` is a list with one fewer element, and `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the operation. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, `x` is set to the last element of `lst[x]` before the operation, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `x` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is `x - 1`, `a` and `b` are integers based on the input, `lst[a]` is a list that includes all the `b` values appended during the iterations, `lst[b]` is a list that includes all the `a` values appended during the iterations, `s` is True, `lst[x]` is a list with at least one element, and `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before the operation, which has now been removed from `lst[x]`. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`x` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is `x - 1`, `a` and `b` are integers based on the input, `lst[a]` is a list that includes all the `b` values appended during the iterations, `lst[b]` is a list that includes all the `a` values appended during the iterations, `s` is True, and `lst[x]` is a list with at least one element. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, `x` is equal to the last element of `lst[x]` before the operation, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `lst[y]` is an empty list, the state of the variables remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
