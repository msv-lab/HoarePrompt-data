To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as the second element of the tuple `e` (which is the result of `heappop(min_heap)`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `min_heap` is a valid min-heap with at least one tuple `(value, index)` where `index <= 0`.
   - `i` is `d + 2`.
   - `row[i]` has been updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.
   - `row` must have at least `d + 2` elements.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - The loop condition depends on the value of `e[1]` and `i`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple `e` popped from `min_heap` must have `e[1]` such that `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.
   - Given that `i` is `d + 2`, the condition simplifies to `e[1] <= (d + 2) - (d + 2)`, which is `e[1] <= 0`.

4. **Current Tuple in `min_heap`:**
   - The current state indicates that `min_heap` contains at least one tuple `(value, index)` where `index <= 0`.
   - This means that the next `heappop(min_heap)` will return a tuple where `e[1] <= 0`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the current state already ensures that `e[1] <= 0`, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`min_heap` is a valid min-heap with at least one tuple `(value, index)` where `index <= 0`, `i` is `d + 2`, `row[i]` has been updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, `row` must have at least `d + 2` elements**
