Reasoning:

The program aims to construct an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The approach taken by the program is to decompose `X - 1` into a sum of numbers of the form `2^i - 1`, which is a clever way to ensure that the array can be constructed with the required number of increasing subsequences.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads the integer `X` for the current test case.
   - It subtracts 1 from `X` to handle the fact that an empty subsequence is also considered increasing.
   - It initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` to store the lengths of the subsequences and a variable `mx` to keep track of the maximum length encountered.

3. **Decomposition**:
   - The program uses a while loop to decompose `x` (which is `X - 1`) into a sum of numbers of the form `2^i - 1`.
   - It finds the largest `i` such that `2^(i+1) <= x + 1` and appends `i` to `subseq_lens`.
   - It subtracts `2^i - 1` from `x` and updates `mx` to the maximum of `mx` and `i`.
   - This process continues until `x` becomes 0.

4. **Constructing the Array**:
   - The program constructs the array `ansv` by first adding the integers from 0 to `mx - 1`.
   - It then appends the elements from `subseq_lens` (excluding the first element) to `ansv`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv`.

### Analysis of the Approach:
- **Decomposition**: The decomposition of `X - 1` into a sum of `2^i - 1` values is correct because each `2^i - 1` represents the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed by adding a new element to an existing array of length `i`.
- **Array Construction**: The array `ansv` is constructed by first adding a sequence of distinct integers from 0 to `mx - 1`, which ensures that the initial part of the array has a large number of increasing subsequences. The additional elements from `subseq_lens` are appended to ensure that the total number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where `X` is 1. According to the problem, `X` ranges from 2 to \(10^{18}\), so this is not a concern.
- **Output for No Solution**: The program does not print `-1` if no solution exists. However, the problem states that a solution always exists for the given range of `X`, so this is not a concern.
- **Array Length**: The program ensures that the array length is at most 200 by the nature of the decomposition, which is efficient and within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly follow the logic and constraints provided in the problem description. It constructs an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences and ensures the array length is within the specified limit.

Correctness: **True**
