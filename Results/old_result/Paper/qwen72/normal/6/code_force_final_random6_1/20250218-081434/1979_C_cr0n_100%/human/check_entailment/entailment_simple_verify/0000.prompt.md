You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer representing the number of outcomes, and vals is a list of integers where each element is a multiplier (k_i) for the i-th outcome, such that 1 <= N <= 50 and 2 <= vals[i] <= 20 for all 0 <= i < N.

    vprod = [(den // r) for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns without any value, as the return statement is empty.
    #State: N is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers where each element is a multiplier (k_i) for the i-th outcome, such that 1 <= N <= 50 and 2 <= vals[i] <= 20 for all 0 <= i < N, `den` is the result of applying `func_1` to the initial value of `den` and each element of `vals` in sequence, `vprod` is a list of integers where each element is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals` (using integer division), `den` is now `den` minus the sum of all elements in `vprod`, and `den` is greater than 0.
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: vprod (where vprod is a list of integers, each element being the result of den divided by the corresponding element in vals using integer division)




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where all multipliers are the same. For example, consider the input where `n = 5` and `k_1 = k_2 = k_3 = k_4 = k_5 = 5`. According to the problem description, the total amount of coins bet should be strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. However, the program will output `-1` for this case, which is incorrect because a valid solution exists. For instance, betting 1 coin on each outcome would result in a total bet of 5 coins, and the return for any winning outcome would be 5 coins, which is not strictly greater but equal. Therefore, the program fails to provide a correct solution for this case.
