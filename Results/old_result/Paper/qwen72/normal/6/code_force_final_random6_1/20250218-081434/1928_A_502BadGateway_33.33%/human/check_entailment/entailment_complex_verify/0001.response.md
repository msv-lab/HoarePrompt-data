Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem is about determining if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged (including rotations) to form a different rectangle. The key is to check if the original rectangle can be transformed into a new one with a different aspect ratio.

2. **Analyzing the Solution**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) of the rectangle.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(a, b)` to determine if Bob can form another rectangle.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` returns 'yes' if \(b\) is even and 'no' otherwise.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` checks if \(b\) is even. If \(b\) is even, it means the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles of size \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\).
   - After cutting, Bob can rearrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle of size \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\).
   - The new rectangle \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\) will have a different aspect ratio from the original \(a \times b\) if \(a \neq b\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), the rectangle cannot be cut, and the function correctly returns 'no'.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\), the rectangle can only be cut into two \(1 \times 1\) rectangles, and the function correctly returns 'no'.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 6\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle, which is different from the original. The function correctly returns 'yes'.
   - If \(a = 3\) and \(b = 2\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle, which is different from the original. The function correctly returns 'yes'.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(1 \times 2\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(1 \times 4\) rectangle, which is different from the original. The function correctly returns 'yes'.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 4\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle, which is different from the original. The function correctly returns 'yes'.
   - If \(a = 6\) and \(b = 3\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(6 \times 1.5\) rectangles, but since \(b\) is not even, the function correctly returns 'no'.

5. **Challenges to the Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the function checks if \(b\) is even, which is a necessary condition for Bob to be able to cut the rectangle and form a new one.
   - However, the assessment does not consider the case where \(a\) is even and \(b\) is odd. In such cases, Bob can still cut the rectangle along the \(a\) dimension to form two smaller rectangles of size \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\), and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle of size \(\frac{a}{2} \times 2b\), which will have a different aspect ratio if \(a \neq b\).

6. **Revised Logic**:
   - The correct logic should be to check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If either dimension is even, Bob can cut the rectangle and form a new one with a different aspect ratio.
   - The current implementation only checks if \(b\) is even, which is insufficient.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment is partially correct in identifying the evenness check but is incomplete in considering all possible cases.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` is not fully correct because it only checks if \(b\) is even and ignores the possibility that \(a\) could be even.

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not consider the case where \(a\) is even and \(b\) is odd. To fix this, the function should return 'yes' if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even.
