To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized by the `range(n + 1)` function, which means it will start at 0 and increment by 1 until it reaches `n`.
2. **Variable `n`**: This variable must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once. The condition given is that `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for all `i`, and the length of `arr` is `n`.
- `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `freq[j]` represents the number of times the integer `j` appears in `arr`.
- `cou` is 0.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` is at least 1 and `i` is 0 (since the loop starts with `i` at 0).

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for all `i`, and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5), `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `freq[j]` represents the number of times the integer `j` appears in `arr`, `cou` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
