Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is `a[0]`, `res` is `n - 1`, `k` is 0 or the remaining value after the last iteration, `ans_list` contains the value of `ans`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is updated to `n - 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, `ans`, `ans_list`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
