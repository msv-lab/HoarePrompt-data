Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of some list (not explicitly mentioned, but we can infer it's related to `rdb` or `rgt`).
   - `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively and must have at least 2 elements.
   - `elem` is the second element in `rdb`.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` remains 0 and the program continues executing the next statement after the if block.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - `elem` is defined as the second element in the list `rdb`.
   - Since `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively and must have at least 2 elements, `rdb` must have at least 2 elements.
   - Therefore, `elem` is a valid element in `rdb`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space.
   - Since the exact values of `rdb` and `elem` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `elem`.

Output: **elem elem **(where `elem` is the second element in the list `rdb`)**
