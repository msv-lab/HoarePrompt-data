Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `results` is a list containing `t` results, where each result is the output of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration.
   - `result` is the third element of the `results` list.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(result)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
   - The list `results` contains `t` elements, each of which is the result of calling `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for some values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - The variable `result` is specifically the third element of the `results` list. Since Python uses zero-based indexing, `result` corresponds to `results[2]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the third element of the `results` list.
   - The exact value of `result` depends on the output of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for the third iteration.

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` for the third iteration are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the function call.

Output: **result (where result is the output of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for the third iteration)**
