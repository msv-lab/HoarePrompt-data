Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations. For each test case, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` and `b` are lists of strings where each string is a character from the input string. The variable `_` has been incremented by 1 for each iteration, and the final value of `_` is equal to the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, if the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`, the output "No" was printed. Otherwise, the output "Yes" was printed.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has run `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the loop reads an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b`, each of length `n`. It then checks if the character at index `n - 2` in the string `b` is `"<"`. If it is, the loop prints "No". If it is not, the loop prints "Yes". The variable `_` keeps track of the number of iterations, and after all iterations, its value is equal to `t`. The state of the variables `a` and `b` is reset for each test case, and the final state of these variables is not relevant after the loop completes.
