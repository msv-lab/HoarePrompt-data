Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0, and it is now `t - 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - If `n` is odd, `s` remains unchanged.
   - If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
   - The length of `s` is less than 200 if `n` is even and the initial length of `s` was less than 200.
   - The length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200 if `n` is even and the initial length of `s` was greater than or equal to 200.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string 'YES'.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement is not dependent on these variables.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print 'YES' regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `s`.

Output: **YES**
