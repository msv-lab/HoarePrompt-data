Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (n â‰¥ 1), `arr` is a list of n integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `first` is False.**

The value of `first` has been explicitly set to `False`, and the other variables (`n`, `arr`, `mpp`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The total number of test cases `t` and the constraints on `n` and the elements of `arr` are still valid.
