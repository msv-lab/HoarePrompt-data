### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful.
   - A beautiful array can be modified by replacing an element \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \) if \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).
   - If the array consists entirely of the same element, it will always remain beautiful, so the answer is -1.
   - For other arrays, we need to find the minimum number of elements to remove to prevent any further operations from making all elements the same.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array.
   - It initializes `cnt` to count consecutive elements equal to `tmp`.
   - It initializes `ans` to the length of the array \( n \).
   - It iterates through the array:
     - If the current element is equal to `tmp`, it increments `cnt`.
     - If the current element is not equal to `tmp`, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.
   - Finally, it checks if \( n \) is 1 or if `ans` is equal to \( n \). If either condition is true, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies if the array consists entirely of the same element by checking if `ans` is equal to \( n \) after the loop.
   - The program correctly updates `ans` to the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found during the iteration.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where the array has more than one distinct element but is still beautiful due to the pattern \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \). For example, in the array [1, 2, 1, 2, 1], the program will output 1, which is correct, but it does not explicitly check if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - For \( n = 1 \), the program correctly outputs -1.
   - For arrays where all elements are the same, the program correctly outputs -1.
   - For arrays with a pattern like [1, 2, 1, 2, 1], the program correctly outputs 1.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program seems to handle the given problem correctly for the provided examples and edge cases.
   - However, it does not explicitly check if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements, but it implicitly does so by finding the minimum count of consecutive elements.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples. It correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, or outputs -1 if it is impossible.
