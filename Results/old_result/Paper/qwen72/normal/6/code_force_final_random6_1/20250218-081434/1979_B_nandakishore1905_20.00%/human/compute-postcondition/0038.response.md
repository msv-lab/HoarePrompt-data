Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x â‰  y, `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are new input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the binary representation of `k`, and `q` is 2 raised to the power of (p - 1).**

Explanation:
- The values of `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- `l` is assigned the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
- `p` is assigned the length of the binary representation of `k`.
- `q` is assigned 2 raised to the power of (p - 1).
