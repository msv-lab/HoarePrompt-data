Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `num2` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, and `order` is 1, 2, or 3. If `a[0]` is greater than or equal to `a[1]`, then `order` is 1. If `a[1]` is greater than or equal to `a[2]`, then `order` is 2. If `a[2]` is greater than or equal to `a[3]`, then `order` is 3. Otherwise, `order` is 1.***
