Output State: **`input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read by `sys.stdin`, `index` is 5, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of the string at `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of the string at `data[3]`, `PS` is the integer value of the string at `data[4]`, `p` is a list of integers from the strings at `data[5:5 + n]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` creates a new list `p` by converting the strings from the slice `data[5:5 + n]` to integers. The value of `index` is 5, and `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]`. Therefore, `p` contains the integers from the strings starting at `data[5]` and continuing for `n` elements. The other variables remain unchanged.
