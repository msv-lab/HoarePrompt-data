The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `lst`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the length of `lst`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `4 ≤ n ≤ 18`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `len(lst)`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the next value of `j` will be 4. For the loop to execute again, `len(lst)` must be greater than 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `5 ≤ n ≤ 18`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `sm` is the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index 4 to the end of `lst` plus 4. If `sm` > `over_sum`, `over_sum` is equal to `sm`, `r` is 2, and `l` is 3.**
