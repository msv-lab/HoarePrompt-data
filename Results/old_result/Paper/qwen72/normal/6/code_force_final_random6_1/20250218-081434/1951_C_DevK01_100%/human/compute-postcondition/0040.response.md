Output State: **`L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input provided by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second integer in `L` and the third integer in `L`, `k` is the third integer in `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `cost` and `N` are not yet defined, and `mu` is not yet defined.**

Explanation:
- `L` is now a list of integers provided by the user.
- `M` is updated to be a sorted list of integers converted from the user input.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`) retain their initial values or are based on the values in the new `L`.
- `N`, `cost`, and `mu` are not yet defined as the code snippet provided does not include their initialization or calculation.
