Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 0, `dif` is the difference between the second and the first element of `a`, `dif` is not 0, and `res` remains equal to `n - 1` or `n - 2`. If `k` is 0, `ans` is set to the first element of `a`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
