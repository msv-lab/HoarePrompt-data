Output State: **`input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read by `sys.stdin`, `index` is now 13 + `5 * n`, `t` must be greater than 1, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the new `result`, `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]` and now also the integer value of the string at `data[5 + 2 * n]` and `data[index - 4]`, `k` is now the integer value of the string at `data[index - 3]`, `PB` is now the integer value of the string at `data[index - 2]`, `PS` is now the integer value of the string at `data[index - 1]`, `p` is now a list of integers from the strings at `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is now a list of integers from the strings at `data[index:index + n]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` updates the value of `a` to be a list of integers converted from the strings in the slice `data[index:index + n]`.
- The precondition states that `a` was previously a list of integers from the strings at `data[index - 4:index - 4 + n]`.
- After the code execution, `a` is now a list of integers from the strings at `data[index:index + n]`, which is the same as the new value of `p`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
