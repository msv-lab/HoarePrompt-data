Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `bets` is an input integer greater than 0.
2. `sumo` is the sum of the integers `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`.
3. `i` is `bets - 1`.
4. `a[j]` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`.
5. `T` is `T + bets`.
6. `t` must be greater than `T + bets`.
7. `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
8. `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`.
9. `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.
10. `ans` contains the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space.
11. `l` is a non-empty list.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(-1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
- The value `-1` is a constant integer and will be printed as is.

### Output:
Output: **-1**
