Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is now `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers representing the converted input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and is now `T - 1`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, and `a[n-1]` is now `a[n-1] - mi`. Additionally, the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[n-1]`) is 0.**
