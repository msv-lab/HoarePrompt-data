Output State: **`func` is expected to take two parameters `a` and `b`, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `test` must be an integer such that 1 <= test <= 1000, `t` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers.**

The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, while the other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
