The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already a positive integer (n ≥ 1), the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` will start at 0, which is the default behavior of `range(n)`.

However, the state `first` is False and does not affect the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted. The list `arr` and the Counter object `mpp` are also not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted either.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (n ≥ 1), `i` is 0**
