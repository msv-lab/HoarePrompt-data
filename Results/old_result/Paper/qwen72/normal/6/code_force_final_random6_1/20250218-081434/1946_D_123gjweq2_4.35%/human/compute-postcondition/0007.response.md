Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is the result of `i` XOR `0`, `thing1` is 0.**

In natural language: The variable `xor` is updated to the result of the XOR operation between `i` (the first element in `cur_arr`) and `0`. Since `i` XOR `0` is equal to `i`, `xor` now holds the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
