Output State: **`n` and `m` are the new input integers, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `count` is 4, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (n / 3 - 2) / 3 + 1`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `n / 4`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `m` must be greater than or equal to 4.**

The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g` remain unchanged. The condition that `m` must be greater than or equal to 4 is still valid.
