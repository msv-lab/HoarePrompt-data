The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers, where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the list's length is between 1 and 200,000. It prints the first integer `i` in the range `[0, n]` that either appears exactly once in `arr` (if there are at least two such integers) or the first integer that does not appear in `arr` (if there are fewer than two integers that appear exactly once). If the loop completes without finding such an integer, it prints the last integer in the range `[0, n]` that has a frequency of 0 or 1. The function does not return any value.
