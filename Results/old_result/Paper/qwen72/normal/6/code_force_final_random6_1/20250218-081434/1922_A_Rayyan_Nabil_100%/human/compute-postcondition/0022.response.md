To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `results` is a list containing `t` results, where each result is the output of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration.
   - `result` is the first element of the `results` list.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(result)
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The variable `t` is an integer within the range from 1 to 1000.
   - The list `results` contains `t` elements, each of which is the result of calling the function `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.
   - The variable `result` is assigned the value of the first element in the `results` list, which is `results[0]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the value of `results[0]`.
   - Since `results[0]` is the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for the first iteration, the output will be the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for that specific call.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the result of the first call to `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.

Output: **result (where result is the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for the first iteration)**
