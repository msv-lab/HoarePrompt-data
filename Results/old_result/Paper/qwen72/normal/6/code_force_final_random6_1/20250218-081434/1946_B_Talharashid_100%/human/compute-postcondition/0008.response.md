Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`, and `ele` is a negative integer with `c` (which is 0) less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`.**

The code snippet `c = 0` does not change the value of `c` because it was already 0 in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
