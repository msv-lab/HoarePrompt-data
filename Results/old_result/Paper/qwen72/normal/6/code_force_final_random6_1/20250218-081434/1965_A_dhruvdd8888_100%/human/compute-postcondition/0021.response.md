Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has been modified such that each element `nums[i]` is reduced by the sum of all previous elements in the list, `nums` must have at least 3 elements, `ls` is equal to the sum of all elements in the modified `nums` list, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, `nw` is True, `cw` is True, and `nums[i]` is not equal to 1.**

The code snippet `cw = True` does not change the value of `cw` since it was already `True` in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
