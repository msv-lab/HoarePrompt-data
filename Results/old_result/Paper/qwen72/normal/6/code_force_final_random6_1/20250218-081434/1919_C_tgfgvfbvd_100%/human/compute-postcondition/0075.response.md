Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, and `x` is 2. If `l[2]` ≤ `a`, then `a` is `l[2]`, `b` retains its value, and `c` is 0, 1, or 2. If `l[1]` ≤ `a`, then `c` is 0 or 1. If `l[1]` > `a`, then `c` is 1 or 2. If `l[2]` > `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[2]`, and `b` retains its value. If `l[2]` > `b`, then `b` is updated to `l[2]`, and `c` is 1, 2, or 3. If `l[1]` ≤ `a`, then `c` is 1 or 2. If `l[1]` > `a`, then `c` is 2 or 3. If `a` > `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped, and `c` is 0, 1, or 2. If `l[1]` ≤ `a`, then `c` is 0 or 1. If `l[1]` > `a`, then `c` is 1 or 2.***
