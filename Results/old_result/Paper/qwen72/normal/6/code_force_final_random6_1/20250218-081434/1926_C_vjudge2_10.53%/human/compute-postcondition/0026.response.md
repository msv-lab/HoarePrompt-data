Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 3, `i` is 2, `values[1]` is 1, `sum_values[1]` is 1, `values[2]` is 2, `sum_values[2]` is 3.**

The value of `sum_values[2]` is now 3, as it has been assigned the value of `total`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
