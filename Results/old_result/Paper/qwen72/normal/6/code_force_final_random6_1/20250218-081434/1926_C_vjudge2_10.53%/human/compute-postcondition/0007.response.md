Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing the initial input integer `n` and the new input integer `n`, `n` is updated to a new input integer.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than or equal to 0, which remains unchanged.
- `numbers` is a list that initially contains the input integer `n`.
- The code `numbers.append(n)` adds the new input integer `n` to the list `numbers`.
- The value of `n` is updated to a new input integer, as specified in the initial state.
- Therefore, `numbers` now contains two elements: the initial input integer `n` and the new input integer `n`.
