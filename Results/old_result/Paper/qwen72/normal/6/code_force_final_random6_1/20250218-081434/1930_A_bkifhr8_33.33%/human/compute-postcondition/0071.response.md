Output State: **`t` is greater than 2n + 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block, `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers, the length of `lst` is the number of substrings in `l` separated by spaces minus 1, `l` is an input string, and the length of `lst` is not equal to 2. The second element (index 1) of `lst` has been removed.**

Explanation:
- The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 (since 1 * 2 = 2) from the list `lst`.
- The length of `lst` is now reduced by 1, but it still remains the number of substrings in `l` separated by spaces minus 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `ans_f`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `ans` and the exact length of `lst` are not altered by this code, but the list `lst` itself is modified by removing the element at index 2.
