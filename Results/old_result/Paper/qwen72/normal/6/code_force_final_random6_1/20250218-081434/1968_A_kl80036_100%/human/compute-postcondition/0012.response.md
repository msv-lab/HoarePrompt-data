Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is `t - 1`, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each of the t test cases, `y` is `x - 1` which is an integer such that 1 <= y <= 999 for each of the t test cases.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is only used to determine the number of iterations of the loop. It is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop has completed all its iterations, `i` will be `t - 1`. This is because `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration, so after `t` iterations, `i` will be `t - 1`.
- **`x`**: For each of the `t` test cases, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000. This is true for each iteration of the loop, and the loop does not modify `x` after it is read.
- **`y`**: For each of the `t` test cases, `y` is calculated as `x - 1`, so `y` will be an integer such that 1 <= y <= 999. This is true for each iteration of the loop, and `y` is recalculated for each new value of `x`.

This output state describes the final values of the variables after the loop has executed all `t` iterations.
