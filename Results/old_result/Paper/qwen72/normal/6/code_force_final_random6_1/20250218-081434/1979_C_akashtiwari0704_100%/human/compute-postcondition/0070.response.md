The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `bets`. If `bets` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `i` is used as the loop index, and it will start from 0 and go up to `bets - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `bets - 1`
- `bets` is an input integer greater than 0

To ensure the loop executes, `i` should start from 0, and `bets` must be greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `bets` must be greater than 0**
