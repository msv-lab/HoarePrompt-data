The function `func_1` should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `n` is the length of the array `a`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5. Each element `a_i` in the array `a` is an integer where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array `a` is beautiful in every test case, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5. The function returns the result based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of test cases `t`, the length of the array `n`, and the array `a` itself. It returns the result based on the input parameters, ensuring that the array `a` is beautiful in every test case and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**
