Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it calculates the bets. Specifically, the following issues can be identified:

1. **Multiplication of all `k` values**: The program multiplies all the `k` values together to get `m`. This is not the correct approach for determining the bets. The goal is to find bets such that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome, but multiplying all `k` values together can lead to an unnecessarily large `m`, which can cause the sum of bets to be greater than or equal to `m / hcf`.

2. **Incorrect HCF calculation**: The function `func_1` is used to calculate the HCF (Greatest Common Divisor) of the list `c`. However, the list `c` is calculated as `m / k[i]`, which is not the correct way to determine the bets. The bets should be determined based on the multipliers `k` in a way that ensures the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

3. **Sum check**: The program checks if `sum(c) >= m / hcf` and prints `-1` if this condition is true. However, this check is not always correct because the bets `c` are not calculated correctly in the first place.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
The correct output should be:
```
27 41 12
```
However, the program will calculate:
- `m = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42`
- `c = [42 / 3, 42 / 2, 42 / 7] = [14, 21, 6]`
- `hcf = gcd(14, 21, 6) = 1`
- `sum(c) = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41`
- `m / hcf = 42 / 1 = 42`

Since `sum(c) < m / hcf`, the program will print:
```
14 21 6
```
However, this is incorrect because:
- If the first outcome wins, you receive `3 * 14 = 42` coins.
- If the second outcome wins, you receive `2 * 21 = 42` coins.
- If the third outcome wins, you receive `7 * 6 = 42` coins.

In all cases, the return is equal to the total bet, not strictly greater. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
