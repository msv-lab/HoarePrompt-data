Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k` for each case. This is accurate and matches the problem description.

2. **Base Case Check**: The program checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If so, it prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with a price of 1 coin. This is correct because Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels from this single stall, spending `k` coins. This matches the problem's requirement and is a valid solution.

3. **Second Case Check**: The program checks if `n + 2 > k * 2`. This condition can be simplified to `n > 2k - 2`. If this condition is true, it prints "YES" and sets up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`. This is intended to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. However, the reasoning provided in the original assessment has a flaw:
   - Alice will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall with price `n - k + 1`. She will buy `k - 1` jewels from this stall, spending `(k - 1) * (n - k + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining coins will be `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1)`, which simplifies to `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1) = n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1) = n - (n - k + 1 - k + 1) = n - (n - 2k + 2) = 2k - 2`.
   - Since `n > 2k - 2`, Alice will have at least 1 coin left, which she will use to buy 1 more jewel from the second stall with price 1.
   - Therefore, Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels in total.

   However, the calculation `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1)` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be:
   - Alice buys `floor(n / (n - k + 1))` jewels from the first stall. If `n >= (k - 1) * (n - k + 1)`, she will buy `k - 1` jewels.
   - The remaining coins will be `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1)`, which should be `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1) = n - (n - k + 1 - k + 1) = n - (n - 2k + 2) = 2k - 2`.
   - If `n > 2k - 2`, then Alice will have at least 1 coin left, which she will use to buy 1 more jewel from the second stall with price 1.

   The condition `n + 2 > k * 2` is indeed sufficient to ensure that Alice can buy `k` jewels, but the original assessment's explanation of the calculation is flawed. The program still works correctly for this case.

4. **Third Case Check**: If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "NO". This is correct because:
   - If `n <= 2k - 2`, it means Alice does not have enough coins to buy `k` jewels even if she buys them greedily from two stalls with the optimal prices.
   - The program does not need to consider more than two stalls because the problem constraints allow for at most 60 stalls, and the conditions for two stalls are sufficient to determine if it is possible.

5. **Output Format**: The program correctly prints the required output format for each test case, including the "YES" or "NO" response, the number of stalls, and the prices of the stalls.

Despite the flaw in the original assessment's explanation of the second case, the program itself is correct and adheres to the problem constraints and requirements.

Final: **True**
