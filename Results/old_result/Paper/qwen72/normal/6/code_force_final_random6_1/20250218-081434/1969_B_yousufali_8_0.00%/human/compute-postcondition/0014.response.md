Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `n` is 0 or 1. If `s[1]` is 1, then `n` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `n` remains 0 or 1. If `s[1]` is 0 and `n` is not 0, `ans` is incremented by `n + 1`. If `s[1]` is not 0 or `n` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged.***
