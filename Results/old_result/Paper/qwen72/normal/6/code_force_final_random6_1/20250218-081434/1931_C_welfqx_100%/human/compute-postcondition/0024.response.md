Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1 if all elements in `num` are equal, otherwise `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is `n-2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where the first inequality was found, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`.**
