The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the input integer that defines the range. We need to adjust the state of `i` for the loop to execute one more time. The input integer that defines the range remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. The input integer that defines the range must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x â‰  y, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, and `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, the program retains these conditions. If `k` is not a power of 2, and `n` is 0 with `m` being an odd or even integer greater than 0, the program retains these conditions. Otherwise, `l` is a string representing the binary form of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the string `l`, and `q` is 2 raised to the power of `p - 1`. The input integer defining the range must be greater than 0.**
