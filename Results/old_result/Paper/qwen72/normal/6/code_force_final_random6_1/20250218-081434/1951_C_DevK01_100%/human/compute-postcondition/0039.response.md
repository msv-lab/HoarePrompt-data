The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t` and the current value of `_`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 1, and `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than `_`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input provided by the user, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second integer in `L` and the third integer in `L`, `k` is the third integer in `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. If `n * m` is equal to `k`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of the sorted `M`, and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is a list containing the first `q - 1` elements of the sorted `M`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `cost` is updated to `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`, and `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**
