The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, which is derived from the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element. The other variables mentioned in the state (`test_cases`, `(n, x, y, arr)`, `results`, `count`, `mod_x_map`, `mod_y_map`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the purpose of the loop execution.

Given that `arr` is part of the first tuple in `test_cases`, and `test_cases` is guaranteed to have at least one tuple, the loop will execute if `arr` in the first tuple has at least one element.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `arr` has at least one element. The state of `num` will be the first element of `arr` at the start of the loop.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary**
