### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is called without any arguments, but it should take a binary string `s` as input. However, the function reads the input directly within its body, which is a common practice in competitive programming. This is not incorrect, but it could be more modular if the function took `s` as an argument.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case, reading the binary string `s` for each test case.

2. **Binary String Conversion:**
   - The binary string `s` is converted to a list of integers. This is correct because it allows for easier manipulation of the string characters as integers.

3. **Counting Zeroes:**
   - The variable `zeroes` is correctly initialized to count the number of zeros in the string `s`.

4. **Counting and Cost Calculation:**
   - The variable `cnt` is initialized as a list `[0, 0]` to keep track of the number of zeros and ones encountered so far.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to zero and is used to accumulate the total cost of sorting the string.
   - The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - If `c` is 0, it checks if there are any ones (`cnt[1] > 0`). If there are, it adds 1 to `ans` because a 0 followed by a 1 requires a cyclic shift to move the 1 to the correct position.
     - If `c` is 1, it adds the number of remaining zeros (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans` because each 1 that appears before a 0 requires a cyclic shift to move the 1 to the correct position.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the total cost `ans` for each test case, which is the correct output format.

### Correctness:

The program correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order. The logic for counting the number of required cyclic shifts is sound and matches the problem description. The program handles the input and output as expected and works for the provided test cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
