Let's break down the task step by step based on the initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `_` is a placeholder variable incremented by 1.
- `n` and `k` are the first and second integers in the input line, respectively.
- If `n` is equal to `k`, the current values of `n` and `k` remain equal.
- If `n` is not equal to `k`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` or `n + 2 <= k * 2` holds, depending on the values of `n` and `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions**:
   - `n` and `k` are integers.
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n - k` is 0.
   - If `n` is not equal to `k`, we need to consider the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` or `n + 2 <= k * 2`.

2. **Expression Evaluation**:
   - The expression `n - k + 1` will be evaluated and printed.
   - If `n == k`, then `n - k + 1` simplifies to `0 + 1 = 1`.
   - If `n != k`, we need to evaluate the condition:
     - If `n + 2 > k * 2`, then `n > 2k - 2`.
     - If `n + 2 <= k * 2`, then `n <= 2k - 2`.

3. **Possible Values**:
   - If `n == k`, the output will be `1`.
   - If `n != k`, the output will be `n - k + 1`, which can vary depending on the values of `n` and `k`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of `n - k + 1` followed by a space. The exact value of `n - k + 1` depends on the values of `n` and `k`:
- If `n == k`, the output will be `1`.
- If `n != k`, the output will be `n - k + 1`, where `n` and `k` are the first and second integers in the input line, respectively.

Output: **1 (if n == k) or n - k + 1 (if n != k) (where n and k are the first and second integers in the input line, respectively)**
