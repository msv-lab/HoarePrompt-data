Output State: **`x` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers based on the new input, `lst[a]` is a list that includes `b` as its last element twice, `lst[b]` is a list that includes `a` as its last element twice.**

Explanation: The code `lst[a].append(b)` appends the integer `b` to the list `lst[a]`. Since `lst[a]` initially included `b` as its last element, after the code execution, `lst[a]` now includes `b` as its last element twice. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
