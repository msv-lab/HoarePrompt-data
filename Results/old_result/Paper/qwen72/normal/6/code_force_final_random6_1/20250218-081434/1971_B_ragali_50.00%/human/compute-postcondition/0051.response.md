Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed.
   - `i` is the last character of `s`.
   - `a` is a set that contains all unique characters from `s`.
   - The set `a` contains exactly one unique character.

2. **Implications:**
   - Since `a` contains exactly one unique character, it means that all characters in the string `s` are the same.
   - Therefore, `s` must be a string where every character is the same.
   - `i`, being the last character of `s`, will be the same as any other character in `s`.

3. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('NO')
   ```

4. **Explanation:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'NO'`.
   - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.
   - Therefore, the output will be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
