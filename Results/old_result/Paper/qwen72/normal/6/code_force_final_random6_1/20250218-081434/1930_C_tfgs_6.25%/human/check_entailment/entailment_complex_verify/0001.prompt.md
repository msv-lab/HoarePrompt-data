You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    3
    
    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the user. It modifies each element of `a` by adding `i + 1` to `a[i]` for all `0 ≤ i < n`. Then, it generates a new list `ans` that contains all unique elements from the modified `a` in descending order, along with additional integers that are the largest possible values that can be inserted between these unique elements without violating the uniqueness and descending order. If there are still remaining positions to fill, it appends the largest possible integers that are one less than the previous element, ensuring the final length of `ans` is `n`. The function prints the elements of `ans` in a single line separated by spaces.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Array Transformation:**
   - The program modifies each element of the array `a` by adding the index `i + 1` to `a[i]`. This step is correct as it follows the problem description where `a_i + i` is inserted into the set `S`.

3. **Counting and Removing Duplicates:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the modified array `a`.
   - It then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts the set in descending order. This step is correct as it ensures that the elements in `S` are unique and sorted in decreasing order.

4. **Constructing the Lexicographically Largest Array `b`:**
   - The program initializes a list `ans` to store the elements of the final array `b`.
   - It iterates over the sorted unique elements of `a` and constructs the array `b` by:
     - Adding the maximum number of elements between the current and previous elements that can be added without exceeding the count of the previous element.
     - Appending the current element to `ans`.
     - Decreasing the count of the current element in the `Counter`.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - After the main loop, if there are any remaining elements to be added (tracked by `cnt`), the program appends the smallest possible elements to `ans` to ensure the array is of the correct length.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` for each test case, which is the lexicographically largest array `b`.

### Correctness:
The program appears to follow the problem description and correctly constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` by ensuring that the elements are unique and sorted in descending order. The use of the `Counter` and the logic to handle duplicates and remaining elements is sound.

However, there is a potential issue in the logic for handling duplicates and remaining elements. Specifically, the program might not always produce the lexicographically largest array `b` due to the way it handles the gaps between elements.

### Example Analysis:
- **First Test Case:**
  - Input: `2 2 1`
  - Modified `a`: `[3, 2]`
  - Set `S`: `{3, 2}`
  - Sorted `S`: `[3, 2]`
  - Output: `3 2`
  - This is correct.

- **Second Test Case:**
  - Input: `5 1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000`
  - Modified `a`: `[2, 101, 1002, 1000001, 1000000001]`
  - Set `S`: `{1000000001, 1000001, 1002, 101, 2}`
  - Sorted `S`: `[1000000001, 1000001, 1002, 101, 2]`
  - Output: `1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2`
  - This is correct.

- **Third Test Case:**
  - Input: `3 6 4 8`
  - Modified `a`: `[7, 6, 11]`
  - Set `S`: `{11, 7, 6}`
  - Sorted `S`: `[11, 7, 6]`
  - Output: `11 7 6`
  - This is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the given problem and produces the lexicographically largest array `b` for the provided test cases. However, the logic for handling duplicates and remaining elements might need further review to ensure it always produces the correct result.
