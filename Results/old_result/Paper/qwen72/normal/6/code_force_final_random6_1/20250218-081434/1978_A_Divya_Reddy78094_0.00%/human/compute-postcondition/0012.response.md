Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order**

The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to the integer input provided by the user. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n` while maintaining the initial conditions for `t`, `_`, and `nums`.
