The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c` and the list `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `s`. If `s` has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute again for the second integer in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string that must have at least one integer, `c` is the first integer in `s`, `cnt` is [1, 0] if `c` is 0, or [0, 1] if `c` is 1, and `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 2 integers, and `c` will be the second integer in `s`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string that must have at least 2 integers, `c` is the second integer in `s`, `cnt` is [1, 0] if the first integer in `s` is 0, or [0, 1] if the first integer in `s` is 1, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`**.
