Postcondition: ***`ii` is 2, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `t` is the new input string, `l` is the number of times 'L' appears in the new `t`, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is -1, `y` is a list of `n` integers where each element is updated to `k` based on the loop. If `t[-1]` is 'L', `q1` is `l - 2`, `q2` is `l`, and `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`. Otherwise, `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l + 1`, and `k` is `a[l] % m`.***
