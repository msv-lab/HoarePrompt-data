Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least 3 elements, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`, `i` is `i + 1`, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is `counter[a[i - 1]] - adv`, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - adv`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - 1, a[i - 1] - 2, ..., a[i - 1] - adv, a[i]`, `j` is `adv - 1`, `counter[a[i]]` is `counter[a[i]] - 1`, `adv` must be greater than 0, `ans` has `adv` new elements: `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - adv`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`. If `i` > 0, `i` is incremented by `adv`, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decremented by `2 * adv`, `cnt` is decremented by `total_adv + adv`, `adv` is updated to `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])`, and `ans` has `total_adv` new elements: `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - adv`, where `total_adv` is the sum of all `adv` values from each iteration. `ans` now has `a[i]` appended to it.**
