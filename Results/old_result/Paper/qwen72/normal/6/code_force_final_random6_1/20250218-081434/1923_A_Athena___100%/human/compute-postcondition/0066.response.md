Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `res` is 0, `t` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed, `n` is an input integer**

Explanation:
- The first element of the list `a` (which was 0) is removed by the `pop(0)` operation.
- The length of `a` is now reduced by 1, so `i` is still `len(a) - 1`, but the new length of `a` is one less than before.
- The values of `res`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.
