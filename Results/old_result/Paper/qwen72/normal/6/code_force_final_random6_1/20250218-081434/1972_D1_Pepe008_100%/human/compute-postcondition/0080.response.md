The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function requires two positive integers, `n` and `m`, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the example. Without further details on the output, we can only describe the input parameters and the general context.

Functionality: **The function implicitly accepts two positive integers, `n` and `m`, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and returns a value based on these inputs.**
