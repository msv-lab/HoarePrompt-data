Output State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt[a[1]]` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt[a[1]]` by 1, since `i` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial state is updated to reflect this change.
