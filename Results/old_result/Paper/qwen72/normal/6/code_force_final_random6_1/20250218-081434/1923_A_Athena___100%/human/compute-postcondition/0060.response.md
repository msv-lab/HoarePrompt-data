Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a non-empty list.
   - `i` is `len(a) - 1`, which means `i` is the index of the last element in the list `a`.
   - `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(res)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `res` is defined as the number of zeros in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` is a non-empty list, `res` will be a non-negative integer representing the count of zeros in `a`.
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `res`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be the number of zeros in the list `a`.

Output: **res (where res is the number of zeros in the list `a`)**
