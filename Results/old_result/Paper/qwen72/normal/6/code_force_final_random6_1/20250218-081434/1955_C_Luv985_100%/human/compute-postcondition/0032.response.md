Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the converted input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and is now `T - 1`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0 or 1, and `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is now `n - 2` and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 and `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - mi`. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is updated to `k % 2`, and if `a[l] - t - k // 2` is 0, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
