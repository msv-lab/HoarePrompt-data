Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is the last element in `res` + 1, `k` is `2 * k - ul`, `res` is a non-empty list that has been fully iterated, `ul` is not equal to `ur` unless the condition `ul == ur` is met. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `ul` is not equal to `ur`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` remains 2. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is not 2, `r[a[i] - 1]` remains 0, and if `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `ur` is `ur + 2`. If `ul == ur`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
