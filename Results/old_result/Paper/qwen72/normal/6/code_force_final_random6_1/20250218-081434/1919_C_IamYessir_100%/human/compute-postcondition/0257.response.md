Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element. If `b` is an empty list, `x` and `y` are both set to positive infinity. Otherwise, `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, and if `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to positive infinity; otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`. Additionally, `y` is less than `lit[i]`. The current value of `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `x`. `b` now contains the first element of `lit`.**
