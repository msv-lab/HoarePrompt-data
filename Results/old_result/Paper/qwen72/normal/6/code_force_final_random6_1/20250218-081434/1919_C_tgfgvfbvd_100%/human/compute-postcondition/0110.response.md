Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 2, `b` is set to the value of `l[2]`, and if `a` > `b`, then `a` is set to the previous value of `b`, `b` is set to the previous value of `a`, and `c` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.**
