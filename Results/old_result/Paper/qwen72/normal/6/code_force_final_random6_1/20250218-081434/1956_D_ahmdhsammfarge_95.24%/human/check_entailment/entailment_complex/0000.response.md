### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of an array `a` by performing a specific operation no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) times.
   - The operation involves choosing a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the set.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(lst)`**:
     - This function is intended to find the subarray that, when replaced with its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array.
     - It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential new sum if the subarray is replaced with its MEX.
     - The function returns the indices `r` and `l` of the subarray that maximizes the sum.
     - **Correctness**: The function correctly identifies the subarray that maximizes the sum, but it does not compute the MEX of the subarray. Instead, it assumes that the MEX is the length of the subarray, which is not always correct. However, for the purpose of maximizing the sum, this assumption is valid because the MEX of any subarray will be at most the length of the subarray.

   - **`func_2(r, l, ops)`**:
     - This function is a recursive function that appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list.
     - It ensures that the operation is performed for all valid subarrays.
     - **Correctness**: The function correctly appends the operation to the `ops` list, but it does so in a redundant manner by appending the same operation multiple times. This is not necessary for the problem, but it does not violate the constraint of performing no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.

   - **`func_3(r, l, lst, ops)`**:
     - This function performs the operation on the subarray `lst[r:l + 1]` and updates the list `ops` with the operation.
     - It appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` multiple times, which is redundant.
     - It then sets all elements in the subarray `lst[r:l + 1]` to the length of the subarray `n`.
     - **Correctness**: The function correctly updates the array and the operations list. However, it appends the operation multiple times, which is not necessary but does not violate the problem constraints.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic repeatedly calls `func_1` to find the optimal subarray and `func_3` to perform the operation.
   - After the loop, it tries to replace all zeros in the array with ones, which is a valid operation to maximize the sum.
   - **Correctness**: The main logic correctly maximizes the sum of the array and constructs a sequence of operations that achieves this sum. The number of operations is within the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in terms of achieving the goal of maximizing the sum of the array and constructing a sequence of operations that achieves this sum. The redundancy in appending operations multiple times does not affect the correctness of the solution, as it still meets the problem constraints.

**Correctness: **True****
