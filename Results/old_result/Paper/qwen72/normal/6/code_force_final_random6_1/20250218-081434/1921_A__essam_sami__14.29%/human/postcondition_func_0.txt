The function reads a series of test cases from user input, where each test case consists of four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates two distances: `n` between the first and third points, and `x` between the second and fourth points. It then prints the smaller of these two distances for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being an integer between 1 and 100, `steps` being `t-1`, and the last set of input coordinates being stored in `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h`. The final state includes the printed results for each test case.
