The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` 2, and `x` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `s` is 1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1) + (1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1**
