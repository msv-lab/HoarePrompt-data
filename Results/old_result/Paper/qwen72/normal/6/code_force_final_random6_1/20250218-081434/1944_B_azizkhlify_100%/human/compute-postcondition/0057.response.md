To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step:

Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.

Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. The code snippet contains a `print` statement that prints the element at index `i` of the list `a`.
2. The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.
3. From the initial state, we know that `i` is 1.
4. However, the list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. We only know that `a` is a list, and `i` is 1, which means the code will print the element at index 1 of the list `a`.

Since the list `a` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[1]`. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list `a`)**
