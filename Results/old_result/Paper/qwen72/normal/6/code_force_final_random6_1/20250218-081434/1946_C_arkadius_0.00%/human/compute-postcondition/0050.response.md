Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `v` is the last vertex in the stack, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been updated to its previous value plus `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is now `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` + `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**
