Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `l[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `r[a[n] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is `n + 1`. This means `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is incremented by 1. The other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
