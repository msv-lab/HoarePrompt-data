To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is 0.
2. `idx` is `len(data)`, which means `idx` is the length of the list `data`.
3. `data` is a list of strings.
4. `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` for each iteration of the loop.
5. `n` is the last value of `n` processed.
6. `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, with each element at index `x` incremented by the number of times `x` appears in the corresponding segment of `data`.
7. `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`.
8. `i` is `n`.
9. `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`.
10. `ans` is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triplets of elements in `v` that are greater than or equal to 2 and 3, respectively.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`results` List**: The `results` list contains the string representation of `ans` for each iteration of the loop. The exact number of iterations and the values of `ans` in each iteration are not explicitly provided, but we know that `results` is a list of strings.
2. **`ans` Calculation**: `ans` is calculated based on the elements in the list `v`. Specifically, it is the sum of all combinations of pairs and triplets of elements in `v` that are greater than or equal to 2 and 3, respectively. The exact value of `ans` depends on the values in `v`, which in turn depend on the values in `data` and the value of `n`.
3. **`v` List**: `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, where each element at index `x` is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in the corresponding segment of `data`. The exact values in `v` depend on the values in `data` and the value of `n`.
4. **`cnt` Calculation**: `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`. This is a straightforward sum of the elements in `v`.
5. **`i` and `x`**: `i` is set to `n`, and `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`. Since `idx` is `len(data)`, `x` is the integer value of the last element in `data`.

### Output Determination:
- The `print` statement will join all the strings in the `results` list with a newline character (`\n`) and print the resulting string.
- Each string in `results` represents the value of `ans` for a specific iteration of the loop.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `ans` in each iteration are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the structure of the `results` list.

Output: **[ans1]
[ans2]
...
[ansN] (where each [ansX] is the string representation of the value of `ans` for each iteration of the loop)**
