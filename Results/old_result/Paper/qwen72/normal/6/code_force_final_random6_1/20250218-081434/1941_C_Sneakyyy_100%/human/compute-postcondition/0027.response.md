The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop control variable used in `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This loop iterates a fixed number of times based on the input provided by `int(input())`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (this is the number of iterations the outer loop will run).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input string.
- `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`.
- `i` is the length of `a` minus 2 or the index just after the last processed character that was part of a 'map' or 'pie' substring.

For the loop to execute one more time, the loop control variable `_` must be incremented by 1, and the loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than the value provided by `int(input())`.

Since `_` is not explicitly mentioned in the state, we can infer that it is incremented by the loop mechanism itself. The loop will execute again if `_` is still less than the value provided by `int(input())`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, and `i` is the length of `a` minus 2 or the index just after the last processed character that was part of a 'map' or 'pie' substring. The loop control variable `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())` for the loop to execute again.**

However, since the loop control variable `_` is not explicitly part of the state, we can keep the state as it is, with the understanding that `_` is incremented by the loop mechanism:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, and `i` is the length of `a` minus 2 or the index just after the last processed character that was part of a 'map' or 'pie' substring.**
