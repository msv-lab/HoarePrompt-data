Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it only considers subarrays of length 3, which is insufficient to find the maximum possible value that the array can be transformed into. According to the problem description, Mocha can choose any subarray of length 2 or more, and the median of that subarray can be used to transform the array. The program fails to consider subarrays of different lengths, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The program will output `3`, but the correct answer is `4` as shown in the problem description. The program only checks subarrays of length 3, missing the possibility of choosing subarrays of length 2 or more, which can result in a higher median value.
