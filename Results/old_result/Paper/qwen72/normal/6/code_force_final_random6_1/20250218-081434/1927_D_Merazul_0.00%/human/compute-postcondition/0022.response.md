The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `k`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- If `u` is `True` or `v` is `False`, `n` remains unchanged.
- If `u` is `False` and `v` is `True`, `n` is decremented by 1.

However, the loop head does not depend on `u`, `v`, or `n`. It only depends on `i` and `k`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `k` must be such that `i` is still within the range `1` to `k + 1`.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is `k + 1`.
- For the loop to execute again, `k + 1` must be less than or equal to `k + 1`.

However, since `i` is now `k + 1`, the loop will not execute again unless `k` is incremented. But since `k` is not modified in the given state, the loop will not execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `k` remains unchanged**
