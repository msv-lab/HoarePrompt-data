Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of integers, `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing the range of an operation. The minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is not 0, and `ops` now includes the additional inner list `[r + 1, l + 1]`.**
