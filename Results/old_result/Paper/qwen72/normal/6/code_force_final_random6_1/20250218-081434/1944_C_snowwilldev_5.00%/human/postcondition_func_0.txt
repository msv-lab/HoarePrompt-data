The function `func` handles multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of size `n`. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each element in `a` and prints the first index `i` where the count of `i` is 1 or where the count of `i` is 0. If no such index is found, it prints the last index `N-1`. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.
