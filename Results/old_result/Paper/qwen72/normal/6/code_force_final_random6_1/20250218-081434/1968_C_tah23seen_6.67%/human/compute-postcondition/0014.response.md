Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros with `ans[0]` now equal to `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` now equal to `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`, and `ans[i + 1]` is updated to `arr[i] + ans[i]` where `i` is `n - 2`.** 

The value of `ans[i + 1]` is now `arr[i] + ans[i]`, where `i` is `n - 2`. All other conditions and values from the initial state remain unchanged.
