Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `lst[x]` is not an empty list, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged from their initial values, `s` is now `not s`
Code of the loop:
while lst[x]:
    y = lst[x].pop()
    if lst[y] != []:
        x = y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`lst[x]` is a list with one less element than before, `y` is the last element that was removed from `lst[x]`, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged, `s` is `not s`. If `lst[y]` is a non-empty list, `x` is now equal to `y`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `x` and the program flow remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`lst[x]` is a non-empty list with its last element removed, `y` is the last element that was removed from `lst[x]`, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged, `s` is `not s`. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, `x` is now equal to `y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`lst[x]` is a non-empty list with one less element than before, `y` is the last element that was removed from `lst[x]`, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged, `s` is `not s`. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, `x` is now equal to `y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `x` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
