Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `arr` must have at least three elements, `c` is 2, and `ans` now contains the value `1 << i` appended to its previous contents. If `c` == `n - 1`, `ans` also contains `k0 - sum(ans)` appended to it, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
