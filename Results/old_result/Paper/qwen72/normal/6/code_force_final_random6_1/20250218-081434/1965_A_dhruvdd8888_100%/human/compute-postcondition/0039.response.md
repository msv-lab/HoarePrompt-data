Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has been modified such that each element `nums[i]` is reduced by the sum of all previous elements in the list, `ls` is equal to the sum of all elements in the modified `nums` list, `i` is 1, `nw` is the same as the value of `cw` after the last iteration, and `cw` is the same as the value of `nw` after the last iteration. If `cw` is true, `cw` remains true. If `cw` is false, `cw` remains false.***
