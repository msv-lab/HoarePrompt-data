Postcondition: **`_` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0, and `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`. If `dif` is not 0, then: if `k` is 0, `res` is `n - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is the second element of `a`, `k` is updated to `k - dif`, and `res` is `n - 2`; if `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is the first element of `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, `k` is set to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 2`.**
