The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than the length of `arr`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `arr` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `arr` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is [arr[1], 1] if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is [arr[1], 1, 0] if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `arr[1]`, otherwise it is [0, 0, -1]**

Note: The state of `new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `segments_variants` are kept as they were at the end of the previous iteration because they are not part of the loop head and thus are not adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
