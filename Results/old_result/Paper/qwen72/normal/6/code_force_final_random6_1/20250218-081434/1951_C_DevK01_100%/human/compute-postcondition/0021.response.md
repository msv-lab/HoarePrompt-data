The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute one more time if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is 0. Since `_` is a throwaway variable and its value is not used, it will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1 after the increment of `_`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a list of integers converted from the input provided by the user and sorted in ascending order, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second and third integers in `L`, `k` is the third integer in `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `cost` is either `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m` is equal to `k`, or `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu` if `n * m` is not equal to `k`, where `w` is the last element of the original `N` and `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**
