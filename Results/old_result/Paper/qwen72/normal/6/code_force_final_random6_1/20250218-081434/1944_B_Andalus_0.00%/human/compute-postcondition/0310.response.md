To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Input and List Initialization:**
   - `n` and `k` are input integers.
   - `lst` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
   - `rgt` is the elements from `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order.

2. **List Creation:**
   - `ldb` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element.
   - `rdb` is a list containing all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element.
   - `sng` is a list containing all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next element (excluding the first and last elements of `lft`).

3. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `elem` is the second element in `sng`.
   - `sz` is the minimum of `k` and `2 * len(ldb)` plus 1.
   - The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the second element in the `sng` list.
   - Since `sng` must have at least 2 elements, `elem` will be a valid element from `sng`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be the second element in the `sng` list. The exact value of `elem` depends on the specific elements in `lst` and how they are sorted and filtered to form `sng`.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the second element in the sng list, and sng is a list containing all elements from lft that are not equal to their previous or next element, excluding the first and last elements of lft)**
