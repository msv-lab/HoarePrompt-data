The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters based on the provided function signature. However, given the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function might internally use or generate values for `t`, `x`, and `y` where `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `x` and `y` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, with digits from 1 to 9. The function's output is not specified, so it's unclear what it returns. 

Without additional context or the function body, we can only infer that the function likely processes these values in some way, but the exact return value or values cannot be determined from the given information.

Functionality: **The function processes values `t`, `x`, and `y` where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `x` and `y` are integers between 1 and 10^100, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. The exact return value or values are not specified.**
