Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`, `c` is increased by the value of `ele`.**

Explanation: The value of `c` is incremented by the value of `ele`, which is the second element in the list `l`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
