Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string.**

The value of `n` is updated to a new input integer, while the other variables (`t`, `results`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `c`) retain their previous values or conditions.
