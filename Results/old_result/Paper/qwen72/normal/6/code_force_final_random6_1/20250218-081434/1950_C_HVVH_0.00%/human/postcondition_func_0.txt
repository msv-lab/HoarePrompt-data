The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, then for `n` times, it reads a time in the format "hh:mm" from the user, converts the 24-hour format to a 12-hour format, and prints the converted time along with the appropriate AM/PM indicator. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the program state is unchanged except for the printed output.
