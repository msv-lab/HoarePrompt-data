### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and the function summary to evaluate its correctness.

1. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` processes `n` binary strings.
   - For each string, it converts the string into a list of integers.
   - It initializes `zeroes` to count the number of 0s in the string.
   - It initializes `cnt` as a list with two elements to keep track of the counts of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.
   - It iterates through each character in the string:
     - If the character is 0, it adds 1 to `ans` if there are any 1s before it.
     - If the character is 1, it adds the number of 0s that have not been encountered yet to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans` for each binary string.

2. **Logic Evaluation:**
   - The program aims to count the number of 1s that appear after each 0 and the number of 0s that appear after each 1.
   - This approach is based on the idea that each 1 that appears after a 0 and each 0 that appears after a 1 contributes to the cost of sorting the string.
   - However, the program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for all cases.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the string "101011":
     - The program correctly outputs 5.
     - The correct sequence of operations to sort the string is:
       - Choose substring [1, 2]: 101011 → 011011 (cost = 2)
       - Choose substring [3, 4]: 011011 → 010111 (cost = 2)
       - Choose substring [4, 6]: 010111 → 001111 (cost = 3)
     - Total cost = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.
   - For the string "01101001":
     - The program outputs 11, which is incorrect.
     - The correct sequence of operations to sort the string is:
       - Choose substring [2, 7]: 01101001 → 00001111 (cost = 6)
     - Total cost = 6.
     - The program's logic incorrectly counts the transitions, leading to an overestimation of the cost.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves finding the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to move all '1's to the right of all '0's.
   - This can be done by counting the number of '1's that need to be moved past '0's to achieve a sorted string.
   - The correct cost can be computed by finding the minimum cost of cyclic shifts for each possible starting position of the string.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The logic in the program leads to incorrect results for some cases, as demonstrated by the example "01101001".

Final: **False**
