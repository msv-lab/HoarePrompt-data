The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`. The loop can execute one more time if `t` is greater than the current value of `_`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `_` is a placeholder variable that increments by 1 with each iteration.

Since `_` is a placeholder and not used in the loop body, it is incremented automatically by the `range(t)` function. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `_` is a placeholder variable incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string that holds the user input after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a string that holds the new user input after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is a string that holds the latest user input after stripping leading and trailing whitespace.**

Simplified:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string.**
