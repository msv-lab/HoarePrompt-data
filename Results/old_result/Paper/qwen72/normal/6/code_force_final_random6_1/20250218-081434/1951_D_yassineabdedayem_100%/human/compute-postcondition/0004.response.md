Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `_` is a placeholder variable, which means it is not used in the code.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the standard input.
- `n` and `k` are the first and second integers in the input line, respectively.
- The current values of `n` and `k` are equal.

Given this information, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` to the console. The values of `n` and `k` being equal does not affect the output of this specific `print` statement, as it is simply printing a constant string.

Output: **YES**
