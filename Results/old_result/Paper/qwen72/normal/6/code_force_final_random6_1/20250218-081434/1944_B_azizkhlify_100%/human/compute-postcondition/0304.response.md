The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n` and `2 * n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `n + 1`, and `n` must still be such that `2 * n` is greater than `n + 1`.

State: **`res` is a list with all elements that satisfy `l[a[j] - 1] == 1` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ul` is not equal to `ur`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `ur` is increased by 2 and the current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0.**
