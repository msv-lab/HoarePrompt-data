Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` and `q` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains two integers provided by the user, `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, `_` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `queries = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `queries`.
- The initial state specifies that `queries` is a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user. After executing the code, `queries` is updated to a list of `q` positive integers provided by the user.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, `result`, `_`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their initial states remain unchanged.
