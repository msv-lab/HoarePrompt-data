The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. 

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that \(1 \le k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\).
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \le a_i \le 10^6\).
  - `b` is a list of `m` integers where \(1 \le b_i \le 10^6\).

The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

The function returns a list of results, one for each test case. Each result is determined based on the relationship between the lists `a` and `b` and the integer `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists `a` and `b` of integers. It returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `k`.**
