The provided code snippet consists of comments and does not contain any executable Python code. Therefore, the values of the variables and the state of the program remain unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^{15}, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.**
