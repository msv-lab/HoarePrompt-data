Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a new input string, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`, `i` is `len(a) - 2` or `len(a) - 1`, and `ans` is the total number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10,000, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains a new input integer, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `a` remains the input string, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `_` is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs, and it must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`, as it is not directly affected by the loop but is part of the overall execution context.
- The variable `i` will be either `len(a) - 2` or `len(a) - 1` after the loop has finished executing. This is because the loop increments `i` by 1 or 3 based on whether the substring `s` is 'map' or 'pie', and the loop stops when `i` is no longer less than `len(a) - 2`.
- The variable `ans` will be the total number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`. Each time the loop finds one of these substrings, `ans` is incremented by 1.
