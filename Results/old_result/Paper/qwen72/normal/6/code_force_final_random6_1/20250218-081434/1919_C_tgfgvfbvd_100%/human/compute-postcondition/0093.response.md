Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is `l[x]`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `c` is 0, `x` is 0, and `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is updated to `l[x]`.
- The value of `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b` before the assignment, but after the assignment, `a` is now equal to `l[x]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `b`, `c`, and `x` remain unchanged.
