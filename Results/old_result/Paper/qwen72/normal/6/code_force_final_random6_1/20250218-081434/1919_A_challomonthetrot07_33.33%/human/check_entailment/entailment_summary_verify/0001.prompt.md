You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `T` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where `1 <= T <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, where `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`. It then determines and prints the winner ('Alice' or 'Bob') based on the following rules: If `a` is equal to `b`, 'Bob' wins. If `a` is 1, 'Alice' wins. If `b` is 1, 'Bob' wins. If `a` is odd, 'Bob' wins. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, 'Alice' wins. If `a` is greater than `b`, 'Bob' wins. Otherwise, 'Alice' wins. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is unchanged except for the output printed to the console.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game where they can either swap wallets or keep their own, followed by removing one coin from the current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., the wallet is empty) loses.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best move to avoid losing.

2. **Analyzing the Conditions:**
   - **Case 1: \( a = b \)**
     - If both players have the same number of coins, the game will always end in a draw if they play optimally. However, since the game must have a winner, the player who starts (Alice) will eventually be forced to make a move that leaves the wallets in a state where the other player can win. Therefore, Bob wins.
   - **Case 2: \( a = 1 \)**
     - If Alice has only 1 coin, she will be forced to remove it on her first turn, leaving her wallet empty. Bob will then win.
   - **Case 3: \( b = 1 \)**
     - If Bob has only 1 coin, Alice can swap wallets with Bob on her first turn, leaving Bob with 1 coin. Bob will then be forced to remove it, leaving his wallet empty, and Alice will win.
   - **Case 4: \( a \% 2 == 1 \)**
     - If Alice has an odd number of coins, she can always force Bob to have an even number of coins by swapping and removing coins optimally. This ensures that Bob will eventually be forced to make a move that leaves him with an empty wallet, making Alice the winner.
   - **Case 5: \( a \% 2 == 0 \) and \( b \% 2 == 1 \)**
     - If Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins, Alice can always force Bob to have an even number of coins by swapping and removing coins optimally. This ensures that Bob will eventually be forced to make a move that leaves him with an empty wallet, making Alice the winner.
   - **Case 6: \( a > b \)**
     - If Alice has more coins than Bob, she can always force Bob to have fewer coins by swapping and removing coins optimally. This ensures that Bob will eventually be forced to make a move that leaves him with an empty wallet, making Alice the winner.
   - **Case 7: \( a < b \)**
     - If Bob has more coins than Alice, Bob can always force Alice to have fewer coins by swapping and removing coins optimally. This ensures that Alice will eventually be forced to make a move that leaves her with an empty wallet, making Bob the winner.

3. **Reviewing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( T \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins \( a \) and \( b \) in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It then checks the conditions in the order specified:
     - If \( a = b \), Bob wins.
     - If \( a = 1 \), Alice wins.
     - If \( b = 1 \), Bob wins.
     - If \( a \% 2 == 1 \), Bob wins.
     - If \( a \% 2 == 0 \) and \( b \% 2 == 1 \), Alice wins.
     - If \( a > b \), Bob wins.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, Alice wins.

4. **Identifying the Error:**
   - The program has a logical error in the conditions. Specifically, the condition `elif a % 2 == 1` is incorrect. If Alice has an odd number of coins, she can always force Bob to have an even number of coins, making Alice the winner, not Bob.
   - The correct condition should be `elif a % 2 == 1: print('Alice')`.

5. **Corrected Program:**
   ```python
   def func():
       T = int(input())
       for i in range(T):
           (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
           if a == b:
               print('Bob')
           elif a == 1:
               print('Alice')
           elif b == 1:
               print('Bob')
           elif a % 2 == 1:
               print('Alice')
           elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
               print('Alice')
           elif a > b:
               print('Bob')
           else:
               print('Alice')
   ```

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program contains a logical error in the condition `elif a % 2 == 1`, which incorrectly states that Bob wins when Alice has an odd number of coins. The correct condition should be `print('Alice')` in this case.
