Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem of counting the number of ways to choose 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The logic in the program is flawed because it only counts the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length or 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length. However, it does not consider the possibility of forming a triangle with three different lengths of sticks.

To form a non-degenerate triangle with sticks of lengths \(2^{a_i}\), \(2^{a_j}\), and \(2^{a_k}\), the triangle inequality must hold:
- \(2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}\)
- \(2^{a_i} + 2^{a_k} > 2^{a_j}\)
- \(2^{a_j} + 2^{a_k} > 2^{a_i}\)

Given that the lengths are powers of 2, the only way to satisfy the triangle inequality is if the three chosen lengths are the same. This is because the sum of any two distinct powers of 2 is never greater than the next higher power of 2. For example, \(2^1 + 2^2 = 2 + 4 = 6\), which is not greater than \(2^3 = 8\).

However, the program should also consider the case where three different sticks can form a triangle if they are all of the same length. The current logic does not handle this correctly. A correct approach would involve counting the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length and ensuring that no other combinations are considered.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        v = [0] * (n + 1)
        for _ in range(n):
            x = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            v[x] += 1
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if v[i] >= 3:
                ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
        results.append(str(ans))
    print('\n'.join(results))
```

This version correctly counts the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length, which is the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle with the given stick lengths.
