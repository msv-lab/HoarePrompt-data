Output State: **The `min_heap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from the first `d` elements of `row` and its corresponding index, and `min_heap` is now a valid min-heap with the tuple `(row[i], i)` added. The variable `i` remains `d`. The loop has removed all tuples from `min_heap` where the index is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. The value of `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The `min_heap` is updated by adding the tuple `(row[i], i)` to it.
- The `min_heap` remains a valid min-heap after the addition.
- The variable `i` remains unchanged at `d`.
- The loop condition that removes tuples from `min_heap` where the index is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)` is still valid.
- The value of `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.
