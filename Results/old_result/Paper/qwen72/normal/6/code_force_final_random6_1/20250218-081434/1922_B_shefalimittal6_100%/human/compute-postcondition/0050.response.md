Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 3`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `n` is `int(data[n + 2])`, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v` (which is 0), `i` is `n`, `ans` is the total number of pairs and triplets of indices where the values in `data` are the same, calculated based on the counts in `v`.**

Explanation:
- The code `v = [0] * (n + 1)` initializes `v` as a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- The value of `cnt` is now the sum of all elements in `v`, which is 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `idx`, `data`, `results`, `n`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
