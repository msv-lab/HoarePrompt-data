Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `l[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, and `r[a[k] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `k` from `n` to `2n-1`. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `l[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, `ul` is increased by 2, and if `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the loop breaks. `k` is now equal to `2 * k - ul`. The value of `k` is non-zero.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. If `re` is equal to `k`, `res` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `re` is not equal to `k`, `res` and `re` remain unchanged, and the program continues execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `res` remains unchanged but has a new element `a[1]` appended to it if `l[a[1] - 1] == 1`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged. `re` is increased by 1 if `l[a[1] - 1] == 1`, otherwise `re` remains unchanged. If `re` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `res` remains unchanged, and `re` remains unchanged. If `re` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
