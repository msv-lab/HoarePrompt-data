Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 2`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices` and `path` contains `v` if `v` was not 0. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.**
