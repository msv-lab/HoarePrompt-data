Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\) and \(n\) must be greater than 2, `left` is a list containing the integer 0, `ans` is a list of length \(n\), where each element is -1, and `i` is 2. If \(a[2] \neq a[1]\), `last` is a list containing the integers -1, 1, and 2. Otherwise, `last` is a list containing the integers -1, -1, and -1.***
