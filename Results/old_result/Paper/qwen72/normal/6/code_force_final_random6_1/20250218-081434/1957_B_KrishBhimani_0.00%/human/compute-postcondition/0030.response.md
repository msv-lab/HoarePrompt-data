Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `arr` must have at least one element, `ans` remains an empty list, `c` is increased by 1. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` contains the value `k0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains an empty list and `c` retains its new value.**
