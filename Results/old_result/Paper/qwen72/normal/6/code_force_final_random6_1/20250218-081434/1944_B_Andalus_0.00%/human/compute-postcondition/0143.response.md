The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. If `lft[3]` is equal to `lft[2]`, then `ldb` contains the element at index 3 of `lft`. Otherwise, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[3]` is not equal to `lft[4]`, then `sng` has been appended with the value of `lft[3]`. If neither of these conditions is met, `sng` remains unchanged.**
