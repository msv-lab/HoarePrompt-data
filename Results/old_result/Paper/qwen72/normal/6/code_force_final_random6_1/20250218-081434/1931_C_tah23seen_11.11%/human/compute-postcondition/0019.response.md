Output State: **If `arr` is a palindrome (meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards), then `i` is len(arr) // 2 and `j` is len(arr) // 2 - 1 if the length of `arr` is even, or `i` is (len(arr) // 2) + 1 and `j` is len(arr) // 2 - 1 if the length of `arr` is odd. Otherwise, `i` and `j` remain at the positions where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`.**

In natural language, this means that if the list `arr` is a palindrome, the loop will continue to increment `i` and decrement `j` until they meet in the middle (or just past the middle if the length is odd). If `arr` is not a palindrome, the loop will stop as soon as it finds two elements that do not match, and `i` and `j` will remain at those positions.
