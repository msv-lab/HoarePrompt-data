Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, then `sunks` is set to 1. Otherwise, `sunks` remains 0 and `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`.***
