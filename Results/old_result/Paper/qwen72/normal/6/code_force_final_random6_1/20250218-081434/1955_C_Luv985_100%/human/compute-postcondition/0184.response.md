Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` where `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, and `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - mi`. If `a[r]` == 0, then `r` is `n - 2` and `ans` is 2. If `a[l]` == 0, then `l` is 1 and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `r` remains `n - 1` and `ans` is 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is set to `k % 2`, `k` remains a positive integer, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, otherwise `ans` remains 0.**
