Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is the index where the first inequality was found if the loop was broken, otherwise `j` is `n-2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first integer in the list `num`, `symb2` is the last integer in the list `num`, `i` is the index where the first inequality was found if the loop was broken, otherwise `i` is `n-2`, `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in the list `num` up to the point where the first inequality was found or the end of the list, `ii` is the index of the last element checked in `onum` before the loop broke or completed, `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in the reversed list `onum` up to the point where the first inequality was found or the end of the list.**

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `t` remains an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The value of `r` remains 0.
- The value of `n` is an input integer greater than 1, which is the length of the list `num`.
- The value of `f` remains 1.
- The list `num` remains unchanged.
- The variable `j` is set to the index where the first inequality was found in the reversed list `onum`, or `n-2` if no inequality was found.
- The list `onum` remains a reversed copy of `num`.
- The variable `symb1` remains the first integer in the list `num`.
- The variable `symb2` remains the last integer in the list `num`.
- The variable `i` is set to the index where the first inequality was found in the original list `num`, or `n-2` if no inequality was found.
- The variable `cn` remains the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in the list `num` up to the point where the first inequality was found or the end of the list.
- The variable `ii` is the index of the last element checked in `onum` before the loop broke or completed.
- The variable `ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element in the reversed list `onum` up to the point where the first inequality was found or the end of the list.
