Postcondition: **`tc` is 2 or 3, `N` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 0, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default type int, and `cnt[a[j]]` is the count of how many times the element `a[j]` appears in the list `a` for each `j` from 0 to `N-1`. If `cnt[i]` is 1, then `t` is set to 1. Otherwise, `t` remains 0. The current value of `t` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 2, and if `cnt[i]` is 0, then `t` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 2.**
