Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input, `ans` is equal to the first element of `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, `i` is 0, `dif` is the difference between the second and the first element of `a`, `dif` is not 0, `res` remains equal to `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
