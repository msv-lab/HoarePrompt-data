Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0, and it is now `t - 1`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
- The length of `s` is less than 200 if `n` is even and the initial length of `s` was less than 200.
- The length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200 if `n` is even and the initial length of `s` was greater than or equal to 200.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s)
```

### Analysis:
1. **String `s` Construction**:
   - The string `s` is constructed by repeating the substring 'AAB' `n // 2` times.
   - For example, if `n` is 4, then `s` will be 'AABAAB'.
   - If `n` is 6, then `s` will be 'AABAABAAB'.

2. **Length of `s`**:
   - The length of `s` is determined by the number of repetitions of 'AAB'.
   - Each repetition of 'AAB' adds 3 characters to the string.
   - Therefore, the length of `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`.

3. **Conditions on Length**:
   - If `n` is even and the initial length of `s` was less than 200, then the length of `s` will be less than 200.
   - If `n` is even and the initial length of `s` was greater than or equal to 200, then the length of `s` will be greater than or equal to 200.

### Conclusion:
- The string `s` will be printed.
- The exact content of `s` is 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
- The length of `s` will be `3 * (n // 2)`, which will be less than 200 if the initial length was less than 200, and greater than or equal to 200 if the initial length was greater than or equal to 200.

### Final Output:
Output: **'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times (where the length of the string is `3 * (n // 2)`, and is less than 200 if `n` is even and the initial length was less than 200, and greater than or equal to 200 if `n` is even and the initial length was greater than or equal to 200)**
