Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1`), `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, `s` remains unchanged. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. The length of `s` is less than 200 if `n` is even and the initial length of `s` was less than 200. The length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200 if `n` is even and the initial length of `s` was greater than or equal to 200.**
