Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is already not beautiful. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

The array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]` is not beautiful because there is no index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ 4) such that `a[i-1] = a[i+1]`. However, the program will still output `1`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `-1` because the array is already not beautiful and no elements need to be removed.
