Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 5`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `v[x]` incremented by 1, `cnt` is 0, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the total number of pairs and triplets of indices where the values in `data` are the same, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx]`.**

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `n + 5`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
