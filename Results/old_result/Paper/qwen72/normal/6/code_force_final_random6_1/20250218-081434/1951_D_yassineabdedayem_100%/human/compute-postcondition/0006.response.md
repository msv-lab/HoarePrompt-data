Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `_` is a placeholder variable (its value is not relevant to the problem).
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from the standard input.
   - `n` and `k` are the first and second integers in the input line, respectively.
   - The current values of `n` and `k` are equal.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `1`.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not used in the `print` statement.
   - The precondition states that `n` and `k` are equal, but this information is not relevant to the output of the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Output: **1**
