The code snippet `results.append(result)` adds the value of `result` to the list `results`. The value of `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`. The list `results` was initially empty, so after this line of code, `results` contains one element, which is `result`.

Output State: **`input` is now a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read by `sys.stdin`, `index` is 5 + `2 * n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of the string at `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of the string at `data[3]`, `PS` is the integer value of the string at `data[4]`, `p` is a list of integers from the strings at `data[5:5 + n]`, `a` is a list of integers from the strings at `data[5 + n:5 + 2 * n]`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.**
