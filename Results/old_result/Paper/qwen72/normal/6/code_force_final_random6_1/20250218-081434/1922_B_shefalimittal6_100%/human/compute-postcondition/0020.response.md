Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 5, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where `v[x]` is now 2, `x` is the integer value of the string at `data[4]`**

Explanation:
- `idx` is incremented by 1, so it changes from 4 to 5.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
