You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #The program returns the total number of elements removed from `nums` that were reduced to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers and `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers. It returns the total number of elements removed from `nums` that were reduced to 0. If the list `nums` ends up containing exactly one positive integer and `k` is greater than or equal to this integer, the function returns the total count of removed elements plus 1. Otherwise, it returns just the total count of removed elements. After the function concludes, `nums` is a deque containing 0 or 1 positive integers, and `k` is the remaining value after subtracting the total cost of removing the minimum elements from `nums` in pairs.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to solve the problem for a single test case.
   - It converts the list of ship durabilities `nums` into a deque for efficient popping from both ends.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The program enters a while loop that continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and at least two ships remain (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - In each iteration, it pops the first ship (`a`) and the last ship (`b`) from the deque.
   - It calculates the minimum durability between the two ships (`x`).
   - If the remaining attacks (`k`) are sufficient to reduce both ships' durabilities by `x`, it does so and decrements `k` by `2 * x`.
   - If `a` still has positive durability after the attack, it is appended back to the left of the deque.
   - If `b` still has positive durability after the attack, it is appended back to the right of the deque.
   - If a ship's durability drops to zero, it is not appended back, and the count of sunk ships (`ans`) is incremented.

4. **Single Ship Case**:
   - If the loop exits and there is exactly one ship left (`len(nums) == 1`), and the remaining attacks (`k`) are sufficient to sink this ship, the program increments the count of sunk ships by one and returns `ans + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it simply returns `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the number of sunk ships.

### Analysis:
- **Efficiency**:
  - Using a deque allows efficient popping from both ends, which is crucial for the problem's requirements.
  - The while loop ensures that the program only processes ships that are still in the deque, which is correct.

- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly handles the alternating attacks on the first and last ships.
  - It correctly reduces the durabilities and counts the number of sunk ships.
  - The special case for a single remaining ship is also handled correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and should produce the correct output for the given inputs.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
