Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. `output1` is a list containing `[1, 2, 3]` if `x` is divisible by both `1` and `2` and `i` (which is 3), otherwise `output1` is a list containing `[1, 3]` if `x` is divisible by `i` (which is 3) but not by `2`, or `[1]` if `x` is not divisible by `i` (which is 3). `output2` is a list containing `[x, x // 2, x // 3]` if `x` is divisible by both `1` and `2` and `i` (which is 3), otherwise `output2` is a list containing `[x, x // 3]` if `x` is divisible by `i` (which is 3) but not by `2`, or `[x]` if `x` is not divisible by `i` (which is 3). `i` is 3.***
