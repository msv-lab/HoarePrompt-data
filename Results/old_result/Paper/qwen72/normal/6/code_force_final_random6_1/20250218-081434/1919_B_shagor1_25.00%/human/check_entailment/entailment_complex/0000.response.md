### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s` as specified in the problem description.

2. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.
   - The penalty is then calculated using the formula `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

3. **Optimal Splitting:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`.
   - The optimal way to minimize the penalty is to split the array such that the sum of each subarray is zero as much as possible. This is because the penalty of a subarray with a sum of zero is zero, and any non-zero sum subarray will contribute positively to the total penalty.
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` is derived from the observation that each '+' character contributes 1 to the sum and each '-' character contributes -1. If the number of '+' and '-' characters is not equal, the optimal split will leave the minimum number of non-zero sum subarrays, and the penalty will be the length of the string minus twice the number of '-' characters (since each '-' character reduces the sum by 1, and the penalty is the absolute sum times the length).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, it means all characters in `s` are '-', and the optimal penalty is `n` because each subarray will have a sum of -1, and the penalty for each subarray will be 1.
   - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the formula `n - 2 * neg` correctly calculates the minimum penalty by considering the balance between '+' and '-' characters.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct minimum penalty for each test case as required by the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty for each test case based on the given problem description and constraints.
