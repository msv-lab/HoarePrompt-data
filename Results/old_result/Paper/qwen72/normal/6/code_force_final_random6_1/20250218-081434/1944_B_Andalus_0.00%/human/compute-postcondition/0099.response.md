To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively and must have at least 3 elements.
   - `elem` is the third element in `rdb`.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, `sz` remains 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement after the if block.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - `elem` is defined as the third element in the list `rdb`.
   - Since `rdb` must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is guaranteed to be a valid element in the list.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be the value of `elem` printed twice, followed by a space.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be:
Output: **[elem] [elem] (where elem is the third element in the list rdb)**
