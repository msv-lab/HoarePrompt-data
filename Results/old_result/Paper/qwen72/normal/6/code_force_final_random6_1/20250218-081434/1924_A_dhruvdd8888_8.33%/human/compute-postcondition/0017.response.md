Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the second character of `s`, `win` is a set containing the first and second characters of `s`, `ans` is a list containing the first and second characters of `s`, and `ps` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `ans` is a list containing the first character of `s`.
- The code `ans.append(i)` adds the second character of `s` (which is `i`) to the list `ans`.
- Therefore, `ans` now contains both the first and second characters of `s`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
