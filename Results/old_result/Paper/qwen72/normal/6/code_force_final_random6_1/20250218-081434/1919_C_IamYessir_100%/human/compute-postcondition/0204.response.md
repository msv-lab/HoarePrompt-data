Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list with `lit[1]` appended to it, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element, `x` is set to infinity if `a` is an empty list; otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of list `a`, `y` is set to `lit[1]` if `b` was initially empty; otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b` before the new append.**

Explanation:
- The value of `lit[1]` is appended to the list `b`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `s`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged except for `b` and `y`.
- If `b` was initially empty, `y` is now set to `lit[1]`.
- If `b` was not empty, `y` remains the last element of `b` before the new append.
- The count `s` of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element is not affected by this single append operation.
