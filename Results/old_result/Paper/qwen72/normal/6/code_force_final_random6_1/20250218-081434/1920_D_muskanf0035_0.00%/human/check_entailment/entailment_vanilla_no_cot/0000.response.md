Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program is incorrect for the given problem specification. The issue lies in the way the second type of operation is handled in `func_1`. Specifically, the program does not correctly replicate the array `x` times as required by the operation `2 x`. Instead, it only duplicates the array once, which is a significant deviation from the problem's requirements.

Here is the problematic part of the code:

```python
else:
    array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
```

This code snippet only appends one copy of the current array to itself, regardless of the value of `x`. To correctly handle the second type of operation, the array should be extended `x` times, not just once.

A corrected version of the function `func_1` would look like this:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            current_array = array[:]
            for _ in range(value - 1):
                array.extend(current_array)
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result
```

In this corrected version, the array is duplicated `x` times by first making a copy of the current array and then extending the array `x-1` times with this copy. This ensures that the array is correctly replicated as specified in the problem description.

Additionally, the program should handle the large size of the array efficiently, especially for large values of `x` and large queries. The current approach of extending the array directly can lead to memory and performance issues. A more efficient approach would be to keep track of the cumulative length of the array and use modular arithmetic to determine the position of the queried elements without actually constructing the entire array.
