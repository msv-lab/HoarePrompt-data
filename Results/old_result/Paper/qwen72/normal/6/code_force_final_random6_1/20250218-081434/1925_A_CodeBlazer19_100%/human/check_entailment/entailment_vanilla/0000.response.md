Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`. The goal is to minimize the length of `s` while ensuring all required subsequences are present.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It then constructs a string `s` by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times.
   - The constructed string is printed for each test case.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Subsequence Requirement**: The program constructs the string `s` as `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n`. This means the string `s` is composed of the first `k` letters of the alphabet, repeated `n` times.
   - **Example Verification**:
     - For `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the string `s` is `ab`. This string contains both `a` and `b` as subsequences.
     - For `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the string `s` is `aa`. This string contains `aa` as a subsequence.
     - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the string `s` is `baab`. This string contains `aa`, `ab`, `ba`, and `bb` as subsequences.
     - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the string `s` is `abcbac`. This string contains all possible strings of length 2 using the first 3 letters (`aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, `cc`) as subsequences.
   - **Minimizing Length**: The program constructs a string of length `k * n`. This is the minimum length required to ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` letters are subsequences. This is because each letter must appear at least `n` times to form all possible subsequences of length `n`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly generates a string `s` that meets the requirements of the problem.
   - The length of the string `s` is minimized as required.

Correctness: **True**
