You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum number of segments `k` such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `x`.
   - Each segment `[l_i, r_i]` must satisfy `l_i <= r_i` and `r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1}` for consecutive segments.
   - The segments must cover the entire array from index 1 to n.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(arr, x)`**:
   - This function calls `find_max(arr, 31)`.
   - The choice of 31 as the starting bit is appropriate because `x` is less than `2^30`, so the highest bit to consider is the 30th bit (0-indexed).

3. **Function 2: `find_max(cur_arr, bit)`**:
   - **Base Case**: If `bit` is -1, it means we have considered all bits from 30 down to 0. In this case, we return the length of the current array `cur_arr`, which represents the number of segments.
   - **Segment Construction**:
     - We initialize `new_arr` to store the XOR results of segments.
     - We initialize `xor` to 0 to keep track of the current XOR value.
     - We iterate through `cur_arr` and update `xor` with the current element.
     - If the current `xor` value does not have the `bit`-th bit set (i.e., `xor >> bit & 1` is 0), we add `xor` to `new_arr` and reset `xor` to 0.
   - **Final Check**:
     - If `xor` still has the `bit`-th bit set after the loop, it means we cannot form a valid segment that satisfies the condition, so we set `thing1` to -1.
     - Otherwise, we recursively call `find_max` on `new_arr` with `bit - 1` and store the result in `thing1`.
   - **Bitwise OR Condition**:
     - If the `bit`-th bit of `x` is set (i.e., `x >> bit & 1` is 1), we need to consider both the possibility of including the current segment and the possibility of not including it. We return the maximum of:
       - The result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)`, which means we are not forming any segments at this bit level.
       - The length of `new_arr`, which represents the number of valid segments formed at this bit level.
     - If the `bit`-th bit of `x` is not set, we return `thing1`, which is the result of forming segments at this bit level.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The function `find_max` correctly handles the base case and the recursive case.
   - The logic for segment construction and final checks is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The bitwise operations are used correctly to determine the conditions for forming segments and checking the bitwise OR condition.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and should work as expected for the problem described.

**Correctness: True**
