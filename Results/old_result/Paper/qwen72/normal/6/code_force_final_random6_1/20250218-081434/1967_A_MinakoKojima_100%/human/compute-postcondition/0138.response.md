Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers.** 

The initial state indicates that `_` is 2. The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer, assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. The value of `_` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers.
