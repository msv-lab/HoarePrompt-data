Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input string.
   - `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input string.
   - If the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is not the string `"<"`.
   - `_` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `_`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('Yes')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'Yes'`.
   - The initial state provides conditions and variables, but the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It will always print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, or `_`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always output the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
