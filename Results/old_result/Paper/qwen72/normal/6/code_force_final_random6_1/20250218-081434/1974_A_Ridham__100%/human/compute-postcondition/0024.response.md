The only object in the loop head is the variable `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 0. Since the loop variable `_` is not used and `n` is decremented by 1 for each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 1 after the decrement.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 1, `result` is a list. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains the value of `screen_require_for_y`. If `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`, `result` contains the value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space` is divisible by 15, or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise. `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is an even integer or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is an odd integer, and `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.**
