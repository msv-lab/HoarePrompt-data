The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop iterates a fixed number of times based on the value provided by `int(input())`, and the variable `_` is a dummy variable that is incremented with each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `_` is 0
- `k` and `a` are integers provided by the user
- `x` is the number of iterations the loop has run
- `i` is `x - 1`
- `s` is the final value after `x` iterations of the loop, where the value of `s` depends on `k` and `x`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The loop counter `_` must be incremented by 1.
- The number of iterations `x` must be incremented by 1.
- `i` should be updated to `x - 1` (which is `x` after the increment).

However, since `_` is a dummy variable and the loop condition is based on the value provided by `int(input())`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `_`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 1, `k` and `a` are integers provided by the user, `x` is the number of iterations the loop has run + 1, `i` is `x`, `s` is the final value after `x + 1` iterations of the loop, where the value of `s` depends on `k` and `x + 1`**
