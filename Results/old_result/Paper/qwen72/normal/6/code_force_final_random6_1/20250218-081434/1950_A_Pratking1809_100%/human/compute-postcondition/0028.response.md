Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `q` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user input. It then checks the relationship between these three integers and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `q` test cases have been processed, and the appropriate output has been printed for each case. **
