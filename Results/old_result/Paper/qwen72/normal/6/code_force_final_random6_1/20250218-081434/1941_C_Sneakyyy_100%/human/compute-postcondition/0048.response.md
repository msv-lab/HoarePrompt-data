The value of `i` is incremented by 3. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string with length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and of length 3, if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6, otherwise if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is 7, `ans` is 1, if `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 0 and `i` is 5, `len(a)` must be greater than 5 if `i` is 6 or 7, or greater than 4 if `i` is 5.**
