The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the input integer `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`a` is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `lft` is the first n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the last n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is a list containing the first element of `lft` if the second element of `lft` is equal to the first element of `lft`. Otherwise, `ldb` is an empty list. `rdb` is an empty list. If `lft[2]` is equal to `lft[1]`, `ldb` is updated to contain `lft[2]`. If `lft[2]` is not equal to `lft[1]` and `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` is a list containing the value `lft[2]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list. `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
