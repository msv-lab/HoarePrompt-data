Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least one character, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `i` is 0, and `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus 1.**
