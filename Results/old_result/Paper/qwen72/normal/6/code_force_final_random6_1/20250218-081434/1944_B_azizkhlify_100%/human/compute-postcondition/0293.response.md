Output State: **`res` is a list with all elements that satisfy `l[a[j] - 1] == 1` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`, and `i` has iterated through all elements in `res`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the elements in the list `res`.
- For each iteration, the current element `i` is printed.
- The loop will execute as many times as there are elements in `res` that satisfy the condition `l[a[j] - 1] == 1` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
- After all iterations, `i` will have gone through every element in `res` that meets the condition, and all such elements will have been printed.

Thus, the final output state is that `res` contains all the elements that satisfy the condition, and the loop has completed by iterating through all of these elements.
