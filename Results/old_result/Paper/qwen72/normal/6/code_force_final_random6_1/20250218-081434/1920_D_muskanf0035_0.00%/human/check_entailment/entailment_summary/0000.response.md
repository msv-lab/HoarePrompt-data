Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for simulating the operations on the array and answering the queries.
   - It initializes an empty array `array` and an empty result list `result`.
   - For each operation in `operations`, it either appends a single value to `array` (if the operation type is 1) or extends `array` by duplicating its current elements `x` times (if the operation type is 2).
   - After processing all operations, it answers each query by appending the element at index `(k - 1) % len(array)` to `result`.
   - This approach works for small inputs, but it has a significant flaw: it does not handle the large sizes of `array` that can result from the second type of operation (2), especially when `x` is very large (up to \(10^9\)). The array can grow exponentially, leading to memory and performance issues.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases and processes each one by calling `func_1`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the operations, and the queries.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints the results.
   - This function is correct in terms of reading inputs and printing outputs, but it relies on `func_1` to handle the operations and queries correctly.

3. **Combined Analysis**:
   - The problem description specifies that the array can grow very large, up to \(10^{18}\) elements, which is impractical to store in memory.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not account for this and will fail for large inputs due to memory constraints.
   - A correct solution would need to avoid explicitly storing the entire array and instead use a more efficient method to determine the k-th element, such as keeping track of the lengths of segments and their contents.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not handle large inputs efficiently and will fail due to memory constraints.

Correctness: **False**
