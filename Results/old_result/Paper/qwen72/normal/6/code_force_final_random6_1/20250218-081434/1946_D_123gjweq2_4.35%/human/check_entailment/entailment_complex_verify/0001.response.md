### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments `k` such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `x`.
   - Each segment `[l_i, r_i]` must satisfy `l_i <= r_i` and `r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1}` for consecutive segments.
   - The segments must cover the entire array from index 1 to n.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(arr, x)`**:
   - This function calls `find_max(arr, 31)`.
   - The choice of 31 as the starting bit is appropriate because `x` is less than `2^30`, so the highest bit to consider is the 30th bit (0-indexed).

3. **Function 2: `find_max(cur_arr, bit)`**:
   - **Base Case**: If `bit` is -1, it means we have considered all bits from 30 down to 0. In this case, we return the length of the current array `cur_arr`, which represents the number of segments.
   - **Segment Construction**:
     - We initialize `new_arr` to store the XOR results of segments.
     - We initialize `xor` to 0 to keep track of the current XOR value.
     - We iterate through `cur_arr` and update `xor` with the current element.
     - If the current `xor` value does not have the `bit`-th bit set (i.e., `xor >> bit & 1` is 0), we add `xor` to `new_arr` and reset `xor` to 0.
   - **Final Check**:
     - If `xor` still has the `bit`-th bit set after the loop, it means we cannot form a valid segment that satisfies the condition, so we set `thing1` to -1.
     - Otherwise, we recursively call `find_max` on `new_arr` with `bit - 1` and store the result in `thing1`.
   - **Bitwise OR Condition**:
     - If the `bit`-th bit of `x` is set (i.e., `x >> bit & 1` is 1), we need to consider both the possibility of including the current segment and the possibility of not including it. We return the maximum of:
       - The result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)`, which means we are not forming any segments at this bit level.
       - The length of `new_arr`, which represents the number of valid segments formed at this bit level.
     - If the `bit`-th bit of `x` is not set, we return `thing1`, which is the result of forming segments at this bit level.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The function `find_max` correctly handles the base case and the recursive case.
   - The logic for segment construction and final checks is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The bitwise operations are used correctly to determine the conditions for forming segments and checking the bitwise OR condition.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Base Case**:
  - When `bit` is -1, the function returns the length of `cur_arr`. This is correct because it indicates the number of segments formed after considering all bits.

- **Segment Construction**:
  - The loop iterates through `cur_arr` and constructs segments where the `bit`-th bit of the XOR result is 0. This is correct because it ensures that the segments are valid according to the problem constraints.

- **Final Check**:
  - If `xor` still has the `bit`-th bit set after the loop, `thing1` is set to -1. This is correct because it indicates that no valid segment can be formed at this bit level.
  - Otherwise, `thing1` is set to the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`. This is correct because it recursively checks the next bit level with the valid segments formed.

- **Bitwise OR Condition**:
  - If the `bit`-th bit of `x` is set, the function returns the maximum of the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`. This is correct because it considers both the possibility of forming segments and not forming segments at this bit level.
  - If the `bit`-th bit of `x` is not set, the function returns `thing1`. This is correct because it only considers the valid segments formed at this bit level.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and should work as expected for the problem described.
