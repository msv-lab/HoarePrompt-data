To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **`n` is an input integer**: This is the number of elements in the list `arr`.
2. **`arr` is a list of integers read from input**: This is the list of integers.
3. **`flag` is False**: This indicates that no inequality was found in the list.
4. **`i` is the index where the first inequality was found**: Since `flag` is False, this means no inequality was found, so `i` is not relevant.
5. **`ans` is the minimum of the lengths of consecutive sequences of `val` in `arr` if any inequality was found, otherwise `ans` is the minimum of `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt`**:
   - Since `flag` is False, no inequality was found.
   - Therefore, `ans` is the minimum of `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt`.
6. **`val` is `arr[0]`**: This is the first element of the list `arr`.
7. **`cnt` is 0 if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `cnt` is the length of the last consecutive sequence of `val` in `arr`**:
   - Since `flag` is False, the loop completes without breaking.
   - Therefore, `cnt` is 0.

Given these conditions, the value of `ans` will be the minimum of `Decimal('Infinity')` and `0`. Since `0` is less than `Decimal('Infinity')`, `ans` will be `0`.

Output: **0**
