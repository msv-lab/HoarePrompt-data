Output State: **`t` is now equal to `2 * b // 5 + 1`, `t` is not divisible by 5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first input string, `b` is the integer value of the second input string.**

Explanation:
- `t` was initially set to `2 * b` and was not divisible by 5.
- The code `t = t // 5 + 1` updates `t` to be the integer division of `t` by 5, plus 1.
- Therefore, `t` is now equal to `2 * b // 5 + 1`.
- The new value of `t` is still not divisible by 5.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
