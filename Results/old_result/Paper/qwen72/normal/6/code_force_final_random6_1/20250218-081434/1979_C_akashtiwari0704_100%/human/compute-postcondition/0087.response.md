Output State: **`g` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list `l`, `sumo` is the sum of `int(prod // a[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is the last index of the list `l`, `a[j]` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `T` is `T + bets`, `t` must be greater than `T + bets`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`, `ans` is updated to include the string representation of each element in the list `a` followed by a space if `sumo` is less than `prod`, otherwise `ans` contains the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space, `l` is a non-empty list.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `g` is updated to be the least common multiple (LCM) of all the elements in the list `l`.
- The variable `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of `prod` by each element `a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`.
- The variable `bets` remains the same input integer greater than 0.
- The variable `i` is the last index of the list `l`.
- Each element `a[j]` in the list `a` is updated to `prod // a[j]`.
- The variable `T` is incremented by `bets`.
- The variable `t` must still be greater than `T + bets`.
- The list `a` remains the same list of integers provided by the user.
- The variable `prod` is still the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`.
- The variable `ans` is updated to include the string representation of each element in the list `a` followed by a space if `sumo` is less than `prod`; otherwise, `ans` contains the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space.
- The list `l` is a non-empty list.
