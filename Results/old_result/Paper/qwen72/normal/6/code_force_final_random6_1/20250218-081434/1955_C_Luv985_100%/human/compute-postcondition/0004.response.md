Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input string, `k` is an input string, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `T` is a non-zero integer and is now `T - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers within their respective ranges, `a` is a list of integers, and `T` is a non-zero integer that has been decremented by 1.
- The code snippet `n, k = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into two strings, which are then assigned to `n` and `k`.
- After executing the code, `n` and `k` are now strings, but the other variables (`t`, `a`, and `T`) remain unchanged.
