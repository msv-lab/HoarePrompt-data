Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of the original `maxi` and the new value of `c`.***
