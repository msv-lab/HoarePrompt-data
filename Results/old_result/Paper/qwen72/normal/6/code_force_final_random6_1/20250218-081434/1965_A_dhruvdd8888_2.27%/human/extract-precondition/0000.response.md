It seems there was an error in the function definition provided. Based on the problem description, the function should take the number of test cases and the piles of stones as inputs. Here is the corrected function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), representing the number of piles and the initial number of stones in each pile, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
