Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should accept three parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even) representing the number of columns in each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>' representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(str, input()))
    b = list(map(str, input()))
    if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input string, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input string. If the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is not the string `"<"`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` and `b` are lists of strings where each string is a character from the new input string. If the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is the string `"<"`, then `_` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `_`. If the element at index `n - 2` in `b` is not the string `"<"`, then `_` is also incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `_`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input string, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input string, `_` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `_`. If `b[n - 2]` is equal to the string "<", the postcondition remains the same. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
