To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `q` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
   - If `a < b < c`, then this condition holds.
   - If `a < b > c`, then the conditions `a < b` and `b > c` hold.
   - Otherwise, none of the conditions `a < b < c` or `a < b > c` hold.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('PEAK')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'PEAK'`.
   - The initial state provides conditions for the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement directly.
   - The `print` statement is independent of the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `i`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'PEAK'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `i`.

Output: **PEAK**
