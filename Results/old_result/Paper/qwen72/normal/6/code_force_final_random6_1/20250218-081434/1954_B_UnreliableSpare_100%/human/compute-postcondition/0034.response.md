Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt`.**

The value of `cnt` is reset to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `cnt` is 2 if `arr[1]` is equal to `val`, otherwise `cnt` is 0. Since the code snippet sets `cnt` to 0, this condition is no longer relevant. The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt`, which is 0.
