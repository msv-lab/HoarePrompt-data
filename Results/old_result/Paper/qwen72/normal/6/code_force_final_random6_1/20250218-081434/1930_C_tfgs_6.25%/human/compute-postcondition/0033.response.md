The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `adv`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `adv`. If `j` is less than `adv`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `adv` must be greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `j` is increased by 1, so `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `adv` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`j` is 1, `adv` must be greater than 1, `ans` has a new element equal to `a[i - 1] - 1`**
