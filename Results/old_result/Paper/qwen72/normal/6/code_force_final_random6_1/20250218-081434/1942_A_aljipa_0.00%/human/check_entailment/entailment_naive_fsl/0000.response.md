Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where \( k \) is between 1 and \( n \) (exclusive), and not equal to \( n \). For example, if \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 2 \), the program will output \(-1\), which is incorrect. According to the problem description, there should be a valid array for \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 2 \). One such valid array could be `[1, 2, 3, 1]`, which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2, 3]`. The program fails to generate such a valid array and instead outputs \(-1\).
