Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` starts at `n`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains greater than 0.
- The value of `i` remains `n`.
- The element in the list `r` at the index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1. The specific index depends on the value of `a[i]`, but it is certain that this index is updated by adding 1 to its current value.
