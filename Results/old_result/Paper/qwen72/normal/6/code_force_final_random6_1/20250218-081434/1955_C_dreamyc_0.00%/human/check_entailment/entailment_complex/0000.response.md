### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of ship durabilities `nums`.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function converts the list `nums` into a deque to efficiently handle popping from both ends.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will keep track of the number of ships sunk.
   - The main loop runs as long as `k` is greater than 0 and there are at least two ships left in the deque.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop pops the first and last elements of the deque (`a` and `b`).
   - It calculates the minimum durability between `a` and `b` (`x`).
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, it reduces both `a` and `b` by `x` and decreases `k` by `2 * x`.
   - If `a` is still positive after the reduction, it is appended back to the left of the deque.
   - If `b` is still positive after the reduction, it is appended back to the right of the deque.
   - If `a` or `b` is reduced to 0, the corresponding ship is sunk, and `ans` is incremented.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - After the main loop, if there is exactly one ship left and `k` is greater than or equal to the remaining durability of that ship, the ship is sunk, and `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - If the loop exits and there are no more ships to attack, or if `k` is not enough to sink the last remaining ship, the function returns `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the number of ships sunk.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output formats.
- The logic for simulating the Kraken's attacks is sound and follows the problem description.
- The edge case where only one ship remains and `k` is sufficient to sink it is correctly handled.
- The program efficiently uses a deque to manage the ships, ensuring that the operations are performed in O(1) time for each attack.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
