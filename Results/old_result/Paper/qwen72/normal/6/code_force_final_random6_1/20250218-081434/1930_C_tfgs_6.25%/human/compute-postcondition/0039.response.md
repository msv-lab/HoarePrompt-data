Output State: **`j` is `adv - 1`, `adv` must be greater than 0, `ans` has `adv` new elements: `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - adv`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is `counter[a[i - 1]] - adv`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `j` remains `adv - 1`.
- The value of `adv` is still greater than 0.
- The `ans` list still has `adv` new elements: `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - adv`.
- The value of `cnt` remains `cnt - adv`.
- The value of `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decremented by `adv`. Therefore, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is now `counter[a[i - 1]] - adv`.
