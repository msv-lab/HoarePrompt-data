The only variable in the loop head is `T`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is truthy (i.e., non-zero), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `T` is an input integer. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `T` must be non-zero.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^{15}, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `T` must be non-zero**
