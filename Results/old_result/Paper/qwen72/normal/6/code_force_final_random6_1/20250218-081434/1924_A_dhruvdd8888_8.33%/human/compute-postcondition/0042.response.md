Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `s` is an input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must have at least 1 element.
- `win` is an empty set.
- `ans` is a list containing all characters from `s` that were added to `win` when `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters.
- `ps` is the number of times `win` was cleared (i.e., the number of times `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters), and `ps` is less than `n`.
- If `i` is not in `win`, then `i` is the next element of `us` and is not in `win`. Otherwise, `i` is the next element of `us` and is in `win`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`ans`**: This list contains all characters from `s` that were added to `win` when `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters. The exact characters in `ans` depend on the input string `s` and the value of `k`.

2. **`i`**: This variable is the next element of `us` that is not in `win` if `win` does not already contain it. If `win` already contains it, `i` is the next element of `us` that is in `win`. The exact value of `i` depends on the current state of `win` and the set `us`.

3. **`n`**: This is an input integer that determines the length of the final string to be printed. The print statement will ensure that the final string has a length of `n`.

4. **`'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)`**: This part of the print statement ensures that the final string has a length of `n`. It appends `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters to the end of the string formed by `ans` and `i`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
- **`''.join(ans)`**: This converts the list `ans` into a string.
- **`i`**: This is the next character from `us` that is not in `win` or is in `win` depending on the current state.
- **`'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)`**: This appends the necessary number of 'a' characters to make the total length of the string equal to `n`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output a string that starts with the characters in `ans` joined together, followed by the character `i`, and then the necessary number of 'a' characters to make the total length of the string equal to `n`.

Since the exact values of `ans` and `i` depend on the input and the state of `win`, we can describe the output in a general form.

Output: **[characters from `ans` joined together] + [next character `i` from `us`] + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1) (where `ans` is a list of characters from `s` that were added to `win` when `win` contained exactly `k` unique characters, and `i` is the next character from `us` that is either not in `win` or is in `win`)**

This format ensures that the output string is of length `n` and follows the given conditions.
