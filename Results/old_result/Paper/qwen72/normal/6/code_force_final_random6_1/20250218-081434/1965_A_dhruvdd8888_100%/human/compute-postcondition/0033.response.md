Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers that includes the integer 0 and has been modified such that each element `nums[i]` is reduced by the sum of all previous elements in the list, `nums` must have at least 3 elements, `ls` is equal to the sum of all elements in the modified `nums` list, `i` is `len(nums) - 3`, `nw` is the same as the value of `cw` before the code execution. If `nums[i]` == 1, `cw` is the opposite of the value of `nw` (which is the same as the value of `cw` before the code execution). Otherwise, `cw` is `True`.**

In natural language: The code snippet assigns the value of `cw` to `nw`. Therefore, `nw` now holds the same value as `cw` did before the code execution. The value of `cw` remains unchanged unless `nums[i]` is 1, in which case `cw` becomes the opposite of `nw` (which is the same as the value of `cw` before the code execution). If `nums[i]` is not 1, `cw` is set to `True`. All other variables (`test_cases`, `N`, `nums`, `ls`, `i`) remain unchanged.
