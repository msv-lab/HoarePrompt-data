You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the input. It checks if all elements in `arr` are equal. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the first element in `arr` and prints this value. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a "beautiful" array, which means we can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element at index `i` with its neighbors if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer beautiful.
   - If it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful, we should output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.
   - It first checks if all elements in the array are the same by setting a `flag` to `True` and iterating through the array. If it finds any two consecutive elements that are different, it sets the `flag` to `False`.
   - If the `flag` is `True`, it means all elements are the same, and the array will always remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed. Hence, it prints `-1`.
   - If the `flag` is `False`, it means there are at least two different elements in the array. The program then tries to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   - It initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to represent an initially large value.
   - It iterates through the array, counting the number of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element `val`.
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive elements found so far.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum count of consecutive elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The program correctly identifies if all elements are the same and outputs `-1` in that case.
   - However, the logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program only considers the count of consecutive elements equal to the first element `val` and does not consider other possible sequences or the overall structure of the array.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is already non-beautiful but can be made beautiful by removing elements. It should find the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure the array cannot be made beautiful by the given operation.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To make the array non-beautiful, we need to ensure that there is no way to apply the operation `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}` to any index `i` such that `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.
   - One way to achieve this is to remove elements such that no three consecutive elements form a pattern where the middle element can be replaced by its neighbors.
   - The program should consider the entire array and not just the first element.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where the array is already non-beautiful but can be made beautiful by removing elements. It only considers the count of consecutive elements equal to the first element, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.
