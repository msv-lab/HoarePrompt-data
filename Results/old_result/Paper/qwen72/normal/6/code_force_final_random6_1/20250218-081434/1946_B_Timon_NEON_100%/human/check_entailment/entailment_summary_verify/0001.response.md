### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1:** This function correctly computes the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) of a given number. It is essential for handling large numbers and ensuring the result fits within the required constraints.
   - **func_2:** This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices. However, it has several issues:
     - It does not handle the case where the array is entirely negative correctly.
     - It does not update `max_segment` and `new_segment` in all scenarios, leading to incorrect results.
     - It appends the last segment incorrectly, which can lead to incorrect results.
     - It returns a segment with a negative sum if no positive segment is found, which is not the expected behavior.
   - **func_3:** This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operations. It initializes `answer` to 0 and does nothing else, returning `None` by default. This function is supposed to compute the final answer but is not implemented.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves using Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is positive, we can add it `k` times to the array.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is zero or negative, the best strategy is to add zero `k` times, which does not change the sum of the array.
   - The final sum should be computed as `max_sum * (k + 1) + initial_sum` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Kadane's Algorithm:**
   - Kadane's algorithm is a dynamic programming approach that efficiently finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in \(O(n)\) time.
   - The algorithm maintains a running sum and updates the maximum sum whenever a new maximum is found.

5. **Implementation:**
   - The provided `func_2` is not correctly implementing Kadane's algorithm.
   - The provided `func_3` is incomplete and does not compute the final answer.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the provided functions, particularly the incorrect implementation of Kadane's algorithm in `func_2` and the incomplete `func_3`, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
