Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase exactly k tickets under the given constraints. Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually, which is in line with the problem description.

2. **Priority Queue (Min-Heap)**: The program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always select the day with the lowest current price for purchasing tickets. This ensures that the tickets are bought at the minimum possible cost.

3. **Price Increase**: The program correctly handles the price increase for subsequent days after purchasing tickets. The `price_increase` variable keeps track of the total number of tickets bought so far, and this value is added to the price of each ticket purchased on subsequent days.

4. **Ticket Purchase Logic**: The program buys the minimum of `m` tickets or the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`) on each day. This ensures that the program does not exceed the daily ticket purchase limit and buys exactly `k` tickets.

5. **Total Cost Calculation**: The total cost is calculated by multiplying the current price (including the price increase) by the number of tickets bought on that day and adding it to the `total_cost`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `m`, the program will buy all tickets on the first available day with the lowest price.
   - If `k` is large and the daily limit `m` is small, the program will spread the purchases over multiple days, always choosing the day with the lowest current price.

The program handles all potential cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, and it produces the correct output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
