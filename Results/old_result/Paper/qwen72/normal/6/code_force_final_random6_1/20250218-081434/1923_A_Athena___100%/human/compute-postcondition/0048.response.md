Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list and its first element is no longer 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1` (where `a` is the list after all leading zeros and trailing zeros have been removed), `res` is 0, and `a[-1]` is no longer 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as the list `a` is non-empty and its last element is 0.
- After all iterations of the loop, the list `a` will have all trailing zeros removed.
- The variable `i` will be updated to `len(a) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the modified list `a`.
- The variables `t`, `_`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states.
- The first element of `a` is still not 0, and the last element of `a` is also no longer 0, ensuring that the list `a` is in its final form with no leading or trailing zeros.
