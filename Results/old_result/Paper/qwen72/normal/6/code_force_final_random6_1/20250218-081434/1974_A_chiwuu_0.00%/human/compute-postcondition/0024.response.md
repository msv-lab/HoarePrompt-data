The provided code snippet assigns the values of `a` and `b` from the input. Since the initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are the integer values of the first and second input strings, respectively, the code does not change the fact that `a` and `b` are integers. However, the values of `a` and `b` are now updated to the new input values.

The other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `t1`, and `t2`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is the integer value of the first input string, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`.**
