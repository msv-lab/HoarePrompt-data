Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is `l[x]`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `c` is 0, `x` is 0, and if `a` > `b`, then `a` is set to `b`. The current value of `a` is `l[x]` or has been updated to `b` if `b` was less than `l[x]`. Additionally, the current value of `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`.**
