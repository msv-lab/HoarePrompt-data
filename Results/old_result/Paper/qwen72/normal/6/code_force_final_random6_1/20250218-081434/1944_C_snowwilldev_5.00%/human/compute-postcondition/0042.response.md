Output State: **`tc` is 1 or 2, `N` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `t` is the number of times `cnt[i]` was 1 for `i` from 0 to `N-1`, and `cnt` is a defaultdict with default type int where `cnt[a[0]]` is 1, `cnt[a[1]]` is 1 or 2, and `cnt[a[2]]` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt[a[2]]` by 1.
- Since `i` is 2, `a[2]` is the third element in the list `a`.
- The initial value of `cnt[a[2]]` is 1 (because `cnt` is a defaultdict with default type int, and `cnt[a[2]]` would default to 0 if it was not already set, and then it would be incremented by 1 in the code).
- After the code execution, `cnt[a[2]]` becomes 2.
- The values of `tc`, `N`, `a`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged.
- The values of `cnt[a[0]]` and `cnt[a[1]]` also remain unchanged, with `cnt[a[0]]` being 1 and `cnt[a[1]]` being 1 or 2.
