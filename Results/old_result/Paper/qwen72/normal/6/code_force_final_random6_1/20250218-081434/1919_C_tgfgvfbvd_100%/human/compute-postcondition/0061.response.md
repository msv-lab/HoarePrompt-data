Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 1, `c` is 0 or 1, `a` is `l[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is updated to the value of `l[1]` (the second element of the list `l`).
- The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `x`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial state.
