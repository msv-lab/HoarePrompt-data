Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing 0 or 1 positive integers where 1 <= `nums[i]` <= 10^9, `ans` is the total number of elements removed from `nums` that were reduced to 0, `k` is the remaining value after subtracting the total cost of removing the minimum elements from `nums` in pairs, and the loop condition `while k and len(nums) >= 2` is no longer satisfied. Additionally, either `k` is 0, or `len(nums)` is not 1, or `k` is less than `nums[0]`.**
