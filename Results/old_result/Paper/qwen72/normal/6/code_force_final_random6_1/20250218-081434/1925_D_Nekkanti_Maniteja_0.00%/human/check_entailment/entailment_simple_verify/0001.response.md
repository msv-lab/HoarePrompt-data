### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of pairs of children chosen for `k` excursions.
   - The initial friendship values are given for `m` pairs of friends.
   - The teacher chooses pairs randomly, and if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

2. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The total number of possible pairs of children is \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair of friends in one excursion is \( \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \).
   - For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends plus the expected number of new pairs of friends chosen.

3. **Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends is \( a \).

4. **Expected Increase in Friendship Values:**
   - For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is \( \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times (i + 1) \) where `i` is the current excursion index.
   - This is because the friendship value of a chosen pair increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions, and the expected number of new pairs of friends chosen in the `i`-th excursion is \( \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \).

5. **Sum of Friendship Values Over `k` Excursions:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Expected Sum} = a + \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left( \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times i \right)
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{Expected Sum} = a + \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
     \]
   - Which further simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{Expected Sum} = a + \frac{m \times k \times (k+1)}{n(n-1)}
     \]

6. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - We need to compute the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - The modular inverse of \( n(n-1) \) is used to compute the division in modular arithmetic.

7. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly initializes the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It correctly calculates the modular inverse of \( n(n-1) \) using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`.
   - It correctly sums the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.
   - However, the program incorrectly calculates the expected increase in friendship values for each excursion. It uses `c * i * c * m` which is incorrect. It should be `c * m * (i + 1)` to correctly account for the expected increase in each excursion.

8. **Correct Formula:**
   - The correct formula for the expected increase in each excursion should be:
     \[
     s = s + c \times m \times (i + 1) + c \times a
     \]
   - This formula correctly accounts for the expected increase in friendship values for each excursion.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment correctly identified the issue in the program. The program incorrectly calculates the expected increase in friendship values for each excursion. The correct formula should be \( s = s + c \times m \times (i + 1) + c \times a \) instead of \( s = s + c \times i \times c \times m + c \times a \).

Final: **False**
