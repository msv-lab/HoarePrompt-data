### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments `k` such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `x`.
   - Each segment `[l_i, r_i]` must satisfy `l_i <= r_i` and `r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1}` for consecutive segments.
   - The segments must cover the entire array from index 1 to n.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(arr, x)`**:
   - This function calls `find_max(arr, 31)`.
   - The choice of 31 as the starting bit is appropriate because `x` is less than `2^30`, so the highest bit to consider is the 30th bit (0-indexed).

3. **Function 2: `find_max(cur_arr, bit)`**:
   - **Base Case**: If `bit` is -1, it means we have considered all bits from 30 down to 0. In this case, we return the length of the current array `cur_arr`, which represents the number of segments.
   - **Segment Construction**:
     - We initialize `new_arr` to store the XOR results of segments.
     - We initialize `xor` to 0 to keep track of the current XOR value.
     - We iterate through `cur_arr` and update `xor` with the current element.
     - If the current `xor` value does not have the `bit`-th bit set (i.e., `xor >> bit & 1` is 0), we add `xor` to `new_arr` and reset `xor` to 0.
   - **Final Check**:
     - If `xor` still has the `bit`-th bit set after the loop, it means we cannot form a valid segment that satisfies the condition, so we set `thing1` to -1.
     - Otherwise, we recursively call `find_max` on `new_arr` with `bit - 1` and store the result in `thing1`.
   - **Bitwise OR Condition**:
     - If the `bit`-th bit of `x` is set (i.e., `x >> bit & 1` is 1), we need to consider both the possibility of including the current segment and the possibility of not including it. We return the maximum of:
       - The result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)`, which means we are not forming any segments at this bit level.
       - The length of `new_arr`, which represents the number of valid segments formed at this bit level.
     - If the `bit`-th bit of `x` is not set, we return `thing1`, which is the result of forming segments at this bit level.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The function `find_max` correctly handles the base case and the recursive case.
   - The logic for segment construction and final checks is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The bitwise operations are used correctly to determine the conditions for forming segments and checking the bitwise OR condition.
   - However, there is a potential issue in the final check. If `xor` still has the `bit`-th bit set after the loop, the function sets `thing1` to -1. This is correct, but the function should also handle the case where the entire array cannot be segmented in a way that satisfies the condition. This is not explicitly handled in the function.

5. **Edge Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the case where the entire array `cur_arr` cannot be segmented such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results is less than or equal to `x`. The function should return -1 in this case.
   - The function does not explicitly handle this edge case, but it implicitly does so by setting `thing1` to -1 and returning it when the `bit`-th bit of `x` is not set.

6. **Function Summary Validation**:
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `find_max`.
   - The summary correctly states that the function returns the length of `cur_arr` if `bit` is -1.
   - The summary correctly describes the segment construction and the final checks.
   - The summary correctly states the conditions under which the function returns the maximum of two recursive calls or `thing1`.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and should work as expected for the problem described. The function `find_max` correctly handles the base case, recursive case, and edge cases as per the problem requirements.

**Final: True**
