Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the logic for updating the sum of friendship values is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Probability**:
   - The program calculates `c` as the multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is incorrect because the number of possible pairs of children is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, not `n * (n - 1) // 1`.

2. **Incorrect Update of Friendship Values**:
   - The program updates the sum `s` in a loop with the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. This formula is incorrect. The expected value of the sum of friendship values should be calculated based on the probability of choosing a friend pair and the initial friendship values.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values should be calculated as follows:
     - For each excursion, the probability of choosing a friend pair is `m / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
     - The expected increase in the sum of friendship values for each excursion is the sum of the initial friendship values plus the number of excursions times the number of friend pairs.
     - The correct formula for the expected value should be:
       \[
       \text{expected\_value} = \left( \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \times \left( \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (a + i \times m) \right)
       \]
       where \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n \times (n-1)}{2}\).

4. **Modulo Arithmetic**:
   - The program should use modulo arithmetic correctly to handle large numbers and ensure the result is within the required range.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        if total_pairs == 0:
            print(0)
            continue
        c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a = (a + f) % M
        expected_value = 0
        for i in range(k):
            expected_value = (expected_value + (a + i * m) * c) % M
        print(expected_value)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
