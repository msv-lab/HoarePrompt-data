Postcondition: ***`lst[x]` is a list with one less element than before, `y` is the last element that was removed from `lst[x]`, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged, `s` is `not s`. If `lst[y]` is a non-empty list, `x` is now equal to `y`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `x` and the program flow remains unchanged.***
