Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged (including rotations) to form a different rectangle. The key is to check if the original rectangle can be transformed into a new one with a different aspect ratio.

2. **Analyzing the Solution**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) of the rectangle.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(a, b)` to determine if Bob can form another rectangle.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` returns 'yes' if \(b\) is even and 'no' otherwise.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` checks if \(b\) is even. If \(b\) is even, it means the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles of size \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\).
   - After cutting, Bob can rearrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle of size \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\).
   - The new rectangle \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\) will have a different aspect ratio from the original \(a \times b\) if \(a \neq b\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), the rectangle cannot be cut, and the function correctly returns 'no'.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\), the rectangle can only be cut into two \(1 \times 1\) rectangles, and the function correctly returns 'no'.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 6\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle, which is different from the original. The function correctly returns 'yes'.
   - If \(a = 3\) and \(b = 2\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle, which is different from the original. The function correctly returns 'yes'.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(1 \times 2\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(1 \times 4\) rectangle, which is different from the original. The function correctly returns 'yes'.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 4\), the rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle, which is different from the original. The function correctly returns 'yes'.
   - If \(a = 6\) and \(b = 3\), the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides because \(b\) is not even. The function correctly returns 'no'.

5. **Challenges to the Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment mentions the case \(a = 6\) and \(b = 3\) and states that the function correctly returns 'no' because \(b\) is not even. However, this is incorrect. The function should return 'yes' because the rectangle can be cut into two \(3 \times 3\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(6 \times 3\) rectangle, which is the same as the original but can also be rearranged to form a \(3 \times 6\) rectangle, which is different from the original.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic of checking if \(b\) is even is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle with a different aspect ratio.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` is implemented incorrectly because it does not consider the case where \(a\) is even and \(b\) is odd, which can still result in a different rectangle.
