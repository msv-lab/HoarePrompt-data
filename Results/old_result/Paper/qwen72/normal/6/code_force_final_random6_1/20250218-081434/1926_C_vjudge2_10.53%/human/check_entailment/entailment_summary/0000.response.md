### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers, each representing the largest number `n` for each test case. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Pre-computation:**
   - The function initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, to store the sum of digits for each number and the cumulative sum of these values, respectively.
   - It correctly pre-computes the sum of digits for numbers from 1 to 9 and stores them in `values`. It also computes the cumulative sum for these numbers and stores them in `sum_values`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - For numbers greater than 9, the function uses a dynamic programming approach to compute the sum of digits. It converts the number to a string to extract the last digit and the remaining part of the number.
   - The sum of digits for a number `i` is computed as the sum of the last digit and the sum of digits of the remaining part of the number. This is stored in `values[i]`.
   - The cumulative sum for each number `i` is then computed and stored in `sum_values[i]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the cumulative sum of the digits for each test case number `n` from the `sum_values` list. This is the correct output format as specified in the problem description.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The function pre-computes the sum of digits and cumulative sums up to the maximum number in the test cases. This ensures that the function can handle multiple test cases efficiently without re-computing the same values repeatedly.
   - The time complexity of the pre-computation step is O(n), where n is the maximum number in the test cases. This is efficient given the constraints (n â‰¤ 2 * 10^5).

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is a single-digit number correctly by pre-computing the values for numbers from 1 to 9.

### Correctness:
The program is correct as it follows the problem description and handles the input, computation, and output correctly. The dynamic programming approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the constraints within the given time limit.

Correctness: **True**
