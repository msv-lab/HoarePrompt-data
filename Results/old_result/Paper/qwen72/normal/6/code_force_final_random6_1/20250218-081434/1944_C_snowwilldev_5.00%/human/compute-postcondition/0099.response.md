Output State: **`tc` is `int(input()) - 1`, `N` is the last input integer greater than 0, `a` is the last list of integers provided by the user, `i` is the index at which the loop breaks or `N-1` if it completes all iterations, `t` is the number of times an element with a count of 1 has been encountered before the loop breaks or completes all iterations, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default type int, and `cnt[a[j]]` is the count of how many times the element `a[j]` appears in the list `a` for each `j` from 0 to `N-1`.**

Explanation:
- `tc` will be `int(input()) - 1` because the loop runs `int(input())` times, and `tc` is incremented from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.
- `N` will be the last input integer for the final test case.
- `a` will be the last list of integers provided by the user for the final test case.
- `i` will be the index at which the loop breaks or `N-1` if the loop completes all iterations.
- `t` will be the number of times an element with a count of 1 has been encountered before the loop breaks or completes all iterations.
- `cnt` will be a defaultdict with default type int, and `cnt[a[j]]` will be the count of how many times the element `a[j]` appears in the list `a` for each `j` from 0 to `N-1`.
