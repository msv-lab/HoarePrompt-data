### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Each introvert needs a separate tent.
   - Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - Universals can be in any tent configuration (alone, with one other, or with two others).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(extroverts, universals)`**:
     - This function is responsible for calculating the minimum number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
     - If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, it checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents.
     - If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots, and the function returns `None`.
     - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`, which is the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the extroverts and universals.

   - **`func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)`**:
     - This function calculates the total number of tents required by adding the number of tents needed for introverts (which is simply `introverts` since each introvert needs a separate tent) to the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
     - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents for extroverts and universals.
     - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns `-1`.
     - Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the value returned by `func_1`.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the case where `extroverts % 3 != 0` and there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots.
   - The program correctly calculates the number of tents for each type of participant.
   - The program respects the constraints that `0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9` and `1 <= t <= 10^4`.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - **Test Case 1**: `1 2 3`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 2 (2 extroverts + 1 universal in 1 tent, 2 universals in 1 tent)
     - Total: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3 tents
   - **Test Case 2**: `1 4 1`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 4 (4 extroverts + 1 universal, but 1 universal is not enough to fill the remaining spot)
     - Total: -1 (impossible)
   - **Test Case 3**: `1 4 2`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 4 (4 extroverts + 2 universals, 2 universals in 1 tent)
     - Total: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3 tents
   - **Test Case 4**: `1 1 1`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 1 (1 extrovert + 1 universal, but 1 universal is not enough to fill the remaining spot)
     - Total: -1 (impossible)
   - **Test Case 5**: `1 3 2`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 3 (3 extroverts in 1 tent, 2 universals in 1 tent)
     - Total: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3 tents
   - **Test Case 6**: `19 7 18`
     - Introverts: 19 (19 tents)
     - Extroverts: 7 (7 extroverts + 2 universals in 3 tents, 16 universals in 5 tents)
     - Total: 19 (introverts) + 9 (extroverts and universals) = 28 tents
   - **Test Case 7**: `0 0 0`
     - Introverts: 0 (0 tents)
     - Extroverts: 0 (0 tents)
     - Universals: 0 (0 tents)
     - Total: 0 tents
   - **Test Case 8**: `7 0 0`
     - Introverts: 7 (7 tents)
     - Extroverts: 0 (0 tents)
     - Universals: 0 (0 tents)
     - Total: 7 tents
   - **Test Case 9**: `0 24 0`
     - Introverts: 0 (0 tents)
     - Extroverts: 24 (24 extroverts in 8 tents)
     - Universals: 0 (0 tents)
     - Total: 8 tents
   - **Test Case 10**: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
     - Introverts: 1000000000 (1000000000 tents)
     - Extroverts: 1000000000 (1000000000 extroverts + 1000000000 universals, 1000000000 universals in 333333333 tents)
     - Total: 1000000000 (introverts) + 666666667 (extroverts and universals) = 1666666667 tents

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem constraints and edge cases. It ensures that each introvert gets a separate tent, and it checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots for extroverts. If it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns the correct minimum number of tents.

Correctness: **True**
