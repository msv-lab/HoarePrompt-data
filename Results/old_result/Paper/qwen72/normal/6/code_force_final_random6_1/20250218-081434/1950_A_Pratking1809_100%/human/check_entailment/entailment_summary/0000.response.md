Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases, `q`, and then for each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. The program then checks the conditions for a "stair" (`a < b < c`) and a "peak" (`a < b > c`). If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE". The logic for determining whether the digits form a stair or a peak is accurate and matches the problem description. The program also handles the input and output as specified.

Correctness: **True**
