The value of `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1. The value of `c` is the third element of `s`, which is an integer. Depending on the value of `c`, `cnt` will be updated accordingly.

- If `c` is 0, `cnt` was initially [2, 0], and after the increment, `cnt` becomes [3, 0].
- If `c` is not 0, `cnt` was initially [0, 2], and after the increment, `cnt` becomes [0, 3].

The values of `n`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string with at least three elements, `c` is the third element of `s`. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [3, 0], and `ans` is `zeroes - 2`. Otherwise, `cnt` is [0, 3], and `ans` is `2 * (zeroes - 1) - 2`.**
