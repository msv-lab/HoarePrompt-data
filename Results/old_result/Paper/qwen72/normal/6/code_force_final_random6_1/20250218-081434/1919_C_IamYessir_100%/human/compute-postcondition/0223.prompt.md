Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, and `s` is 1 if the second element of `a` is greater than the first element of `a`. Otherwise, `s` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, and `s` is 2 if the third element of `a` is greater than the second element of `a`. Otherwise, `s` is 1 if the second element of `a` is greater than the first element of `a`, and `s` remains 0 otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, and `s` is 3 if the fourth element of `a` is greater than the third element of `a`; `s` is 2 if the third element of `a` is greater than the second element of `a` and the fourth element is not greater than the third element; `s` is 1 if the second element of `a` is greater than the first element of `a` and the third element is not greater than the second element; otherwise, `s` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
