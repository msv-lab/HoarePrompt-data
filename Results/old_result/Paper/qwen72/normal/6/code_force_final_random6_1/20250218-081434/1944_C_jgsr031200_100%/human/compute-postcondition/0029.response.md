Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where `0 <= arr[i] < len(arr)` for all `i`, and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5). `freq` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `freq[j]` represents the number of times the integer `j` appears in `arr`. `cou` is 0 or 1, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. `freq[2]` is greater than 0 for the loop to continue.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables `arr`, `freq`, `cou`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `freq[2]` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue is still valid.
