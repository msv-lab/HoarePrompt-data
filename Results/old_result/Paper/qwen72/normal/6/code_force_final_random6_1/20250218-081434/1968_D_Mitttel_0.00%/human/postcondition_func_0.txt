The function `func_1` takes in parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`. It calculates the scores for two players, Bodya and Sasha, using the `calculate_score` function with `PB` and `PS` as inputs, respectively. The function then compares these scores and returns 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, or 'Draw' if both scores are equal. The function does not modify any of its input parameters.
