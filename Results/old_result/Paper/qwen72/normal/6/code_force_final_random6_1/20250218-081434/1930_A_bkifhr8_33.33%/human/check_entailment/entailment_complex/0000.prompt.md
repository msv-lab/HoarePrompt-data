Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        
        n = int(input())
        
        l = input()
        
        lst = l.split(' ')
        
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `i` is `t` (which is 0), `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the sum of the minimum values of pairs of integers from `lst` for each of the `t` iterations, and `lst` is either an empty list or a list with 2 elements for each iteration.
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `i` has iterated through all elements of `ans_f`, `ans_f` contains `n` elements, and `lst` is either an empty list or a list with 2 elements for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the user, where `1 <= t <= 5000`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads an integer `n` (where `1 <= n <= 50`) and a list of `2n` integers from the user. It then processes these integers by repeatedly selecting the minimum of the first two elements, summing these minimum values, and removing the selected elements until the list is either empty or contains only two elements. The function appends the sum of these minimum values to a list `ans_f` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function prints each element in `ans_f`. The final state of the program is that `t` is 0, `ans_f` contains `t` elements, and the list `lst` is either empty or contains 2 elements for each iteration.
