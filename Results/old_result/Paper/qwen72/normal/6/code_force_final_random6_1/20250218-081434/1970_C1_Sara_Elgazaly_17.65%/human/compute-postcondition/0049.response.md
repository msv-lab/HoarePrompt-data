Output State: **`lst[x]` is now an empty list, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged from their initial values, `s` is the opposite of its initial value, `y` is the last element that was popped from `lst[x]` before it became empty, `x` is now equal to `y`.** 

In this output state, `x` has been updated to hold the value of `y`, which is the last element that was popped from `lst[x]` before it became empty. The other variables (`a`, `b`, and `_`) remain unchanged, and `s` is still the opposite of its initial value.
