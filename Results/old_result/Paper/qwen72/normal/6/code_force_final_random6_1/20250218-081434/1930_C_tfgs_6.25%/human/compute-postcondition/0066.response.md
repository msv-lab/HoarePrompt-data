Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**: This variable `t` is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for the purpose of determining the output.

2. **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5**: This variable `n` is used to determine the total length of the `ans` list after adding `cnt` elements.

3. **`a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order**: This means `a` contains distinct integers in decreasing order. For example, `a` could be `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.

4. **`counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a` but all values in `counter` are now 0**: This means `counter` is a dictionary-like object where the keys are the unique integers from `a` and all values are 0. For example, if `a` is `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, then `counter` would be `{5: 0, 4: 0, 3: 0, 2: 0, 1: 0}`.

5. **`cnt` is 0**: This variable `cnt` is used to determine how many additional elements are added to the `ans` list. Since `cnt` is 0, no additional elements will be added.

6. **`ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` and additional elements such that the total length of `ans` is `n + cnt`**: Since `cnt` is 0, the total length of `ans` will be `n`. The `ans` list will contain all elements from `a` followed by additional elements if necessary to reach the length `n`. However, since `cnt` is 0, the `ans` list will simply be the same as the `a` list.

Given the initial state, the `ans` list will be the same as the `a` list, which is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order.

The code snippet:
```python
print(*ans)
```
This will print all elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces.

Since `ans` is the same as `a`, the output will be the elements of `a` printed in descending order.

Output: **[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[len(a)-1]] (where a is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order)**

For example, if `a` is `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, the output will be:
Output: **5 4 3 2 1**
