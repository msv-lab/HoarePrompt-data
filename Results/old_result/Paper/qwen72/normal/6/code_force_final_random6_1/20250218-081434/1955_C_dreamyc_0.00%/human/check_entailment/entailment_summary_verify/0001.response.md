### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to solve the problem for a single test case.
   - It converts the list of ship durabilities `nums` into a deque for efficient popping from both ends.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The program enters a while loop that continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and at least two ships remain (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - In each iteration, it pops the first ship (`a`) and the last ship (`b`) from the deque.
   - It calculates the minimum durability between the two ships (`x`).
   - If the remaining attacks (`k`) are sufficient to reduce both ships' durabilities by `x`, it does so and decrements `k` by `2 * x`.
   - If `a` still has positive durability after the attack, it is appended back to the left of the deque.
   - If `b` still has positive durability after the attack, it is appended back to the right of the deque.
   - If a ship's durability drops to zero, it is not appended back, and the count of sunk ships (`ans`) is incremented.

4. **Single Ship Case**:
   - If the loop exits and there is exactly one ship left (`len(nums) == 1`), and the remaining attacks (`k`) are sufficient to sink this ship, the program increments the count of sunk ships by one and returns `ans + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it simply returns `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the number of sunk ships.

### Analysis:
- **Efficiency**:
  - Using a deque allows efficient popping from both ends, which is crucial for the problem's requirements.
  - The while loop ensures that the program only processes ships that are still in the deque, which is correct.

- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly handles the alternating attacks on the first and last ships.
  - It correctly reduces the durabilities and counts the number of sunk ships.
  - The special case for a single remaining ship is also handled correctly.

### Function Summary Verification:
- The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`.
  - It correctly states that the function returns the total number of elements removed from `nums` that were reduced to 0.
  - It correctly handles the case where the list `nums` ends up containing exactly one positive integer and `k` is greater than or equal to this integer.
  - After the function concludes, `nums` is a deque containing 0 or 1 positive integers, and `k` is the remaining value after subtracting the total cost of removing the minimum elements from `nums` in pairs.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and should produce the correct output for the given inputs. The function summary and the original assessment are both accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
