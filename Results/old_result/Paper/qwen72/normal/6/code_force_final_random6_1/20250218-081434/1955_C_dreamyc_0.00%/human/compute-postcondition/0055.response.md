The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` and `k` are positive integers, with `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= k <= 10^15`. `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers, where each element `nums[i]` satisfies `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`.

The function returns:
- **Case_1:** If the list `nums` is reduced to contain exactly one positive integer, the function returns the value of `ans` plus 1, where `ans` is the total number of elements removed from `nums` that were reduced to 0.
- **Case_2:** If the list `nums` does not end up containing exactly one positive integer, the function returns the total number of elements removed from `nums` that were reduced to 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers and `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers. It returns the total number of elements removed from `nums` that were reduced to 0. If the list `nums` ends up containing exactly one positive integer, it returns this count plus 1.**
