### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.

2. **Initial Count:**
   - The variable `count` is initialized to 2, which is appropriate since the loop starts from 2 and goes up to `m`.

3. **Initial Answer:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This is based on the fact that for every `a` in the range `[1, n]`, the pair `(a, 1)` always satisfies the condition because `a + 1` is always a multiple of `1 * gcd(a, 1) = 1`.

4. **Loop for Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - The loop iterates from `count = 2` to `m`.
   - Inside the loop, `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
   - `g` is calculated as `n / count`. This is the number of multiples of `count` that are less than or equal to `n`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks. This is a condition to ensure that the number of valid pairs does not exceed the range of `a` and `b`.
   - The formula `ans += g / count + 1` is used to add the number of valid pairs for the current `count` to `ans`.
   - `count` is incremented by 1 after each iteration.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The function prints the integer value of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Formula:
- The formula `ans += g / count + 1` is used to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `b` is the current `count` and `a` is a multiple of `b` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- The variable `g` represents the number of multiples of `b` that are less than or equal to `n`.
- The term `g / count` calculates the number of valid `a` values for the current `b` (i.e., `count`).
- Adding 1 to `g / count` accounts for the fact that `a` can be `b` itself, which is always a valid pair.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as described.
- The logic for counting valid pairs is sound and follows the problem's constraints.
- The loop and the conditions ensure that the program does not exceed the given limits and correctly calculates the number of valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided.

Correctness: **True**
