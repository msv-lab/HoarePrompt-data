Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program is incomplete and does not fully implement the required functionality to solve the problem. Specifically, `func_3` is not implemented, and the logic in `func_2` does not correctly handle the problem requirements. For example, the program does not correctly identify the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations. Here is a potential case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
Input:
1
3 3
2 2 8
```

**Expected Output:**
```
96
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will not produce the correct output because `func_3` is not implemented, and `func_2` does not correctly identify the maximum sum of a subarray to be used in the operations. The logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not handle the problem requirements correctly.
