Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`, `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, `c` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes `c` to 0. Since `c` is now 0, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, `maxi` remains unchanged unless the previous value of `maxi` was less than 0, which is not possible given the initial state. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `ele`) are not affected by this code snippet.
