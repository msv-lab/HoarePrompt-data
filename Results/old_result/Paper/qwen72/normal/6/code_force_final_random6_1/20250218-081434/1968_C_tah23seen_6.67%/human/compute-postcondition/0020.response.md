The code snippet `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` modifies the value of `ans[i + 1]` by adding the value of `ans[i]` to it. Given the initial state, we need to consider the specific values of `ans[0]` and `ans[1]` and how they are affected by this operation.

Initial State:
- `ans[0]` remains `arr[0] + 1`
- `ans[1]` is now `3 * arr[0] + 2 + (arr[0] + 1)`
- All other elements in `ans` remain unchanged
- `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to `3 * arr[0] + 2 + (arr[0] + 1)`

Step-by-step Impact:
1. The value of `ans[i + 1]` is updated by adding the value of `ans[i]` to it.
2. If `i` is 0, then `ans[1]` is updated to `ans[1] + ans[0]`.
3. The value of `ans[0]` remains `arr[0] + 1`.
4. The value of `ans[1]` becomes `3 * arr[0] + 2 + (arr[0] + 1) + (arr[0] + 1)`.
5. Simplifying the expression for `ans[1]`: 
   - `ans[1] = 3 * arr[0] + 2 + arr[0] + 1 + arr[0] + 1`
   - `ans[1] = 5 * arr[0] + 4`

Output State: **`ans[0]` remains `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is now `5 * arr[0] + 4`, all other elements in `ans` remain unchanged, including the condition that `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to `3 * arr[0] + 2 + (arr[0] + 1)`**.
