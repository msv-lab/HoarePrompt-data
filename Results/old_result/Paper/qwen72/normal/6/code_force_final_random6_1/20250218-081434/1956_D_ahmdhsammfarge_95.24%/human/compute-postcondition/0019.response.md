Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, `r` is 0, `l` is the index j where the condition `sm > over_sum` was last satisfied, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop, and `i` is 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The list `lst` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- The variable `r` is always 0 because the loop only updates `l` and `over_sum`.
- The variable `l` is updated to the index `j` where the condition `sm > over_sum` was last satisfied. If the condition was never satisfied, `l` remains 0.
- The variable `over_sum` is updated to the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop. If the condition `sm > over_sum` was never satisfied, `over_sum` remains the sum of all integers in `lst`.
- The variable `i` remains 0 because it is not modified within the loop.

The loop iterates through all possible pairs of indices `(i, j)` where `i` is fixed at 0 and `j` ranges from 1 to `len(lst) - 1`. For each pair, it calculates `sm` and checks if it is greater than `over_sum`. If it is, `l` and `over_sum` are updated. After all iterations, `l` will be the last index `j` where `sm` was greater than `over_sum`, and `over_sum` will be the maximum value of `sm` found.
