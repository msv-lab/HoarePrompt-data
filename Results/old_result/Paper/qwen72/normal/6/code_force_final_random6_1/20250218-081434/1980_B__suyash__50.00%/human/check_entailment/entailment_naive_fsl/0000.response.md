Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the favorite cube has the same value as other cubes, and the position of the favorite cube is ambiguous after sorting. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```

The program will output "MAYBE" for this case, but the correct output should be "MAYBE" only if the favorite cube could be in a position that is either removed or not removed. However, the program's logic does not correctly account for the possibility that the favorite cube could be in a position that is not removed, even if it has the same value as other cubes that are removed.

In this specific example, the favorite cube (index 2) has the value 3. After sorting, the list could be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`, and the favorite cube could be in the second, third, or fourth position. Since `k = 2`, the first two cubes will be removed, and the favorite cube could be either removed or not removed. The program should output "MAYBE" for this case, but it does not handle this correctly.
