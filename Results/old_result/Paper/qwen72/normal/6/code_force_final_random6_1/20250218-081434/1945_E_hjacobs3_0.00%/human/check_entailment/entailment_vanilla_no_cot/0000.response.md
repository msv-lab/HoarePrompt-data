Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation in `func_1` is incorrect. The binary search should stop when `r - l == 1`, but the current implementation stops when `l <= r`. This can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Output Format**: The function `func_1` is supposed to return the number of operations and the indices of the swaps, but it prints the number of operations directly inside the function. This is not consistent with the expected output format.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program does not handle the output for multiple test cases correctly. It should print the number of operations and the indices of the swaps for each test case, but it only prints the number of operations.

4. **Swapping Logic**: The program does not actually perform the swaps on the array. It only returns the indices where the swaps should be performed, but the actual swapping is not done.

5. **Binary Search Result**: The binary search result is not checked for correctness. The program assumes that the binary search will always find the correct position, but this is not guaranteed without the necessary swaps.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    print(res[0])  # Number of operations
    for swap in res[1:]:
        print(' '.join(map(str, swap)))  # Indices of the swaps
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    target_index = array.index(find)
    
    # Binary search to find the position where x should be
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    # If the binary search found the correct position, no swaps are needed
    if l == target_index:
        return [0]
    
    # If the target is not in the correct position, perform the necessary swaps
    operations = []
    if l != target_index:
        operations.append((l + 1, target_index + 1))
        array[l], array[target_index] = array[target_index], array[l]
    
    # Perform the binary search again to ensure the correct position
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    if l == target_index:
        return [len(operations)] + operations
    else:
        # If still not in the correct position, perform another swap
        for i in range(n):
            if i != l and array[i] <= find:
                operations.append((l + 1, i + 1))
                array[l], array[i] = array[i], array[l]
                break
        return [len(operations)] + operations
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Binary Search**: The binary search is implemented correctly to find the position where `x` should be.
2. **Swapping Logic**: The program performs the necessary swaps to ensure that `x` is in the correct position after the binary search.
3. **Output Format**: The program correctly prints the number of operations and the indices of the swaps for each test case.
4. **Multiple Test Cases**: The program handles multiple test cases by printing the results for each test case separately.

This corrected program should now work as expected for the given problem.
