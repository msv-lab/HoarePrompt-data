Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is `t - 1`, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each of the t test cases, `y` is `x - 1` which is an integer such that 1 <= y <= 999 for each of the t test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` from user input, where `2 <= x <= 1000`. It then calculates `y` as `x - 1` and prints the value of `y` for each test case. The function does not return any values. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, the value of `x - 1` has been printed.
