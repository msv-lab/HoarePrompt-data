To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2.
2. **List `a`**: The list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, we know that `i` is 2, and for `a[i]` to be valid, the list `a` must have at least 3 elements (since `i` is 2, and list indices start at 0).

3. **`a[i]`**: The value of `a[i]` is the element at index 2 of the list `a`. Since the exact values of the elements in `a` are not provided, we can only describe `a[2]` in general terms.

4. **`end=' '`**: The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output does not end with a newline but with a space.

### Output:
The code will print the element at index 2 of the list `a` twice, followed by a space. Since the exact value of `a[2]` is not provided, we will use a placeholder to describe it.

Output: **[a[2]] [a[2]] (where a[2] is the element at index 2 of the list `a`)**
