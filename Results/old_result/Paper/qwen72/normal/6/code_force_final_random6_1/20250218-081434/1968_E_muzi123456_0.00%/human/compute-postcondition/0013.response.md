Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is `n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value of `n`. This is because the loop starts with `i` set to 1 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` is equal to `n`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial values, as they are not modified within the loop. The loop will have printed '1' followed by each integer from 1 to `n` on separate lines.
