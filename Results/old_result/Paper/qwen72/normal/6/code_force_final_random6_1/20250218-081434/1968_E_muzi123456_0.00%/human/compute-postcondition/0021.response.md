The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 48, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is 2**
