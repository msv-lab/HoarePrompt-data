Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate the participants based on their preferences. Here's a breakdown of the functions and their correctness:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, it checks if there are enough universals to form a complete tent with the remaining extroverts.
   - If there are not enough universals to form a complete tent, it returns `None` (indicating it's impossible).
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function combines the results from `func_1` with the number of introverts.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` and returns the total number of tents needed.

The program handles all the edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, ensuring that it correctly outputs the minimum number of tents or -1 if it's impossible. Therefore, the program is correct.
