To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute if the result of `int(input())` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the `range` function and will start at 0.

Given the context of the task, the loop is expected to run for the number of test cases `t` provided by the input. Therefore, the input must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**
