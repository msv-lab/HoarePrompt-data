Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer less than or equal to 52. If `n` > 27, `word` is the string 'a' concatenated with the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string, and then concatenated with 'z'. If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'. Otherwise, `word` is 'aa' followed by the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet.***
