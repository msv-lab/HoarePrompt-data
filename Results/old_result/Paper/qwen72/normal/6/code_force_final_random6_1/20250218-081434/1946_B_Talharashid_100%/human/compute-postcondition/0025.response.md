Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is the sum of the non-negative integers in the list `l` that have not been interrupted by a negative integer with an absolute value greater than or equal to the current sum, and `maxi` is the maximum sum of contiguous non-negative integers in the list `l` that have not been interrupted by such a negative integer.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The variable `i` remains 0.
- The variables `n` and `k` remain as positive integers within their specified ranges.
- The list `l` remains unchanged.
- The variable `c` will be the sum of the non-negative integers in the list `l` that have not been interrupted by a negative integer whose absolute value is greater than or equal to the current sum of non-negative integers.
- The variable `maxi` will be the maximum sum of contiguous non-negative integers in the list `l` that have not been interrupted by such a negative integer.
