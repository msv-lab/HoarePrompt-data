Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are lists that may have been modified based on the conditions in the loop body. If `lit[2]` > `x` (where `x` is either infinity or the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty), then `y` is the last element of `b` which is now `lit[2]`. Otherwise, if `lit[2]` > `y` (where `y` is either infinity or the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty), then `lit[2]` is appended to `a`. If neither condition is met, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
