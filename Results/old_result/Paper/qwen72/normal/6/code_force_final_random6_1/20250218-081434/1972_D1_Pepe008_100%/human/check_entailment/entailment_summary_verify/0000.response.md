### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The program provided does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Let's break down the issues and validate the original assessment:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case by reading `a` and `b`.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `suma` using the formula:
     ```python
     x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
     ```
     This formula is not derived from the problem's conditions. The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Condition Checks:**
   - The program includes additional checks:
     ```python
     if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
         suma += x
         if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
             suma += 1
     ```
     These checks are also not aligned with the problem's conditions. The conditions \( (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 \) and \( i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0 \) do not ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - For the test case \(1, 2, 3\):
     - The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
     - The program outputs 1, which is incorrect. The expected output is 3.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done using the following steps:
     - For each test case, iterate over all \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) and \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
     - For each pair \((a, b)\), calculate \(\gcd(a, b)\) using `math.gcd`.
     - Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
     - Count the number of valid pairs and print the result.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program provided is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The original assessment correctly identified the flaw in the program's logic and provided a valid test case to demonstrate the incorrectness.
