Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `cp` is 0, `i` is 3, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element, plus 1.** 

The code snippet `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
