Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is a positive integer (n â‰¥ 2).
- `i` is 1.
- If `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without modifying `n` or `i`.

Given this information, the `print(i)` statement will execute after the condition is checked. Since `i` is 1, and the precondition states that the program continues if `i` is a key in `mpp`, we can infer that `i` is indeed a key in `mpp`.

Therefore, the value of `i` is 1, and this is what will be printed.

Output: **1**
