Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `h` is 12, `m` are integers derived from the input string `s`.**

The code snippet does not change any of the variables except for `day`, which is explicitly set to 'AM'. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that `day` is now specifically 'AM'.
