Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 32, `s` is an input string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `q` is 1, `ac` is 0, and `bc` is the number of 'B' characters in `s`**

The value of `ac` is reset to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. `t` is still an integer between 2 and 32, `s` is still a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B', `q` is still 1, and `bc` is still the number of 'B' characters in `s`.
