The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of different ticket types, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `m` is an integer representing the number of tickets available for each type, with the constraint 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9.
- `k` is an integer representing the number of tickets to buy, with the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9).
- `prices` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer represents the price of one ticket of a particular type, with the constraint 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.

The function returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (number of ticket types), `m` (number of tickets available per type), `k` (number of tickets to buy), and `prices` (a list of prices for each ticket type). It returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets.**
