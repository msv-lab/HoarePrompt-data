The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1` and must be less than `n - 1` for the loop to continue.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1` after this increment.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, and `i` must be less than `n - 1`**
