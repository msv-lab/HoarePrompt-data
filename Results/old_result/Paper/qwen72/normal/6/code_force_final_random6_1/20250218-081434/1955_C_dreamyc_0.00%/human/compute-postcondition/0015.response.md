Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing `n-2` positive integers where 1 <= `nums[i]` <= 10^9, `ans` is 1, `a` is the first element that was removed from the left of `nums`, `b` is the last element that was removed from the right of `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `k` >= 2 * `x`, then `a` is updated to `a - x`, `b` is updated to `b - x`, and `k` is updated to `k - 2 * x`. If `k` < 2 * `x`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `a` is 0 or less.**
