Output State: **`a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, where each element in `p` is a unique integer from 1 to `n`, and each element in `a` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9). `s` is a list of two integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha (1 ≤ `s[0]`, `s[1]` ≤ `n`). `k` is a positive integer representing the number of turns in the game (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^9). `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is 0.**

The variable `mx` is initialized to 0, and the initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.
