Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10, consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed.
   - `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s`.
   - The set `a` contains more than one unique character.
   - `i` has taken on the values of all characters in `s` during the loop.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet is a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides information about the string `s` and the set `a`, but it does not affect the `print` statement in any way.
   - The variable `i` is mentioned in the initial state, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `s`, `a`, or `i`.

Output: **YES**
