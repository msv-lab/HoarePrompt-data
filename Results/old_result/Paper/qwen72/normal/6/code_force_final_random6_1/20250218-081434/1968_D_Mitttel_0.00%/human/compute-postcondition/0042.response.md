Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `input` is still a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` remains a list of strings split from the input read by `sys.stdin`, `index` is now `1 + 4 * t + 2 * t * n`, `t` must have been greater than 0 initially, `results` is a list containing the values returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration, `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]` and also the integer value of the string at `data[5 + 2 * n]`, `data[5 + 4 * n]`, and so on, `k` is the integer value of the string at `data[2]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 1]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 1]`, and so on, `PB` is the integer value of the string at `data[3]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 2]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 2]`, and so on, `PS` is the integer value of the string at `data[4]`, `data[5 + 2 * n + 3]`, `data[5 + 4 * n + 3]`, and so on, `p` and `a` are lists of integers from the strings at the corresponding positions in `data` for each iteration, and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for the last iteration.**

In natural language, this means:
- The `input` variable still refers to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`.
- The `data` list remains unchanged and contains the split strings from the input.
- The `index` variable has been updated to `1 + 4 * t + 2 * t * n`, where `t` is the number of iterations the loop ran, and `n` is the integer value read from the input for each iteration.
- The `results` list contains the results of `func_1` for each of the `t` iterations.
- The variables `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` have been updated for each iteration of the loop, with their values coming from the corresponding positions in the `data` list.
- The `result` variable holds the value returned by `func_1` for the last iteration of the loop.
