Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise `flag` is False, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index where the first inequality was found, `ans` is the minimum of the lengths of consecutive sequences of `val` in `arr` if any inequality was found, otherwise `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity'), `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is the length of the last consecutive sequence of `val` in `arr` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `cnt` is 0.**

In natural language, this means:
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `arr` remains the list of integers read from input.
- `flag` remains True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise it remains False.
- `i` will be `n-1` if the loop completes without finding any inequality, otherwise it will be the index where the first inequality was found.
- `ans` will be the minimum length of any consecutive sequence of `val` in `arr` if an inequality was found during the loop, otherwise it will remain Decimal('Infinity').
- `val` remains `arr[0]`.
- `cnt` will be the length of the last consecutive sequence of `val` in `arr` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise it will be 0.
