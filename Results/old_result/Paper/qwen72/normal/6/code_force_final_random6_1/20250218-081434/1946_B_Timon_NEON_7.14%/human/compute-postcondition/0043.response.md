Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is [arr[1], 1] if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `new_segment` is an empty list. If `max_segment[0]` > `new_segment[0]`, `max_segment` remains [arr[0] + arr[1], 0], and `segments_variants` is a list containing two elements: the first element is [arr[1], 1, 0] if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `arr[1]`, otherwise it is [0, 0, -1]; the second element is [arr[0] + arr[1], 0, 1]. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`, and `segments_variants` is a list containing one element which is [arr[1], 1, 0] if `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `max_segment[0]` is not greater than `arr[1]`, otherwise it is [0, 0, -1], with an additional element which is `new_segment` appended with the value 1.***
