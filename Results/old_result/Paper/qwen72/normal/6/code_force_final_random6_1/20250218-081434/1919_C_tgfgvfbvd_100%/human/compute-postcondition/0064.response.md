Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 1, `c` is 1 or 2, `a` is equal to `l[1]`.**

The value of `c` is incremented by 1, so if `c` was initially 0, it is now 1, and if it was initially 1, it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
