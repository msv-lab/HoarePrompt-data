Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing `n-2` positive integers where 1 <= `nums[i]` <= 10^9, `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element that was removed from the left of `nums` minus `x`, `b` is the last element that was removed from the right of `nums` minus `x`, `x` is the minimum of the original `a` and `b`, and the current value of `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times `x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated to `b - x`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `nums`, `ans`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `b` is the original `b` minus `x`.
- The condition that `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times `x` still holds.
