Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
   - `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where `hh` is an integer from 00 to 23 and `mm` is an integer from 00 to 59.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `h` and `m` are integers derived from the input string `s`.
   - If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` remains 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is adjusted to be `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is less than or equal to 12 and not 0, `h` remains unchanged and `day` is set to 'AM'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The string `s` is in the format "hh:mm".
   - `h` and `m` are derived from `s`. For example, if `s` is "03:45", then `h` is 3 and `m` is 45.
   - Based on the value of `h`, the `day` variable is set:
     - If `h` is 0, `h` becomes 12 and `day` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is greater than 12, `h` becomes `h - 12` and `day` is 'PM'.
     - If `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM'.
     - If `h` is less than or equal to 12 and not 0, `h` remains unchanged and `day` is 'AM'.
   - The print statement formats `h` and `m` to always be two digits (e.g., 03 for 3) and prints them along with the `day` value.

4. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If `s` is "03:45", then `h` is 3 and `m` is 45. Since `h` is less than or equal to 12 and not 0, `day` is 'AM'.
     - Output: **03:45 AM**
   - If `s` is "15:30", then `h` is 15 and `m` is 30. Since `h` is greater than 12, `h` becomes 3 and `day` is 'PM'.
     - Output: **03:30 PM**
   - If `s` is "12:00", then `h` is 12 and `m` is 00. Since `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM'.
     - Output: **12:00 PM**
   - If `s` is "00:15", then `h` is 0 and `m` is 15. Since `h` is 0, `h` becomes 12 and `day` remains 'AM'.
     - Output: **12:15 AM**

5. **General Output:**
   - The print statement will always output the time in 12-hour format with `AM` or `PM` based on the rules described.

Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day} (where {h:02d} is the hour in 12-hour format, {m:02d} is the minute, and {day} is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the initial state rules)**
