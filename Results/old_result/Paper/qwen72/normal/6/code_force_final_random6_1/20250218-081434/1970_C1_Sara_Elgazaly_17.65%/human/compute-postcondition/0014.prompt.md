Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` does not take any parameters, but based on the problem description, it is implied that the input is provided externally and consists of: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) representing the number of nodes in the tree, an integer t (t=1) representing the number of rounds, a list of n-1 pairs of integers (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing the edges of the tree, and an integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the first and second integers from the input, respectively. `lst` is now a defaultdict of lists.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(x - 1):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    lst[a].append(b)
    lst[b].append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers based on the input, `lst[a]` is a list that now includes `b` as its last element, `lst[b]` is a list that now includes `a` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers based on the new input, `lst[a]` is a list that now includes `b` as its last element, `lst[b]` is a list that now includes `a` as its last element twice.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers based on the new input, `lst[a]` is a list that includes `b` as its last element twice, `lst[b]` is a list that includes `a` as its last element three times.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
