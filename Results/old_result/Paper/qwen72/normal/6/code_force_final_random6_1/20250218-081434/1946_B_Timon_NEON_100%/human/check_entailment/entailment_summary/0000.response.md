**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be output modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1:** This function takes an integer `number` and returns the result of `number % 1000000007`. This is correct for ensuring the output is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - **func_2:** This function is intended to find the segment of the array with the highest sum. However, there are several issues with its implementation:
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array contains all negative numbers.
     - The function does not correctly identify the maximum segment sum. It seems to be mixing up the logic for tracking the current segment and the maximum segment.
     - The function returns a segment with indices, but the problem only requires the sum of the segment.
   - **func_3:** This function is not used in the main program and does not contribute to solving the problem. It initializes a variable `answer` to 0 and does nothing else, returning `None`.

3. **Main Program Analysis:**
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_2(a)` to find the maximum segment sum.
   - If the maximum segment sum is `-1`, it sets it to `0`.
   - It calculates the final answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - It prints the result of `func_1(answer)`.

4. **Issues in the Main Program:**
   - The formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` is incorrect. The correct approach should be to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, which involves repeatedly adding the maximum segment sum to the array.
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly identify the maximum segment sum, leading to potential incorrect results.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the maximum segment sum of the array.
   - If the maximum segment sum is positive, we can repeatedly add this sum to the array `k` times.
   - If the maximum segment sum is non-positive, the best we can do is to add the sum of the entire array `k` times.
   - The final answer should be the sum of the array after `k` operations, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

**Conclusion:**
The provided program is incorrect due to the issues in `func_2` and the incorrect formula used in the main program. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
