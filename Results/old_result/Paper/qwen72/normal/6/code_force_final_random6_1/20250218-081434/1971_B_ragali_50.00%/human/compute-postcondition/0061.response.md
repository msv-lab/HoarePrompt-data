Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed; `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s` including the next character `i` and the current character `i`; `i` is the next character in `s` after the current one.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.add(i)` adds the character `i` to the set `a`.
- Since `i` is the next character in `s` after the current one, and `a` already contains all unique characters from `s` including `i`, adding `i` to `a` does not change the set `a` if `i` is already in `a`.
- If `i` was not already in `a`, it is now added, making `a` a set that includes all unique characters from `s` plus the current character `i`.
- The value of `s` and the description of `i` remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` now contains all unique characters from `s` including the current character `i`.
