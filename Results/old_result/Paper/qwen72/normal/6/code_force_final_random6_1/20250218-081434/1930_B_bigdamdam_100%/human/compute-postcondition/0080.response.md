Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer from the user input, which determines the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and generates a permutation of length `n`. The permutation is constructed such that the even-indexed elements (starting from index 0) are filled with values in descending order starting from `n` and decreasing by 2, and the odd-indexed elements are filled with values starting from `1 + n % 2` and increasing by 2. The function prints the generated permutation for each test case. After the function concludes, the input variables remain unchanged, and the permutations are printed to the console. **
