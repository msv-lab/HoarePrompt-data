### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires simulating a series of operations on an initially empty array.
   - There are two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Append an integer `x` to the array.
     - Type 2: Append `x` copies of the current array to itself.
   - After performing all operations, the program must answer queries about the `k`-th element of the array.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes the number of operations `n`, a list of operations, and a list of queries.
     - It initializes an empty array `array` and an empty list `result` to store the answers to the queries.
     - For each operation:
       - If the operation is of type 1, it appends the value `x` to the array.
       - If the operation is of type 2, it appends only one copy of the current array to itself, which is incorrect according to the problem description.
     - After all operations, it processes the queries by appending the `k`-th element of the array to the `result` list. The `k`-th element is found using `(k - 1) % len(array)` to handle the case where `k` is larger than the length of the array.

3. **Using the Annotated Version:**
   - The annotations confirm that the state of the program is as expected before and after the function calls.
   - The key issue is in the handling of type 2 operations in `func_1`. The annotation correctly states that the array should be extended by `x` copies, but the code only extends it by one copy.

4. **Identifying the Error:**
   - The error in `func_1` is in the handling of type 2 operations. The code should append `x` copies of the current array, but it only appends one copy.
   - The correct way to handle type 2 operations is to use a loop to append `x` copies of the current array, or more simply, to use the `*` operator to repeat the array `x` times and then extend the original array with this repeated array.

5. **Correcting the Error:**
   - The correct implementation for type 2 operations should be:
     ```python
     if op_type == 2:
         array.extend(array * value)
     ```

6. **Checking the Correctness:**
   - After correcting the error, the function should correctly simulate the operations and answer the queries.
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case, which is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original program is incorrect due to the handling of type 2 operations.
- The corrected program, as suggested in the original assessment, is correct and should work as expected based on the problem description.

Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect. The corrected program is correct.)
