To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `q` and `ans`.

### Given State:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and must have at least 1 element.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `r` is an integer.
- `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space.
- If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, where `q` is the first element of `ans`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.

### Loop Head:
```python
for q in ans:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `ans` is not empty.
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ans` must have at least 1 element.
   - `q` is the current element being iterated over in `ans`.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - After the previous iteration, `q` will be the next element in `ans`.
   - If `ans` has more than one element, the loop will execute again with the next element in `ans`.

### Adjusted State:
- `ans` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute one more time.
- `q` will be the second element in `ans`.

### Final State:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and must have at least 2 elements, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, where `q` is the second element of `ans`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.**

This ensures that the loop can execute one more time with the next element in `ans`.
