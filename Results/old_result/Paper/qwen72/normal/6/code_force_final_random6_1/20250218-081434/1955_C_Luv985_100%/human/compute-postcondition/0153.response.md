Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `k` is a positive integer and has been decreased by `mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` where `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, and `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`. `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2`.
- The value of `mi * 2` is subtracted from `k`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
