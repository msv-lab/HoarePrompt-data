The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range limit `10`. The loop can execute one more time if `i` is less than `10`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1, and it must still be less than 10.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros, `total` is 0, `i` is 1, `sum_values[0]` is 0**
