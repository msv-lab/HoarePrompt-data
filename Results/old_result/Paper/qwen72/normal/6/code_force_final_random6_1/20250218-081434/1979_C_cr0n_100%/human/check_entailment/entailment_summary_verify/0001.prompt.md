You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Program:
from math import gcd
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    den = vals[0]
    for x in vals:
        den = func_1(den, x)
    vprod = [den // r for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if den <= 0:
        print(-1)
        return
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `vals` from user input. It then computes a value `den` by applying a function `func_1` to the initial value of `den` (which is the first element of `vals`) and each element of `vals` in sequence. It calculates a list `vprod` where each element is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals` using integer division. The function then updates `den` by subtracting the sum of all elements in `vprod` from it. If the updated `den` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `-1` and returns without any value. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces and returns without any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` outcomes, each with a multiplier `k_i`.
   - We need to bet a certain number of coins `x_i` on each outcome such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - The condition to satisfy is: `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - To ensure that `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`, we can use the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i`.
   - The LCM of the multipliers will help us find a common denominator that ensures the condition is met for all outcomes.

3. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - The LCM is calculated using the formula: `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) // GCD(a, b)`.
   - This function is correct and works as expected.

4. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - This function processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
   - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier `vals[0]`.
   - It then iterates through all multipliers and updates `den` to be the LCM of `den` and the current multiplier `x`.
   - After calculating the LCM, it computes `vprod` as the list of `den // r` for each multiplier `r` in `vals`.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(vprod)`.
   - It checks if `den - sum(vprod) > 0` to ensure that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - If the condition is met, it prints the bets `vprod`.
   - If the condition is not met, it prints `-1`.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The LCM approach ensures that the bets `x_i` are such that the total amount bet `sum(x_i)` is a common multiple of the multipliers `k_i`.
   - By using `den // r` as the bet for each outcome, we ensure that the amount received back for any winning outcome is `k_i * (den // r)`, which is a multiple of `den`.
   - The condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - If `den - sum(vprod) <= 0`, it means there is no way to distribute the coins as required, and the function correctly prints `-1`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where there is no valid distribution of coins by checking if `den - sum(vprod) <= 0`.
   - The function also handles the case where the multipliers are all the same, which is a special case where the LCM is the same as the multiplier.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the bets using the LCM approach and checks the condition to ensure a valid distribution of coins.

### Correctness:
**True**
