Output State: **`t` is greater than 2n + 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block, `ans` is the original value of `ans` (which was 0) plus the minimum of the two integers in `lst`, the length of `lst` is 2, and `l` is an input string.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding the minimum of the two integers in `lst` to it.
- Since `ans` was initially 0, the new value of `ans` is the minimum of the two integers in `lst`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `ans_f`, `lst`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
