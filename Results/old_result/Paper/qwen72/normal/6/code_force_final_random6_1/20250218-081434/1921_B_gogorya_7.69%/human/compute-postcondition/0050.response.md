Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s1` is a new input string, `s2` is an updated input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 1, and `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`. If `hd` > 0, `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 2` and the program skips the rest of the current iteration. Otherwise, `hd` remains equal to `a1 - a2 - 1`.***
