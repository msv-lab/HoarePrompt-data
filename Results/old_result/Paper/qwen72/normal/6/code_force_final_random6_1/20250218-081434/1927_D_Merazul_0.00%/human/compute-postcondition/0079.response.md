Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 3, `n` is `k // 2 + 2` if `u` is `True` and `v` is `True`, or `k // 2` otherwise, `a` is a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, `k` is the last element returned by the function `R()`, `b` is a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `f` is 1 if `i` is in `a` or `b` and either `u` or `v` is `True`, otherwise `f` is 0, `m` is `k // 2 - (u and not v) - (u and not v)`, `i` is 3, `v` is `True` if 3 is in `b` and `False` otherwise, `u` is `True` if 3 is in `a` and `False` otherwise, `k` must be at least 2.**
