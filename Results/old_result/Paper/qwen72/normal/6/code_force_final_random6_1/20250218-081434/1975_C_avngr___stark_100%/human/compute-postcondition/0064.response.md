Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `temp` is a list containing the first three elements of `a` in sorted ascending order. If `temp[1]` > `max`, then `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`. Otherwise, `max` remains 0.***
