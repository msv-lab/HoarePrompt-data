You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and find is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n.
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1
        
    #State: `array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= n, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` >= `find`, or `l` is n if no such index exists. `r` is the largest index such that `array[r]` < `find`, or `r` is -1 if no such index exists.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the result of converting `l + 1` to a string, where `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`, or `n` if no such index exists; the second string is the result of converting the index of `find` in `array` plus 1 to a string.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: `array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= n, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` >= `find`, or `l` is n if no such index exists. `r` is the largest index such that `array[r]` < `find`, or `r` is -1 if no such index exists. Additionally, `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an array (a permutation of integers from 1 to n) and an integer `find` (1 <= find <= n). It returns a list of two strings: the first string is the smallest index plus 1 where the array value is greater than or equal to `find`, or `n` if no such index exists; the second string is the index of `find` in the array plus 1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the result of converting `l + 1` to a string, where `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`, or `n` if no such index exists; the second string is the result of converting the index of `find` in `array` plus 1 to a string.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
