Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`. If `ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]`, then `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of the common elements between the sorted sublist `a[:m]` and the sorted list `b` plus 1, and the frequency of the element `a[r]` in `ca` is less than the frequency of the same element in `cb`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. If `ca[a[r]] >= cb[a[r]]`, then `sm` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
