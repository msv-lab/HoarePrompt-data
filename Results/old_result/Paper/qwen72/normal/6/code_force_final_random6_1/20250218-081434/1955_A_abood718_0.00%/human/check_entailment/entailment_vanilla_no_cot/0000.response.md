Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The given program is incorrect due to a few issues:

1. **Logic for Odd Number of Yogurts**: When the number of yogurts `A` is odd, the program prints the number of pairs `X` and then the cost, which is incorrect. It should directly print the total cost.

2. **Cost Calculation for Odd Number of Yogurts**: The cost calculation for an odd number of yogurts is incorrect. It should be `X * C + B` (where `X` is the number of pairs and `B` is the cost of one additional yogurt), but the program prints `X` and then `X * C + B` on a separate line, which is not the correct format.

3. **Cost Calculation for Even Number of Yogurts**: The cost calculation for an even number of yogurts is correct, but it should be simplified to avoid unnecessary integer conversion.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            X = A // 2
            if A % 2 == 0:
                print(X * C)
            else:
                print(X * C + B)
```

This corrected version ensures that the output is in the correct format and the cost is calculated correctly for both even and odd numbers of yogurts.
