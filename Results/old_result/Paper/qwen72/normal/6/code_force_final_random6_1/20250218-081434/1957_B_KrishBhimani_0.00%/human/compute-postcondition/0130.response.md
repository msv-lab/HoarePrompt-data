Postcondition: ***`arr` contains the indices of the bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `arr`, `c` is `c + 1`, `ans` now contains an additional element which is `1 << i`. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` also contains an additional element which is `k0 - sum(ans[:-1])`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
