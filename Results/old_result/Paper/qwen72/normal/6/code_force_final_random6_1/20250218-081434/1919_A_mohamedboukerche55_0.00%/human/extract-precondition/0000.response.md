Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take two parameters `a` and `b` which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func(a, b):`.**
