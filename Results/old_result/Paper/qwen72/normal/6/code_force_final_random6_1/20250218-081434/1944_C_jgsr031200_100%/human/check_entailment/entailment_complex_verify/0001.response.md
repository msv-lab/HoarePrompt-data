### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and deleting them.
   - Alice appends the element to a new array `c` and wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob deletes the element from `a` and wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty, and the score is the MEX of `c`.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should always try to pick the smallest element that is not already in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should try to pick the smallest element that is not already in `c` to minimize the MEX, but he cannot append it to `c`.

3. **Frequency Analysis**:
   - The array `c` will eventually contain elements that are picked by Alice.
   - If an element appears at least twice in `a`, Bob can always pick one of the duplicates, and Alice can still pick the other.
   - If an element appears only once, Bob can pick it, and Alice will not be able to pick it.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - The program calculates the frequency of each element in `a` using a list `freq`.
   - It then iterates through the elements from 0 to `n` and checks:
     - If the frequency of the element is at least 2, it continues.
     - If the frequency of the element is 1, it increments a counter.
     - If the counter reaches 2 or the frequency of the element is 0, it prints the current element and breaks the loop.

5. **Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the frequency of each element in `a` using a list `freq`.
   - The loop iterates through the elements from 0 to `n` and applies the logic described above.
   - The logic ensures that the first element that cannot be picked by both players (either because it appears only once or not at all) is the MEX of `c`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `a` is empty or contains only one element.
   - It also handles the case where all elements in `a` are the same.

7. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

8. **Verification with Annotated Code**:
   - The initial state of the program is correctly described: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where \(0 \le \text{arr}[i] < \text{len}(\text{arr})\) for all \(i\), and the length of `arr` is \(n\) (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5).
   - The `freq` list is correctly initialized and populated with the frequency of each element in `arr`.
   - The loop iterates through the elements from 0 to `n` and applies the correct logic:
     - It skips elements that appear at least twice.
     - It increments a counter for elements that appear exactly once.
     - It prints the current element and breaks the loop if the counter reaches 2 or the element does not appear at all.
   - The final state of the program is correctly described: the loop either breaks early or completes, and the correct MEX is printed.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. The annotated code confirms that the program's behavior aligns with the expected optimal strategy and handles all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
