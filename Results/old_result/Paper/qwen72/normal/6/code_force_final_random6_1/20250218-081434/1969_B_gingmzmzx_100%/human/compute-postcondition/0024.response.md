Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string with `n` elements, `cnt` is [number of 0s in `s`, number of 1s in `s`], and `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s in `s` for each 0 in `s` plus the sum of the number of 0s in `s` for each 1 in `s` except for the 1s that appear before the first 0.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The initial condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
- **`s`**: The list `s` is fully iterated over, so it still contains `n` elements.
- **`cnt`**: After the loop completes, `cnt[0]` will be the total number of 0s in `s`, and `cnt[1]` will be the total number of 1s in `s`.
- **`ans`**: The variable `ans` is incremented based on the following rules:
  - For each 0 in `s`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if there is at least one 1 before it.
  - For each 1 in `s`, `ans` is incremented by the total number of 0s in `s` minus the number of 0s that have been encountered so far.

Thus, `ans` will be the sum of the number of 1s in `s` for each 0 in `s` plus the sum of the number of 0s in `s` for each 1 in `s` except for the 1s that appear before the first 0.
