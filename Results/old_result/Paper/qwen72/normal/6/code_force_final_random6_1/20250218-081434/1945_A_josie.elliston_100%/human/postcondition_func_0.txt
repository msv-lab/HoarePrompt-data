The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, both of which are non-negative integers (0 <= extroverts, universals <= 10^9). If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is less than 3, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, the function returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.
