Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block, `ans` is updated to `ans_f` plus the minimum value of the first two integers in `lst`, and the length of `lst` remains 2 if it was 2, or is reduced by 1 with the element at index 2 removed if it was not 2.**
