The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2, and `t` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` and `m` are the input integers, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is `n + Î£((n / k - (k - 1)) / k + 1) for k from 2 to m`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `n / m - (m - 1)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.**
