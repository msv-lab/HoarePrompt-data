Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum found during the loop, `segments_variants` is a list of all segments that were considered but not chosen as the `max_segment`, `new_segment` is an empty list if the last element of `arr` is less than 0, otherwise it is a list containing the sum of the last segment and the index of the last element in that segment. The `segments_variants` list now includes an additional segment, which is the `new_segment` appended with the index `len(arr) - 1`. `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`.
Code of the loop:
for segment in segments_variants:
    if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
        total_max_segment = segment


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum found during the loop, `segments_variants` is a list of all segments that were considered but not chosen as the `max_segment`, `new_segment` is a list containing the sum of the last segment and the index of the last element in that segment, and the last element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]`, `total_max_segment` is updated to be equal to `segment`, and the current value of `total_max_segment[0]` is greater than the previous value of `total_max_segment[0]`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers where -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum found during the loop, `segments_variants` is a list of all segments that were considered but not chosen as the `max_segment` and must have at least one more segment, `new_segment` is a list containing the sum of the last segment and the index of the last element in that segment, and the last element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]`, then `total_max_segment` is updated to the last segment, and `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` and `max_segment` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers where \(-10^9 \leq arr[i] \leq 10^9\), `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `max_sum` is -1, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum found during the loop, `segments_variants` is a list of all segments that were considered but not chosen as the `max_segment` and must have at least one more segment, `new_segment` is a list containing the sum of the last segment and the index of the last element in that segment, and the last element of `arr` is greater than or equal to 0. If `total_max_segment[0]` (the sum of the current maximum segment) is less than `segment[0]` (the sum of the new segment), then `total_max_segment` is updated to `segment`, and `max_segment` is updated to the segment corresponding to `segment`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` and `max_segment` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
