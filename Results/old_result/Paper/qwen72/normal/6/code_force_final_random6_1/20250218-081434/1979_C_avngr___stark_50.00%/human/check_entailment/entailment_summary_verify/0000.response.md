### Reasoning:

1. **Multiplication of all `k` values**:
   - The program multiplies all the `k` values together to get `m`. This approach is not optimal and can lead to an unnecessarily large `m`. The goal is to find a set of bets such that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. Multiplying all `k` values together does not guarantee that the bets will satisfy this condition.

2. **Incorrect HCF calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list `c`. However, the list `c` is calculated as `m / k[i]`, which is not the correct way to determine the bets. The bets should be determined based on the multipliers `k` in a way that ensures the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. The current approach of calculating `c` as `m / k[i]` and then dividing by the GCD does not ensure this condition.

3. **Sum check**:
   - The program checks if `sum(c) >= m / hcf` and prints `-1` if this condition is true. This check is not always correct because the bets `c` are not calculated correctly in the first place. The sum of the bets should be strictly less than the return for any winning outcome, but the current method of calculating `c` does not guarantee this.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
The correct output should be:
```
27 41 12
```
However, the program will calculate:
- `m = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42`
- `c = [42 / 3, 42 / 2, 42 / 7] = [14, 21, 6]`
- `hcf = gcd(14, 21, 6) = 1`
- `sum(c) = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41`
- `m / hcf = 42 / 1 = 42`

Since `sum(c) < m / hcf`, the program will print:
```
14 21 6
```
However, this is incorrect because:
- If the first outcome wins, you receive `3 * 14 = 42` coins.
- If the second outcome wins, you receive `2 * 21 = 42` coins.
- If the third outcome wins, you receive `7 * 6 = 42` coins.

In all cases, the return is equal to the total bet, not strictly greater. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve finding a set of bets such that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. One possible method is to use the least common multiple (LCM) of the `k` values to determine the bets. However, a simpler and more efficient approach is to use the fact that the bets should be proportional to the reciprocals of the `k` values, scaled to ensure the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly determine the bets to ensure the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
