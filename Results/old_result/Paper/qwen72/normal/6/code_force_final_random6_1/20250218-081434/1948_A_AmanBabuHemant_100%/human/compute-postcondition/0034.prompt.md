You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The function should return a string "NO" if no suitable string can be constructed, or a string "YES" followed by a valid string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, and the length of the string should not exceed 200.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is 0, and for each input integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50) provided during the loop, if `n` is odd, "NO" was printed. If `n` is even and the length of the string `s` (constructed as 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times) is less than 200, "YES" followed by the string `s` was printed. If `n` is even and the length of the string `s` is 200 or more, "NO" was printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and returns "NO" if no suitable string can be constructed. Otherwise, it returns "YES" followed by a valid string of uppercase Latin letters containing exactly `n` special characters, with the total length of the string not exceeding 200 characters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
