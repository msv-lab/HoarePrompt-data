Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of `n` zeros with `p[0]` set to `n` and `p[2]` set to `n - 2`, `ind` is equal to `n - 2`**

Explanation: The code snippet `p[i] = ind` updates the list `p` at index `i` (which is 2) with the value of `ind` (which is `n - 2`). The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
