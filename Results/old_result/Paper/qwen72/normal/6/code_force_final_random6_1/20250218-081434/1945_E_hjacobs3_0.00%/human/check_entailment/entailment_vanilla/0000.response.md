Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `x`, followed by the permutation `array`.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The function `func_1` performs a binary search on the array. However, there is a small issue in the binary search logic:
   - The initial values of `l` and `r` are set to `0` and `n - 1` respectively, which is correct for a 0-indexed array.
   - The loop condition is `while l <= r`, which is also correct for a binary search.
   - The midpoint calculation `mid = (l + r) // 2` is correct.
   - The condition `if array[mid] >= find` should actually be `if array[mid] <= find` to match the problem's requirement for binary search (since we want to move `l` to `mid` if `array[mid] <= find`).

3. **Swapping Logic**: After the binary search, the program checks if the element at position `l` is equal to `x`. If not, it prints `1` and returns the indices to swap the element at position `l` with the element at the position of `x` in the array. This is a valid approach to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search.

4. **Output Handling**: The program prints the number of operations and the indices of the swaps correctly. However, it should print the number of operations before the indices, and it should handle the case where no swaps are needed by printing `0` and not returning any indices.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases where the permutation is already sorted or where the element `x` is at the beginning or end of the array. The current logic seems to handle these cases correctly, but the binary search condition needs to be fixed.

6. **Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a while loop to process each test case.

Given the above points, the main issue is the incorrect condition in the binary search. Let's correct the condition and ensure the output format is correct.

Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(1)
        print(' '.join(res))
    else:
        print(0)
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n - 1)
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    if l - 1 != array.index(find):
        return [str(l), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
    else:
        return None
```

Correctness: **False**

The original program has a logical error in the binary search condition, which would lead to incorrect results in some cases. Additionally, the output format for the number of operations and the indices of the swaps is not handled correctly. The corrected program addresses these issues.
