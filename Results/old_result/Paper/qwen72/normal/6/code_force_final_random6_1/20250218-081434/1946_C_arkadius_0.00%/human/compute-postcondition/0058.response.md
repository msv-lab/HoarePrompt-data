Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `v` is the last vertex in the stack, `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` remain unchanged, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`.**

The value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated by adding the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` to it. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
