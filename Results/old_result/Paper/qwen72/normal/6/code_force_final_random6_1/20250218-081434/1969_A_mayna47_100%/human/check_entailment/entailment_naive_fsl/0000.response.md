Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it assumes that if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, then the answer is 2. However, this is not always correct. Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```

Output:
```
3
```

The program will output 2, which is incorrect. In this case, there is a cycle of length 4 (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1), and to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, Monocarp needs to send invitations to 3 friends, as shown in the problem description. The program fails to account for cycles of length greater than 2.
