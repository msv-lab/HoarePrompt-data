Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `tc` is either 2 or 3.
- `N` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `i` is 2.
- `cnt` is a defaultdict with default type int, which means it will return 0 for any key that is not explicitly set.
- `cnt[a[j]]` is the count of how many times the element `a[j]` appears in the list `a` for each `j` from 0 to `N-1`.
- If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is now 1.
- If `cnt[i]` is 0 or `t` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- Otherwise, `t` remains 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- The `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of `i`.

### Output:
Output: **2**

### Explanation:
- The variable `i` is set to 2 in the initial state.
- The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 2.
- The other variables and conditions (like `cnt`, `t`, etc.) do not affect the value of `i` or the `print` statement in this context.
