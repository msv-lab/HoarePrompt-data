t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), representing the number of piles and the initial number of stones in each pile, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
