Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is a positive integer (n â‰¥ 1).
- `i` is 0.
- `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp`.
- `mpp[i]` is 1.
- `first` is True.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly given as 0, the `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
