Postcondition: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `v` is the new last vertex in the stack, `postorder` is True, the stack does not contain any children of `v` as the last elements, the stack still contains at least one tuple, `tree.vertices[v].children` must contain at least one child, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is now equal to its previous value plus `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, and the remaining size of the component rooted at `u` is greater than or equal to `x`.**
