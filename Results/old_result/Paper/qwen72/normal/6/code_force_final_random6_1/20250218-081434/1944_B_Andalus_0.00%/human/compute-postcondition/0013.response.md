The code snippet `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends the second element of the list `lft` to the list `ldb`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋.
- `T` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is not relevant for the loop to execute.
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `lft` is the first n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
- `rgt` is the last n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
- `ldb` is an empty list.
- `rdb` is an empty list.
- `sng` is an empty list.
- `i` is 1.
- The second element of `lft` is equal to the first element of `lft`.

After executing the code snippet:
- The list `ldb` now contains the second element of `lft`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Since the second element of `lft` is equal to the first element of `lft`, the value appended to `ldb` is the same as the first element of `lft`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `lft` is the first n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is the last n elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is a list containing the first element of `lft`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and the second element of `lft` is equal to the first element of `lft`.**
