The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n). The total number of test cases t is provided, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
