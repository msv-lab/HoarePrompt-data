Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a new input string with length greater than 2, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index 0 and ending at index 2 (inclusive).**

Explanation:
- The code `s = a[i:i + 3]` creates a substring `s` from the string `a` starting at index `i` (which is 0) and ending at index `i + 3` (which is 2, since slicing in Python is exclusive of the end index).
- The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `ans`, `i`, and `_` remain unchanged except for the new variable `s` which is now assigned the value of the first three characters of `a`.
