The provided code snippet is:
```
print(1)
```

Based on the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `_` is a placeholder variable incremented by 1.
- `n` and `k` are the first and second integers in the input line, respectively.
- If `n` is equal to `k`, the current values of `n` and `k` remain equal.
- If `n` is not equal to `k`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` or `n + 2 <= k * 2` holds, depending on the values of `n` and `k`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the integer `1`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **1**
