The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `_` is a placeholder variable that is incremented by 1.
   - `n` and `k` are the first and second integers in the input line, respectively.
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, the current values of `n` and `k` remain equal.
   - If `n` is not equal to `k`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` or `n + 2 <= k * 2` holds, depending on the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `_`, `n`, or `k`.
   - The string `'YES'` is a constant and will be printed regardless of the values of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
