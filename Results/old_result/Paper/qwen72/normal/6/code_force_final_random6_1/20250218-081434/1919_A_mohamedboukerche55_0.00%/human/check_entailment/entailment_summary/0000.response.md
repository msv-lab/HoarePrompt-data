Reasoning:  
The provided program has a logical flaw. It reads multiple test cases but only processes the last one. The program should process each test case independently and print the result for each one. Additionally, the logic to determine the winner based on the sum of coins in the wallets is incorrect. The game's outcome depends on the parity of the number of moves each player can make, not just the sum of the coins. 

To determine the winner, we need to consider the following:
- If both players have an equal number of coins, the player who starts (Alice) will lose because the number of moves will be even, and the last move will be made by Bob.
- If the number of coins is different, the player with more coins will always win if they play optimally. They can force the other player into a position where they have fewer coins and eventually cannot make a move.

The correct logic should be:
- If `a` and `b` are equal, Bob wins.
- If `a` and `b` are different, Alice wins.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program should print the result for each test case, not just the last one.

Correctness: **False**
