You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and k is an integer such that 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        lft = lst[:n]

                break
            if k - sz >= 2:
                print(elem, elem, end=' ')
                sz += 2

        print()
        
        sz = 0
        
        for elem in rdb:
            if sz >= k:
                break
            if k - sz >= 2:
                print(elem, elem, end=' ')
                sz += 2
        
        for elem in sng:
            if sz >= k:

    #State: The loop has completed all `T` iterations. `sz` is the total number of elements printed from `ldb` and `sng` in the first half of the loop and from `rdb` and `sng` in the second half of the loop, which is `min(k, 2 * len(ldb)) + min(len(sng), k - min(k, 2 * len(ldb))) + min(k, 2 * len(rdb)) + min(len(sng), k - min(k, 2 * len(rdb)))`. `ldb` and `rdb` contain all elements that appeared consecutively in `lft` and `rgt`, respectively. `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous or next elements, and the same for `rgt`. The elements in `sng` that were printed are no longer in `sng`. The elements in `ldb` and `rdb` that were printed are no longer in `ldb` and `rdb`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `a` of integers of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. It returns a list of k pairs of indices (i, j) where `a[i]` is equal to `a[j]` and i < j.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
