The code snippet `heappush(min_heap, e)` pushes the element `e` into the `min_heap`. Since `min_heap` is a valid min-heap with no tuples `(value, index)` where `index <= 0`, and `i` is `d + 2`, the only change is that `min_heap` now includes the element `e`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`min_heap` is a valid min-heap with the element `e` added, `i` is `d + 2`, `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, and there are no tuples `(value, index)` in `min_heap` where `index <= 0`.**
