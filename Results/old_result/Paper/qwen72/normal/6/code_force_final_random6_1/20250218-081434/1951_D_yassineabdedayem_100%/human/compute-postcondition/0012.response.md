Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `_` is a placeholder variable.
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from the standard input, where `n` and `k` are the first and second integers in the input line, respectively.
   - `n` is not equal to `k`.
   - The current value of `n` plus 2 is greater than the current value of `k` times 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `1`.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `_` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always output the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `_`.

Output: **1**
