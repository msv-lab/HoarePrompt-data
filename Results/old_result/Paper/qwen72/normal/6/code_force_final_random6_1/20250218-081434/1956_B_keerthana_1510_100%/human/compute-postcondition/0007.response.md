The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`. `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the sequence `a`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process the given list `a` and return a result based on the constraints and relationships between `t`, `n`, and `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers. Each integer in `a` appears at most twice, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns a result based on the input parameters.**
