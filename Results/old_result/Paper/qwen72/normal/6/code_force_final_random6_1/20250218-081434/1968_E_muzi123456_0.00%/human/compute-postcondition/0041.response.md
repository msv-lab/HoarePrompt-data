Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 47, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is `n`**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop. The variable `n` also remains unchanged because it was only used to define the range of the loop and was not modified within the loop body. The variable `i` will have the value `n` because the loop iterates from 1 to `n` inclusive, and the last value `i` takes on is `n`.
