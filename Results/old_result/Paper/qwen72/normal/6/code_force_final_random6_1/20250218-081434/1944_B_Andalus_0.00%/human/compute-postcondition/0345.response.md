Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the number of elements processed in `rdb`.
   - `elem` is the last element in `rdb` that was processed before the loop broke or finished.
   - `rdb` must have at least enough elements to satisfy the condition `sz < k` before the loop breaks.
   - `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `sng` must have at least 1 element.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop or if statement is exited.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is printing the value of `elem` and using `end=' '` to ensure that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.
   - `elem` is the last element in `rdb` that was processed before the loop broke or finished. This means `elem` is a specific element from the list `rdb`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `elem` is the last element processed in `rdb`, it will be printed followed by a space.
   - The exact value of `elem` is not provided in the initial state, but it is known to be the last element processed in `rdb`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `elem` followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the last element processed in the list rdb)**
