Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is `2n` (or `2n + 1` depending on the previous value), `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans`, `ans` is 0, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` using a space as the delimiter.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block. If `len(lst) != 2`, `ans` is the minimum value of the first two integers in `lst` before the removal, and the length of `lst` is reduced by 1 with the element at index 2 removed. If `len(lst) == 2`, `ans` is the minimum of the two integers obtained from splitting `l` using a space as the delimiter, and the length of `lst` remains 2. In both cases, the function either continues or breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block. If `len(lst) != 2`, `ans` is updated to `ans_f` plus the minimum value of the first two integers in `lst`, and the length of `lst` is reduced by 1 with the element at index 2 removed. If `len(lst) == 2`, `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`, and the length of `lst` remains 2. In both cases, the function either continues or breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block. If the length of `a` is not 2, `ans` is increased by the minimum value of the first two integers in the list `a`, and the third element of `a` is removed, making `a` a list of 2n-1 integers. If the length of `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between the first and second elements of `a`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
