Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. For each test case, it generates a list `ans` of length `n` such that the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k`. The elements in `ans` are powers of 2 corresponding to the positions of 1s in the binary representation of `k`, up to `n-1` elements. If the number of 1s in the binary representation of `k` is less than `n`, the remaining elements in `ans` are set to 0. If the number of 1s is exactly `n-1`, the last element in `ans` is adjusted to ensure the sum equals `k`. The function prints the list `ans` for each test case. **
