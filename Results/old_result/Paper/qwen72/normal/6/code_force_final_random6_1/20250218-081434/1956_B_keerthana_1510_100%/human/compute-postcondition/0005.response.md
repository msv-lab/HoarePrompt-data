Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the sequence `a`.
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - The next `line` to be processed is the fifth line.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `line.split()` method splits the string `line` into a list of tokens based on whitespace.
   - The `tokens` variable is assigned the result of `line.split()`.
   - The `len(tokens)` function returns the number of tokens in the list.
   - The `{*tokens}` expression creates a set from the list `tokens`, which removes any duplicate tokens.
   - The `len({*tokens})` function returns the number of unique tokens in the list.
   - The expression `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` calculates the difference between the total number of tokens and the number of unique tokens, which gives the number of duplicate tokens in the list.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the number of duplicate tokens in the `line`.

Since the exact content of the `line` is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of the output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the number of duplicate tokens in the `line`.

Output: **number of duplicate tokens in the `line` (where `line` is the fifth line to be processed)**
