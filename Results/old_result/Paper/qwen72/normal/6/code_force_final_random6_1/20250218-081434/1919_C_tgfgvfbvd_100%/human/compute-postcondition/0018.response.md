Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 0, and `a` and `b` are updated based on the value of `l[0]`. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is set to `l[0]` and `b` remains `float('inf')`. If `l[0]` is greater than `a` and less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is set to `l[0]` and `c` remains 0. If `l[0]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is set to `l[0]`, `b` remains `float('inf')`, and `c` is set to 1.***
