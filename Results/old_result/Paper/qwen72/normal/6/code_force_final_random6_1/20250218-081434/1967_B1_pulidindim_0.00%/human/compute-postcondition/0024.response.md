Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 5, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (g / 4 + 1)`, `countmins` is 4, `g` is equal to `n / 5`, and `m` must be greater than or equal to 5.**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `n / 5`.
- The initial value of `g` (which was `n / 4 - 3`) is no longer valid.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
