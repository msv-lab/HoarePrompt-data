Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if Bob can form a different rectangle from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. The key to solving this problem is to understand that Bob can only form a different rectangle if at least one of the sides of the original rectangle can be divided into two equal parts, and the resulting pieces can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

Given the function `func_1(a, b)`, it only checks if `b` is an even number and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise. However, this approach is incomplete because it does not consider the possibility of cutting the rectangle along the `a` side. The correct logic should be to check if either `a` or `b` is even, because if either dimension is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two equal parts and rearrange them to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

For example:
- For a \(2 \times 6\) rectangle, `b` is even, so the function correctly returns 'yes'.
- For a \(3 \times 2\) rectangle, `a` is odd, but `b` is even, so the function correctly returns 'yes'.
- For a \(2 \times 1\) rectangle, both `a` and `b` are odd, so the function correctly returns 'no'.
- For a \(1 \times 1\) rectangle, both `a` and `b` are odd, so the function correctly returns 'no'.
- For a \(2 \times 2\) rectangle, both `a` and `b` are even, so the function correctly returns 'yes'.
- For a \(2 \times 4\) rectangle, `b` is even, so the function correctly returns 'yes'.
- For a \(6 \times 3\) rectangle, `a` is even, but `b` is odd, so the function should return 'yes' but it returns 'no'.

Therefore, the function `func_1` is incorrect because it only checks if `b` is even, and it should check if either `a` or `b` is even.

Correctness: **False**
