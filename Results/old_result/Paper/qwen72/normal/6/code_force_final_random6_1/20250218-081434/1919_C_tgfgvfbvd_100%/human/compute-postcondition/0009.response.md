Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `c` is 0, `x` is 0, and the first element of `l` (i.e., `l[0]`) is less than or equal to `a`. Additionally, `a` is equal to `b`.**
