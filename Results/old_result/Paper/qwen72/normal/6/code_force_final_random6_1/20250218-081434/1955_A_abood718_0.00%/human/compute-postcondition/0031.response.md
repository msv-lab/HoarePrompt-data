Output State: **`i` is `int(input()) - 1`, `A`, `B`, and `C` are the integers input by the user, split by spaces. If `B * 2 < C`, there are no changes to the variables. Otherwise, if `A` is even, there are no changes to the variables. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be one less than the total number of iterations specified by the user input, which is `int(input()) - 1`. The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` will retain their values from the last iteration, which are the integers input by the user for that iteration. The variable `X` will only be set if `A` is odd and `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` during the last iteration. If `A` is even or `B * 2` is less than `C`, `X` will not be set. The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` from previous iterations will not affect the final state.
