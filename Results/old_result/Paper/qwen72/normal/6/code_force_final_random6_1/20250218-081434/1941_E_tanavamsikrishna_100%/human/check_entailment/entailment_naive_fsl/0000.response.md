Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than \(d\). Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to calculate the cost of installing supports in a single row, but it does not ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than \(d\). The logic in `func_1` only considers the minimum cost within a sliding window of size \(d\), but it does not enforce the requirement that the distance between supports is \(|j_1 - j_2| - 1 \leq d\). This can lead to incorrect costs being calculated for some rows, which in turn affects the overall minimum cost for building \(k\) bridges.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
3 5 1 2
0 1 2 3 0
```
The correct output should be 6, because the only valid way to build a bridge with supports no more than 2 units apart is to place supports in every cell, resulting in a total cost of \(1 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 6\). However, the program might output a different value because it does not enforce the distance constraint correctly.
