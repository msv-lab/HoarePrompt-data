Postcondition: ***`res` is a list with all elements that satisfy `l[a[j] - 1] == 1` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `ul` is not equal to `ur`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `ur` is increased by 2 and the current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0.***
