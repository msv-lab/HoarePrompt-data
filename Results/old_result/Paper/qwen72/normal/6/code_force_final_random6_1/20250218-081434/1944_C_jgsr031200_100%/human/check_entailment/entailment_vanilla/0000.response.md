### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and deleting them.
   - Alice appends the element to a new array `c` and wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob deletes the element from `a` and wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty, and the score is the MEX of `c`.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should always try to pick the smallest element that is not already in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should try to pick the smallest element that is not already in `c` to minimize the MEX, but he cannot append it to `c`.

3. **Frequency Analysis**:
   - The array `c` will eventually contain elements that are picked by Alice.
   - If an element appears at least twice in `a`, Bob can always pick one of the duplicates, and Alice can still pick the other.
   - If an element appears only once, Bob can pick it, and Alice will not be able to pick it.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - The program calculates the frequency of each element in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the elements from 0 to `n` and checks:
     - If the frequency of the element is at least 2, it continues.
     - If the frequency of the element is 1, it increments a counter.
     - If the counter reaches 2 or the frequency of the element is 0, it prints the current element and breaks the loop.

5. **Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the frequency of each element in `a` using a list `freq`.
   - It then iterates through the elements from 0 to `n` and applies the logic described above.
   - The logic ensures that the first element that cannot be picked by both players (either because it appears only once or not at all) is the MEX of `c`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `a` is empty or contains only one element.
   - It also handles the case where all elements in `a` are the same.

7. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
