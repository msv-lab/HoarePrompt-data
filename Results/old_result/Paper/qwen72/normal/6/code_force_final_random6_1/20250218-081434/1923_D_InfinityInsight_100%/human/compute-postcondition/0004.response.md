Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 3 * 10^5, and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `n` is a non-negative integer such that n = len(a) and n must be greater than 1, `left` is a list containing the integer 0, `last` is a list containing the integer -1, `ans` is a list of length n, where each element is -1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`.**
