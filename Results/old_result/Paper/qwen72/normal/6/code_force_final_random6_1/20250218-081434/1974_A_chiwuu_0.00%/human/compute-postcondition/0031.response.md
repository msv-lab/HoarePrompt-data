Output State: **`t` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`.**

Explanation:
- The code `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` updates the value of `t1`.
- The value of `t1` is now `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
