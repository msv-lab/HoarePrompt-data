The function `func_1` is expected to be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list `p` of length `n` containing integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n; p_i ≠ i; all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends of each friend. The function should calculate and return the minimum number of invitations needed for at least 2 friends to attend the party.

However, the provided function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters and does not return any value. The cases mentioned all state that the program returns nothing, which suggests that the function is incomplete or not properly defined to handle the described task.

Functionality: **The function is expected to accept an integer `n` and a list `p` of integers, and return the minimum number of invitations needed for at least 2 friends to attend the party. However, the function as provided does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
