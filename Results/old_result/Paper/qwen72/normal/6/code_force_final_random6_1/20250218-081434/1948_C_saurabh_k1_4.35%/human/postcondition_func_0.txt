The function reads input from the user for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of columns, and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The function then checks if the character at the second-to-last position in `b` is '<'. If it is, the function prints "No"; otherwise, it prints "Yes". After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
