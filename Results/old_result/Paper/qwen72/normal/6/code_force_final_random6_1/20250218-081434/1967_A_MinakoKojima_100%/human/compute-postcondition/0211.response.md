To determine what will be printed by the `print(a)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables step by step:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This represents the number of test cases.
2. **`_`**: This is `t - 1`. It is not directly used in the `print(a)` statement, but it indicates that `t` is at least 1.
3. **`n` and `k`**: These are input integers. The exact values are not specified, but they are used in the calculations for `ans` and `res`.
4. **`a`**: This is the third element in `ans_list`.
5. **`i`**: This is `n - 2`. It is not directly used in the `print(a)` statement, but it indicates that `n` is at least 2.
6. **`ans`**: The final value after all iterations plus \((ans - 1) \times (n - 1) + res\).
7. **`res`**: The final value after all iterations plus \(k \% n\) if \(k\) is not 0, otherwise `res` remains the final value after all iterations.
8. **`k`**: This is 0 or the remaining value after the last iteration.
9. **`ans_list`**: This list contains `t` elements, each being the value of `ans` for each test case. It must have at least 3 elements.

Given this information, the `print(a)` statement will print the third element in `ans_list`.

Since `ans_list` contains `t` elements, and `t` is at least 1, the list must have at least 3 elements as per the precondition. The third element in `ans_list` is the value of `ans` for the third test case.

However, the exact value of `ans` for the third test case is not provided in the initial state. We can only describe it based on the given formula and conditions.

Output: **a (where a is the third element in `ans_list`, and `ans_list` contains the values of `ans` for each test case)**
