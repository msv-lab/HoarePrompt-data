The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `row` and `d`. `row` is a list of integers representing the depths of a row in the river grid, and `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d < len(row). The function returns the last element of the list `row`, which has been updated based on the smallest tuple in `min_heap` that has an index greater than `len(row) - (d + 2)`. The last element of `row` is updated to `e[0] + row[len(row) - 1] + 1`, where `e` is the smallest tuple in `min_heap` with an index greater than `len(row) - (d + 2)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `row` and a positive integer `d` (1 <= d < len(row)). It returns the last element of `row` after updating it based on the smallest tuple in `min_heap` with an index greater than `len(row) - (d + 2)`. The updated last element is `e[0] + row[len(row) - 1] + 1`, where `e` is the smallest tuple in `min_heap` with the specified index condition.**
