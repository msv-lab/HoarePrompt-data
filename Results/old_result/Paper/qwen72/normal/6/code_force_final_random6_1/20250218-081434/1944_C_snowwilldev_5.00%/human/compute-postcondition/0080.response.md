Output State: **`tc` is 2 or 3, `N` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 0, `t` is 1, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default type int, and `cnt[a[j]]` is the count of how many times the element `a[j]` appears in the list `a` for each `j` from 0 to `N-1`. The current value of `cnt[i]` is 1.**

The value of `t` is incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
