Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (n â‰¥ 2), `i` is 1, `first` is True.**

The variable `first` is set to True, and the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The condition that if `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `first` as True, along with the unchanged values of `n` and `i`.
