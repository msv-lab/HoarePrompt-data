Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first input string, `b` is the integer value of the second input string.**

The code snippet `b = int(b)` converts the value of `b` from a string to an integer. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
