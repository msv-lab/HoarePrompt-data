Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, with leading and trailing spaces removed.
   - `i` is the last character of `s`.
   - `a` contains all unique characters from `s`.
   - The length of `a` is greater than 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
   - The values of `s`, `i`, and `a` are not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - The condition that the length of `a` is greater than 1 is given, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is not dependent on the values of `s`, `i`, or `a`, it will always print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
