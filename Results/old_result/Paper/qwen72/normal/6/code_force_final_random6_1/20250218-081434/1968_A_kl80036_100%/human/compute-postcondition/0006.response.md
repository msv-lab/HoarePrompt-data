Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 (input value), `i` is 1, `y` is `x - 1` which is an integer such that 1 <= y <= 999 (based on the new value of `x`).**

The value of `y` is updated to `x - 1`, which is an integer between 1 and 999 based on the new value of `x`. The other variables `t`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.
