Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string, and `b` is a list of characters from the new input string. For the first half of the list (up to `len(a) // 2 - 1`), each character in `a` is the maximum of the corresponding characters from the initial `a` and `b`, and each character in `b` is the minimum of the corresponding characters from the initial `a` and `b`. For the second half of the list (from `len(a) // 2` to the end), each character in `a` is the minimum of the corresponding characters from the initial `a` and `b`, and each character in `b` is the maximum of the corresponding characters from the initial `a` and `b`. `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(b)):
    print(b[i], end='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string, and `b` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 element; `i` is `len(a) - 1`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string, and `b` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 2 elements; `i` is `len(a)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string, and `b` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least `len(a) + 1` elements; `i` is `len(a) + 1`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
