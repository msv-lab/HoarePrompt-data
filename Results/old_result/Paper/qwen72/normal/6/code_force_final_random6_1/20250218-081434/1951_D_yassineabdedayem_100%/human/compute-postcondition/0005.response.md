The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes the context in which this code is executed but does not affect the value printed by the statement.

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
- `_` is a placeholder variable and is not used in the `print` statement.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the standard input, and they are equal to each other.

The `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
