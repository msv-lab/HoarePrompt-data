To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **`i` is `n - 1`**: This indicates that `i` is the last index of the list `lft` if `lft` has `n` elements.
2. **`n` is unchanged**: The length of the list `lft` remains `n`.
3. **`ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element**: This list is populated with elements from `lft` that are the same as the element immediately before them.
4. **`sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element)**: This list is populated with elements from `lft` that are unique in the sense that they are not the same as the elements immediately before or after them.
5. **`k` is unchanged**: The value of `k` remains the same.
6. **`lst` is unchanged**: The list `lst` remains the same.
7. **`lft` is unchanged**: The list `lft` remains the same.
8. **`rgt` is unchanged**: The list `rgt` remains the same.
9. **`sz` is 4 if `k - sz >= 2` and 2 otherwise**: The value of `sz` is determined by the condition. If `k - 4 >= 2`, then `sz` is 4; otherwise, `sz` is 2.
10. **`_` is `T`**: This variable is set to `T`, which could be a boolean `True` or a string `"T"`. However, it is not used in the `print` statement.
11. **`rdb` must contain at least three elements**: The list `rdb` has at least three elements.
12. **`elem` is the last element in `rdb` that will be processed**: This is the last element in `rdb` that will be used in the processing.
13. **If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**: This condition affects the flow of the program but does not directly impact the `print` statement.

Given these conditions, let's focus on the `print` statement:
```
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

- **`elem`**: This is the last element in the list `rdb` that will be processed. Since `rdb` must contain at least three elements, `elem` is the last element of `rdb`.

The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the last element in the list `rdb`)**
