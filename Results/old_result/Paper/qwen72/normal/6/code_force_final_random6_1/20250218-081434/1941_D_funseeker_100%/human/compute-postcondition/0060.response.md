The code snippet `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the result of the expression `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. The value of `q` is the next element in the set `ans`, and `r` and `n` are assumed to be defined in the context where this code runs. The expression `(q + r) % n` computes the remainder of the sum of `q` and `r` when divided by `n`, and this result is added to `temp`.

Output State: **`ans` is a non-empty set, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `temp` includes the new element `(q + r) % n`.**
