Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block. If the length of `a` is not 2, `ans` is increased by the minimum value of the first two integers in the list `a`, and the third element of `a` is removed, making `a` a list of 2n-1 integers. If the length of `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between the first and second elements of `a`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
