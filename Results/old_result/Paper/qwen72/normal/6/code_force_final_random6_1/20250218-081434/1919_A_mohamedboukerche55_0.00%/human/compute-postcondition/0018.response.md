The function `func` is intended to accept two parameters `a` and `b`, which are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func(a, b):`.

Since the function definition does not include the parameters, it is not possible to determine the return value based on the given information. However, assuming the function is correctly defined as `def func(a, b):`, the expected functionality would be to return some result based on the values of `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function is intended to accept two integer parameters `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. However, the provided function definition is incorrect and does not include these parameters.**
