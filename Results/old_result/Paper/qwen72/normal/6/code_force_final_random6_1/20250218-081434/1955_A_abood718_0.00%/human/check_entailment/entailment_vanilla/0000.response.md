### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if the price of two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is less than the promotion price (`C`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means it is cheaper to buy each yogurt individually, so the total cost is `A * B`.
   - If `A % 2 == 0`, it means the number of yogurts is even. In this case, the program calculates the total cost as `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the cost of buying `A` yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.
   - If `A % 2 != 0`, it means the number of yogurts is odd. The program calculates the number of pairs of yogurts `X = A // 2` and then prints the cost of buying `X` pairs at the promotion price plus one additional yogurt at the regular price `X * C + B`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case in a separate line.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Output for Odd Number of Yogurts:**
  - The program prints `X` before printing the final cost for the odd case, which is unnecessary and incorrect. This will cause the output to be in the wrong format and include an extra line.
  - The correct output should only be the final cost `X * C + B`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Correctness:
- **False** (The original program is incorrect due to the extra print statement in the odd case.)

### Correct Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

Correctness: **True** (The corrected program is correct based on the problem description.)
