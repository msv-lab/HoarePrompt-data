Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` from the input, counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' within `s`, and prints the result of `x + y - z`, where `x` is the count of 'map', `y` is the count of 'pie', and `z` is the count of 'mapie'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The final state of the program includes the last input string `s`, the counts `x`, `y`, and `z` for the last string, and the loop variable `_` which is equal to `a - 1`. **
