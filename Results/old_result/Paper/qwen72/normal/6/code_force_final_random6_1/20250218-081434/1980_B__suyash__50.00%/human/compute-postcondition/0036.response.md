Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` that must have at least 1 element. If `fav` is not equal to the first element of `l`, `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[0]]`. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `fav` is equal to `l[0]`, `k` is updated to `k - dic[l[0]]`. In all cases, if `k` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
