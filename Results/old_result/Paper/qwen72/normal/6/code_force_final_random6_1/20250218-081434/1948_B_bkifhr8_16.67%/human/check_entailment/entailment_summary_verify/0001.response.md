### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.

2. **Operation Simulation**:
   - The program iterates through the array to check if any element is out of order and greater than 10.
   - If such an element is found, it splits the element into its digits and inserts them back into the array at the correct positions.
   - However, the program only performs this operation once for the first out-of-order element greater than 10. This is insufficient because the operation might need to be applied multiple times to different elements to achieve a sorted array.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. The program will split `12` into `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]` but will not split `45` into `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`, which is necessary to achieve a sorted array.

3. **Sorting Check**:
   - After performing the operations, the program checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to a sorted version of itself.
   - The function `func_1` is used to perform this check. It sorts the list and compares it to the original list.
   - This check is correct, but it is only applied after a single operation, which is not sufficient.

4. **Incorrect Condition**:
   - The condition `if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:` is not sufficient to ensure that the array can be sorted. It only checks if the current element is out of order and greater than 10, but it does not consider the possibility of multiple elements needing to be split.
   - This condition also does not handle cases where the array might become sorted after multiple splits, but the program only checks once.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not handle the case where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted array. It only performs the operation once, which is not enough to solve the problem as described.

### Final: **False**
