Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**
The program provided does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the permutation generated by the program may not satisfy the condition that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

**Case where the program fails:**
Consider the input \( n = 4 \). The program generates the permutation \( [4, 1, 2, 3] \). However, this permutation does not satisfy the condition for \( i = 1 \) and \( j = 3 \):
- \( p_1 = 4 \) divides \( p_3 = 2 \) (since \( 4 \div 2 = 2 \))
- \( p_2 = 1 \) divides \( p_4 = 3 \) (since \( 1 \div 3 = 1 \))

Thus, the generated permutation \( [4, 1, 2, 3] \) is invalid according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
