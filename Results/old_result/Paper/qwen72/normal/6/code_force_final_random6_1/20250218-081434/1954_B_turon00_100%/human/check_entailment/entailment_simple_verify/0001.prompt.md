You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

    #State: `t` is 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a` during the loop execution, updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, the output is `-1`. Otherwise, the output is `ans`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - An array is called "beautiful" if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \) where \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer beautiful, or output -1 if it's impossible.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an array length \( n \) and an array \( a \).
   - The output should be the minimum number of elements to remove for each test case, or -1 if it's impossible.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the array length \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and `cnt` to count consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`.
   - It iterates through the array, updating `cnt` for consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`.
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt`.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.
   - If the array length \( n \) is 1 or `ans` is equal to \( n \), it prints -1 (indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful).
   - Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( n = 1 \) by printing -1.
   - The program correctly handles the case where all elements are the same by printing -1.
   - The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element, which is a reasonable approach to identify the smallest segment that can be removed to break the beauty condition.
   - However, the program only checks for consecutive elements equal to the first element, which might not be sufficient. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will incorrectly output 1 because it only checks for consecutive `1`s, but the correct answer is 1 (removing the last `1`).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the array is already non-beautiful (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the array has only one unique element (e.g., `[2, 2, 2]`).

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program only checks for consecutive elements equal to the first element, which might not be the optimal approach. It should consider all possible segments of consecutive elements that can be removed to break the beauty condition.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it only checks for consecutive elements equal to the first element, which is not a comprehensive approach to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
