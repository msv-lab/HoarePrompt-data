Output State: **`t` is equal to `b * 2`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the first input string, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4` (which is now equal to `b * 30 - b * 4` or `b * 26`).**
