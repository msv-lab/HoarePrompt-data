Output State: **`t` is equal to `b * 2 // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is equal to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the first input string, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, and `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t1` is updated to `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- The other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `t1` is calculated based on the current value of `t` and `b`.
