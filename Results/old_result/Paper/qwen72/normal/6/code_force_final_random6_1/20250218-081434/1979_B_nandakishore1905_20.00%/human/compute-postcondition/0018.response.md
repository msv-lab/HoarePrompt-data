Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x â‰  y, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, and `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, the program retains these conditions. If `k` is not a power of 2, and `n` is 0 with `m` being an odd or even integer greater than 0, the program retains these conditions. Otherwise, `l` is a string representing the binary form of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the string `l`, and `q` is 2 raised to the power of `p - 1`.***
