The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `arr`. The loop will execute again if there is at least one more element in `arr` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, and `num` is the first element of `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be the next element in `arr`, and `arr` must still have at least `n` elements.

Given that `num` is the first element of `arr` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `num` will be the second element of `arr` at the start of the next iteration. The list `arr` must still have at least `n` elements for the loop to continue.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_x_key` and value 1, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with a key `mod_y_key` and value 1, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the first element of `arr`**.
