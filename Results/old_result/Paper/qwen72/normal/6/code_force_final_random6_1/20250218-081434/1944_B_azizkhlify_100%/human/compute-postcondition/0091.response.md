Let's break down the precondition and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Precondition Analysis:
1. **`n` is greater than 0**: This indicates that `n` is a positive integer.
2. **`i` is the last element in `res` + 1**: This means `i` is the index of the next element to be processed in the list `a`, assuming `res` is a list of indices.
3. **`k` is `2 * k - ul`**: This is a formula for updating `k` based on the current value of `k` and `ul`.
4. **`res` is a non-empty list that has been fully iterated**: This means `res` contains at least one element, and all elements in `res` have been processed.
5. **`ul` is not equal to `ur` unless the condition `ul == ur` is met**: This indicates that `ul` and `ur` are initially different, but they can become equal under certain conditions.
6. **If `ul == ur`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**: This means if `ul` equals `ur`, the value at `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, and the loop or if statement is exited.
7. **If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `r[a[i] - 1]` remains 0 and `ur` is `ur + 2`**: This means if `ul` is not equal to `ur`, the value at `r[a[i] - 1]` remains 0, and `ur` is incremented by 2.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Determine `i`**: According to the precondition, `i` is the last element in `res` + 1. Since `res` is a non-empty list that has been fully iterated, `i` is the index of the next element in `a` that would be processed if the iteration continued.
2. **Determine `a[i]`**: The value `a[i]` is the element in the list `a` at the index `i`. Since `i` is the next index after the last element in `res`, `a[i]` is the element in `a` at this index.
3. **Output of the `print` statement**: The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `a` and `res` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the variables and the precondition.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element in the list `a` at the index `i`, and `i` is the last element in `res` + 1)**
