Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object representing a tree with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `k` < `n`, `beg` is equal to `end`.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `beg` is less than `end`. During each iteration, `mid` is calculated as the midpoint of `beg` and `end`, and based on the result of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`, either `beg` is updated to `mid` or `end` is updated to `mid - 1`. This process narrows the range between `beg` and `end` until they are equal, at which point the condition `beg < end` becomes false, and the loop terminates. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `beg` will be equal to `end`.
