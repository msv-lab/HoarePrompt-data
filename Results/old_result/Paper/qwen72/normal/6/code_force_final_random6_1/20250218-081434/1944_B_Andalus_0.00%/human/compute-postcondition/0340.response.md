Output State: **`sz` is the minimum of `k` and twice the number of elements processed in `rdb`, `elem` is the last element in `rdb` that was processed before the loop broke or finished. `rdb` must have at least enough elements to satisfy the condition `sz < k` before the loop breaks, and `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`sz`**: After the loop finishes, `sz` will be the minimum of `k` and twice the number of elements processed from `rdb`. This means that if `rdb` has enough elements to reach `k` by adding 2 for each processed element, `sz` will be exactly `k`. Otherwise, `sz` will be twice the number of elements processed from `rdb`.
- **`elem`**: `elem` will be the last element in `rdb` that was processed before the loop either broke (because `sz` reached `k`) or finished (because there were no more elements in `rdb`).
- **`rdb`**: The list `rdb` must have at least enough elements to satisfy the condition `sz < k` before the loop breaks. If `rdb` has fewer elements than needed to reach `k`, the loop will process all elements in `rdb`.
- **`k - sz`**: The difference `k - sz` will be greater than or equal to 0, indicating that the loop either reached the desired `k` value or processed as many elements as possible from `rdb` without exceeding `k`.

All other variables (`i`, `n`, `ldb`, `sng`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
