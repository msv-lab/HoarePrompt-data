Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing `n-5` or `n-4` or `n-3` positive integers where 1 <= `nums[i]` <= 10^9, `ans` is 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4, `a` is the new first element that was removed from the left of `nums`, `b` is the new last element that was removed from the right of `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, `k` is non-zero, `len(nums)` is at least 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
