The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will take on the value of each element in `arr` during each iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 1
- `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`
- `k` is 0
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`
- `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`
- `arr` contains the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`
- `ans` is an empty list
- `c` is 0

To ensure the loop executes, `arr` must have at least one element. The variable `i` will be set to the first element in `arr` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `arr` must have at least one element, `ans` is an empty list, `c` is 0**
