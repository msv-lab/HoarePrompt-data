You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, and bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30.
def find_max(cur_arr, bit):
    if (bit == -1) :
        return len(cur_arr)
        #The program returns the length of the list `cur_arr`, which is a list of non-negative integers.
    #State: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, and bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, and bit is not equal to -1.
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    thing1 = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
        
    #State: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the values of `xor` at the end of each iteration where the bit at position `bit` in `xor` was 0, `xor` is 0 if the last element of `cur_arr` resulted in `xor` having the bit at position `bit` set to 0, otherwise `xor` is the final value after all elements of `cur_arr` have been processed, and `thing1` is 0.
    if (xor >> bit & 1) :
        thing1 = -1
    else :
        thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)
    #State: *`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the values of `xor` at the end of each iteration where the bit at position `bit` in `xor` was 0. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is set to 1, `xor` is the final value after all elements of `cur_arr` have been processed, and `thing1` is -1. Otherwise, if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, `xor` is 0 if the last element of `cur_arr` resulted in `xor` having the bit at position `bit` set to 0, otherwise `xor` is the final value after all elements of `cur_arr` have been processed, and `thing1` is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`.
    if (x >> bit & 1) :
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))
        #The program returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`.
    else :
        return thing1
        #The program returns the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`, where `new_arr` is a list containing the values of `xor` at the end of each iteration where the bit at position `bit` in `xor` was 0. `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` (0 <= bit < 30). It returns the length of `cur_arr` if `bit` is 0. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`, where `new_arr` is a list of values of `xor` where the bit at position `bit` in `xor` was 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the length of the list `cur_arr`, which is a list of non-negative integers.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`.

Case_3: The program returns the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`, where `new_arr` is a list containing the values of `xor` at the end of each iteration where the bit at position `bit` in `xor` was 0. `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
