You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters, which is inconsistent with the problem description.
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: `func` is expected to take two parameters `a` and `b`, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `test` must be an integer such that 1 <= test <= 1000, `t` is `test - 1`, and `a` and `b` are input integers. Regardless of whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd, the state of the variables remains unchanged after all iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the problem and the logic implemented in the code.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Alice and Bob each have a certain number of coins in their wallets, represented by `a` and `b` respectively.
   - Alice makes the first move.
   - Each player can either swap wallets with the other or keep their current wallet.
   - After choosing, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., their wallet is empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Play:**
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.
   - The key to solving this problem is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins `a + b`.

3. **Parity Analysis:**
   - If the total number of coins `a + b` is even, Bob will always win.
   - If the total number of coins `a + b` is odd, Alice will always win.

#### Explanation:
- **Even Total Coins:**
  - If `a + b` is even, the game will always end in an even number of moves.
  - Since Alice makes the first move, Bob will make the last move.
  - Bob will always be able to make a move after Alice, and eventually, Bob will be the one to make the final move when both wallets are empty.

- **Odd Total Coins:**
  - If `a + b` is odd, the game will always end in an odd number of moves.
  - Since Alice makes the first move, Alice will make the last move.
  - Alice will always be able to make a move after Bob, and eventually, Alice will be the one to make the final move when both wallets are empty.

#### Code Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b`.
- It then checks the parity of `a + b` using the bitwise AND operator `&`.
  - `a + b & 1 == 0` checks if `a + b` is even.
  - If `a + b` is even, it prints "Bob".
  - If `a + b` is odd, it prints "Alice".

#### Bitwise AND Operator:
- The expression `a + b & 1` is equivalent to checking the least significant bit of `a + b`.
- If the least significant bit is 0, `a + b` is even.
- If the least significant bit is 1, `a + b` is odd.

#### Correctness:
- The logic implemented in the code correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.
- The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description.

Correctness: **True**
