To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` and `k` are positive integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^4\).
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `c` is the sum of the non-negative integers in the list `l` that have not been interrupted by a negative integer with an absolute value greater than or equal to the current sum.
- `maxi` is the maximum of the current `c` and the previous `maxi`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`2 ** k`**: This is \(2\) raised to the power of `k`. Since `k` is a positive integer, this will be a large power of 2.
2. **`2 ** k * maxi`**: This multiplies the large power of 2 by `maxi`, where `maxi` is the maximum sum of non-negative integers in `l` that have not been interrupted by a negative integer with an absolute value greater than or equal to the current sum.
3. **`2 ** k * maxi - maxi`**: This subtracts `maxi` from the product of \(2\) raised to the power of `k` and `maxi`. This simplifies to \( (2^k - 1) \times \text{maxi} \).
4. **`sum(l)`**: This is the sum of all integers in the list `l`.
5. **`(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`**: This takes the result of the previous expression and applies the modulo operation with \(1000000007\).

### Explanation of Variables:
- **`maxi`**: This is the maximum sum of non-negative integers in `l` that have not been interrupted by a negative integer with an absolute value greater than or equal to the current sum. The exact value of `maxi` depends on the contents of `l`.
- **`sum(l)`**: This is the sum of all integers in the list `l`. The exact value depends on the contents of `l`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the result of the expression \((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \sum l) \mod 1000000007\).

Since the exact values of `k`, `l`, and `maxi` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **\((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \sum l) \mod 1000000007\) (where `k` is a positive integer, `maxi` is the maximum sum of non-negative integers in `l` that have not been interrupted by a negative integer with an absolute value greater than or equal to the current sum, and `sum(l)` is the sum of all integers in the list `l`)**
