Reasoning:  
The provided solution checks if `b` is an even number and returns "yes" if it is, otherwise "no". However, this logic is incorrect for the problem at hand. The problem requires determining whether a rectangle of size `a × b` can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then reassembled into a different rectangle (considering rotations as the same). For Bob to form a different rectangle, at least one of the dimensions (`a` or `b`) must be even and greater than 1, because only then can the rectangle be cut into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with a different aspect ratio.

The current solution only checks if `b` is even, which is not sufficient. For example, for the input `6 3`, the solution incorrectly returns "no" because `b` is odd, even though the rectangle can be cut into two `3 × 3` rectangles and reassembled into a `3 × 6` rectangle, which is considered the same as the original `6 × 3` rectangle.

A correct solution would need to check if either `a` or `b` is even and greater than 1. If either dimension meets this criterion, then Bob can form a different rectangle. If both dimensions are odd or one of them is 1, then Bob cannot form a different rectangle.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
