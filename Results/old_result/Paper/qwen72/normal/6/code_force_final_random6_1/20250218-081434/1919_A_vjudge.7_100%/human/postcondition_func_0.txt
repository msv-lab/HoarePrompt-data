The function `func` reads an integer `test` from the input, representing the number of test cases (1 <= test <= 1000). For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) from the input, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. The function does not return any value, and the state of the input variables remains unchanged after the function concludes.
