### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a while loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Counting Negatives:**
   - The program counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores this count in the variable `neg`.

3. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - The penalty calculation is based on the formula `print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)`.
   - This formula is derived from the observation that the optimal way to minimize the penalty is to split the array such that the sum of each subarray is zero whenever possible.
   - If the number of '+' and '-' characters is not equal (i.e., `n != neg`), the penalty is calculated as `n - 2 * neg`. This is because each '-' character contributes -1 to the sum, and each '+' character contributes 1. The optimal split would balance the number of '+' and '-' characters as much as possible.
   - If the number of '+' and '-' characters is equal (i.e., `n == neg`), the penalty is simply `n` because the sum of the entire array is zero, and the penalty is the length of the array.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the string `s` is entirely composed of '+' or '-' characters correctly.
   - For a string with equal numbers of '+' and '-' characters, the penalty is zero, which is correctly handled by the formula.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotation suggests that the function `func_1` should be defined with parameters `t` and `test_cases`. However, this is not necessary because the function reads input directly from `input()`, which is a valid approach for handling test cases in this context.
   - The state of the program before and after the function call is correctly described.
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n` is correctly applied and explained in the annotations.

6. **Verification of the Formula:**
   - Let's verify the formula with the provided examples:
     - For `s = "+"`, `n = 1`, `neg = 0`, the penalty is `1 - 2 * 0 = 1`.
     - For `s = "-----"`, `n = 5`, `neg = 5`, the penalty is `5 - 2 * 5 = 5` (since `n == neg`).
     - For `s = "+-+-+-"`, `n = 6`, `neg = 3`, the penalty is `6 - 2 * 3 = 0` (since `n == 2 * neg`).
     - For `s = "--+++++++-"`, `n = 10`, `neg = 2`, the penalty is `10 - 2 * 2 = 6` (but the correct answer is 4, so this needs further analysis).
     - For `s = "+---++++-+++++---++-"`, `n = 20`, `neg = 10`, the penalty is `20 - 2 * 10 = 0` (but the correct answer is 4, so this needs further analysis).

   - The formula `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n` is not entirely correct. It fails to account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. The correct approach should be to split the array such that the sum of each subarray is zero whenever possible, and then calculate the penalty for the remaining subarrays.

### Correct Formula:
- The correct formula should be:
  - If `n == 2 * neg` (i.e., the number of '+' and '-' characters is equal), the penalty is `0`.
  - Otherwise, the penalty is `2 * min(neg, n - neg)`, which ensures that the sum of each subarray is zero as much as possible, and the remaining subarrays are penalized minimally.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
    print(2 * min(neg, n - neg))
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was **inaccurate** because the penalty calculation formula was incorrect. The corrected formula `2 * min(neg, n - neg)` ensures the optimal split and minimizes the penalty correctly.

Final: **False**
