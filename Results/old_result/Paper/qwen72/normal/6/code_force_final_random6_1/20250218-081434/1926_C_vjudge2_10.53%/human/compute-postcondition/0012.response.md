The code snippet initializes a list `values` with zeros, where the length of the list is `max(numbers) + 1`. The list `values` will have indices ranging from 0 to `max(numbers)`, inclusive. The values in `numbers` are integers between 1 and 200,000, and `t` is the number of elements in `numbers`, which is at least 0.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` input integers, each integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized with zeros.**
