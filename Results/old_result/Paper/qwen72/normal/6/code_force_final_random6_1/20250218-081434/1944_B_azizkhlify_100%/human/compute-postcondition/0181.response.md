To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is the first element in `res`.
   - `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` is 0 if `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2 for any `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, and each other element at index `a[j] - 1` is the count of occurrences of `a[j]` in the list `a`.
   - `r` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` for `j` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` is incremented by 1.
   - `res` is a non-empty list containing the elements from `a` that had a count of 1 in `l` up to the point where `re` equals `k` (if the loop did not break early).
   - `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` that had a count of 2 in `l` before the loop started.
   - `ur` is 0.
   - `re` is the number of elements appended to `res` (which is equal to `k` if the loop did not break early).
   - `k` is `2 * k - ul` and the current value of `k` is non-zero. If `k` is zero, the state of `res`, `re`, and `k` remains unchanged.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `i` is the first element in `res`.
   - `res` contains elements from `a` that had a count of 1 in `l`.
   - `k` is a value that is adjusted based on `ul` and is non-zero.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the first element of `res` followed by a space.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the first element of `res` is an element from `a` that had a count of 1 in `l`. Since `res` is non-empty and contains elements that meet this condition, `i` is the first such element.

Output: **[i] (where i is the first element of the list res, which contains elements from a that had a count of 1 in l)**
