Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is now `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi` and `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `mi` is the minimum value between the original `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `a[l]` is 0, `l` is now 1 and `ans` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `l` remains 0 and `ans` is 0 or 1.***
