Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of a corner of the square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and there is exactly one square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area for each test case. The number of test cases, t, is an input integer between 1 and 100.
Code of the loop:
for steps in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    c, d = map(int, input().split())
    e, f = map(int, input().split())
    g, h = map(int, input().split())
    n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
    x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
    if x > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        print(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `steps` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are input integers, `n` is equal to \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\), `x` is equal to \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\). If `x` > `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, `steps` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are input integers, `n` is equal to \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\), and `x` is now equal to \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\). If `x` > `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 100, `steps` is 2, `a` and `b` are input integers, `c` and `d` are new input integers, `e` and `f` are new input integers, `g` and `h` are new input integers, `n` is now equal to \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\), and `x` is now equal to \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\). If `x` > `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
