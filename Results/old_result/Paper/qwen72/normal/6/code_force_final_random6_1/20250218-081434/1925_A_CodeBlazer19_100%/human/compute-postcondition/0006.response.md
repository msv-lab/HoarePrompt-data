Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it is a precondition).
   - `i` is 1 (though `i` is not used in the print statement, it is a precondition).
   - `n` and `k` are input integers.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` is the alphabet in lowercase.
   - The slice `[:k]` takes the first `k` characters from this string.
   - The `* n` operation repeats the resulting string `n` times.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - The output will be the first `k` characters of the alphabet repeated `n` times.
   - Since `k` and `n` are input integers, their exact values are not known, but the output will be a string formed by repeating the first `k` characters of the alphabet `n` times.

5. **Final Output**:
   Output: **'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n (where k is the number of characters to take from the alphabet string and n is the number of times to repeat the resulting string)**
