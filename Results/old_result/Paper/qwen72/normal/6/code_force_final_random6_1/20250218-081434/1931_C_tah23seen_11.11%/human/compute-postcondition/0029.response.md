Output State: **`arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and `i` is increased by the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the initial `i`.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. Each time the loop runs, `i` is incremented by 1. The loop stops when `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be at the position where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and `i` will have been incremented by the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the initial `i`. The values of `j` and the length of `arr` remain unchanged.
