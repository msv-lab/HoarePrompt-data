The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in `s`, so the state of `i` changes to the next character in `s` at the start of each iteration. The length of `s` and the characters it contains do not change, but the position of `i` within `s` does.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is the second character of `s`.
- `s` is an input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be the third character of `s`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the third character of `s`. If `i` is in `us` and `len(win) == k`, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the first and second characters of `s`, and `ps` is 2. If `i` is in `us` and `len(win) != k`, `win` is a set containing the first and second characters of `s`, `ans` is a list containing the first character of `s`, and `ps` is 1. If `i` is not in `us`, the state of `win`, `ans`, and `ps` remains unchanged.**
