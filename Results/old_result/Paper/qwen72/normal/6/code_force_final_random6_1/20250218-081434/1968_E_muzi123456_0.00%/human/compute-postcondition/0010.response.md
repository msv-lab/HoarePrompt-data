The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is 3**
