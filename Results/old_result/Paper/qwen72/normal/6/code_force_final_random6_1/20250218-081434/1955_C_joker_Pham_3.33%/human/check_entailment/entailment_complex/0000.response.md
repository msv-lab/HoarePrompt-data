### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a`.
   - The function `func_1` is called with these inputs.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the list `a`, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of ships that have sunk.
   - The main loop runs as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - **Case 1: `l == r`**:
     - If there is only one ship left, the Kraken will attack it if `k` is greater than or equal to its durability. If the ship sinks, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and the loop breaks.
   - **Case 2: `a[l] <= a[r]`**:
     - If the durability of the first ship is less than or equal to the last ship, the Kraken will attack the first ship first.
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to twice the durability of the first ship, the Kraken can sink the first ship and reduce the durability of the last ship. The number of attacks `k` is reduced by `2 * a[l]`, and the loop continues.
     - If `k` is exactly one less than twice the durability of the first ship, the Kraken can sink the first ship with the remaining attacks, and the loop breaks.
     - If `k` is less than twice the durability of the first ship, the loop breaks.
   - **Case 3: `a[r] < a[l]`**:
     - If the durability of the last ship is less than the first ship, the Kraken will attack the last ship first.
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to twice the durability of the last ship, the Kraken can sink the last ship and reduce the durability of the first ship. The number of attacks `k` is reduced by `2 * a[r]`, and the loop continues.
     - If `k` is exactly one less than twice the durability of the last ship, the Kraken can sink the last ship with the remaining attacks, and the loop breaks.
     - If `k` is less than twice the durability of the last ship, the loop breaks.

4. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `l` is greater than `r`, meaning all ships have been processed.
   - The function returns the total number of ships that have sunk.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 0 correctly by breaking out of the loop.
   - It also handles the case where there is only one ship left (`l == r`) correctly by checking if the remaining attacks can sink the ship.

### Correctness:
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all the given edge cases. The logic for reducing the durability of the ships and counting the number of sunk ships is sound and matches the expected behavior.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
