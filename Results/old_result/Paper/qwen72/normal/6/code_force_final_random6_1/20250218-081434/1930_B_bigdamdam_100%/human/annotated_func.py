#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve the problem described, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. For the problem to be correctly addressed, the function should accept an integer `n` as a parameter, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `n` is the length of the permutation to be generated.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        
        p = [0] * n
        
        ind = n
        
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is the last value of the range `n-1`, `p` is a list of `n` elements where the even-indexed elements (starting from index 0) are filled with values in descending order starting from `n` and decreasing by 2, and the odd-indexed elements are filled with values starting from `1 + n % 2` and increasing by 2. The variable `ind` is `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (n // 2)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer from the user input, which determines the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and generates a permutation of length `n`. The permutation is constructed such that the even-indexed elements (starting from index 0) are filled with values in descending order starting from `n` and decreasing by 2, and the odd-indexed elements are filled with values starting from `1 + n % 2` and increasing by 2. The function prints the generated permutation for each test case. After the function concludes, the input variables remain unchanged, and the permutations are printed to the console.
