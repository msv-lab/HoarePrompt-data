Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque containing `n-2` positive integers where 1 <= `nums[i]` <= 10^9, `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element that was removed from the left of `nums`, `b` is the last element that was removed from the right of `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `k` is less than 2 * `x`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
