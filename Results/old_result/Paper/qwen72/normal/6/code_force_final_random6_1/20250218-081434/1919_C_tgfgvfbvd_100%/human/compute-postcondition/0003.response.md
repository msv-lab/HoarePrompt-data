Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is now `float('inf')`, `b` is now `float('inf')`.**

In natural language: The variables `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged. The variable `a` is now `float('inf')`, and a new variable `b` is also set to `float('inf')`. Both `a` and `b` are now set to the value representing positive infinity in Python.
