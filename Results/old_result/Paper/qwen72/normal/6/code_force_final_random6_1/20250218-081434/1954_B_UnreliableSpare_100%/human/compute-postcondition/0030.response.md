Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is `arr[0]`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity'). Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`.***
