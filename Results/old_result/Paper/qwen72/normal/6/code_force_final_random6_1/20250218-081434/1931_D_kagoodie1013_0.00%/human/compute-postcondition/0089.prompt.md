Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `count` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in arr:
    mod_x = -num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
    mod_x_key = num % x
    mod_y_key = num % y
    mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
    mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `count` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `mod_y_map` now contains the key `mod_y_key` with the value 1, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is equal to `num % y` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_x_map` now contains the key `mod_x_key` with the value 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `count` is now equal to the sum of the values of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `mod_y_map` now contains the key `mod_y_key` with the value 2, `mod_x` is equal to `-num % x` for the first element of `arr`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` for the second element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is equal to `num % x` for the second element of `arr`, `mod_y_key` is now equal to `num % y` for the second element of `arr`, `mod_x_map` now contains the key `mod_x_key` with the value `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `mod_x_map` now contains the key `mod_x_key` with the value `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1`. `mod_y_map` contains the key `mod_y_key` with the value 3. All other initial conditions remain unchanged: `mod_x_key` is still equal to `num % x` for the third element of `arr`; `count` is still equal to the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)`, `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, and the previous value of `count`; `test_cases` is still a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples; `(n, x, y, arr)` is still the third tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` must still have at least `n` elements; `num` is still the third element of `arr`; `results` is still a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it; `mod_x` is still equal to `-num % x` for the third element of `arr`; `mod_y` is still equal to `num % y` for the third element of `arr`; `mod_y_key` is still equal to `num % y` for the third element of `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
