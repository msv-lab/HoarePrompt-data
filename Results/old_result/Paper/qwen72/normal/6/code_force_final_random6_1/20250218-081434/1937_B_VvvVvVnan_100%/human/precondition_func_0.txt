The function `func_1` is expected to take input through a predefined method or global variables, as the function definition does not specify any parameters. The input should consist of multiple test cases, each containing an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and two binary strings of length n, representing the two rows of a 2 × n grid. The function should output the lexicographically smallest string attainable by a path from the top-left to the bottom-right cell and the number of such paths for each test case.
