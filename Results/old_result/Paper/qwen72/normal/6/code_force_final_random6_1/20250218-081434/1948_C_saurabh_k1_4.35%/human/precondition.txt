t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The grid is represented by two strings of length n, each containing only the characters '<' and '>', indicating the direction of the arrows in the first and second rows, respectively.
