The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `ans_f`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `ans_f`. If `ans_f` has at least three elements, the loop will execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `ans_f` must contain at least two elements, and `i` is the second element of `ans_f`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ans_f` must have at least three elements, and `i` will be the third element of `ans_f`.

State: **`t` is 0, `i` is the third element of `ans_f`, `ans_f` must contain at least three elements**
