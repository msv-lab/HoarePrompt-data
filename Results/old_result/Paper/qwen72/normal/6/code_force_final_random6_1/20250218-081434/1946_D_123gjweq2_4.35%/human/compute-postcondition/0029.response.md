Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`.**

Explanation:
- `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers.
- `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not equal to -1.
- `new_arr` is a list containing the values of `xor` at the end of each iteration where the bit at position `bit` in `xor` was 0.
- The bit at position `bit` in `xor` is set to 1, and `thing1` is -1.
- The current value of `x` has the bit at position `bit` set to 1.
- The program returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`. Since we don't have the implementation of `find_max`, we can only describe the return value in terms of these two variables.
