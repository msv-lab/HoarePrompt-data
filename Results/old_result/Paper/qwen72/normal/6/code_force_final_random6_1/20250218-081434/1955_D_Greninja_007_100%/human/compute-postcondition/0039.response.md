The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: an integer representing the length of list `a`.
- `m`: an integer representing the length of list `b`.
- `k`: an integer representing a threshold value.
- `a`: a list of `n` integers.
- `b`: a list of `m` integers.

The function returns the number of times the sum of elements from list `a` and list `b` (denoted as `sm`) was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.

Functionality: **The function accepts integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. It returns the count of how many times the sum of elements from `a` and `b` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.**
