Postcondition: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of integers, `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing the range of an operation, and `ops` now includes an additional inner list `[r + 1, l + 1]`. The minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0.**
