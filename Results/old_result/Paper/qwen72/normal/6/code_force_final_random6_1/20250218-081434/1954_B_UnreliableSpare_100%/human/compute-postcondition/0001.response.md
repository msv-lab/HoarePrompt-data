The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `arr`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer, but the code does not directly affect `n` in this snippet. The array `a` is not yet defined, but `arr` will hold the input values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from input.**
