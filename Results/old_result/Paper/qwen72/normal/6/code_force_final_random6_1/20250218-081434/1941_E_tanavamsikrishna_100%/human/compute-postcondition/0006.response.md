To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `costs`. The loop condition is `i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1))`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= k`
- `i` is 0
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n
- `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m
- `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers
- `costs` is a list of `n` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`
- `total_costs` is a list containing one element which is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.
- The length of `costs` remains the same, and it must be at least `k` for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be 1.
- `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 1, which simplifies to `len(costs) >= k`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= k`, `i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers, `costs` is a list of `n` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`, `total_costs` is a list containing one element which is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`**
