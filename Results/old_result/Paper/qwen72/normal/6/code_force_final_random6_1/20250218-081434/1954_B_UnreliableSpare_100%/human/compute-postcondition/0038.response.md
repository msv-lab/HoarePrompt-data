Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is the minimum of `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt`, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is the length of the last consecutive sequence of `val` in `arr`.** 

This postcondition retains all the conditions stated in the precondition and adds the condition that `flag` is True, which means all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0. Additionally, since `flag` is True, `i` is `n-1` (indicating the loop completed without breaking), and `ans` is the minimum of `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt` (where `cnt` is the length of the last consecutive sequence of `val` in `arr`).
