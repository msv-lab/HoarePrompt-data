Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '1', `ans` contains all unique values of `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`. `m` must be greater than 1, `r` is the first element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space, `r` is now an integer, `temp` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ans` is a set containing at least one unique value of `(q + r) % n` or `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. `q` is an element of `ans`, `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 1, `r` is the first element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space and is now an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space, and `c` is either '0', '1', or '?'. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ans` is a set containing at least one unique value of `(q + r) % n` or `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', the value `(q - r) % n` has been added to `temp`. If `c` is neither '0' nor '?', the state of `ans` and `temp` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the value `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`. If `c` is '0', `temp` contains the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`. If `c` is neither '0' nor '?', the state of `ans` and `temp` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
