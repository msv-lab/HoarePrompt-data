Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first input string, `b` is the integer value of the second input string, and `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` is updated to `2 * b // 5` if `t` was divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is updated to `2 * b // 5 + 1`. If `t1` is less than `a`, then `t2` is equal to `a - t1`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, then `t` is updated to `2 * b // 5 + t2 // 15` if `t` was divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is updated to `2 * b // 5 + 1 + t2 // 15`. If `t2` is not divisible by 15, then `t` is updated to `2 * b // 5 + t2 // 15 + 1`.***
