Postcondition: ***`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `l` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `a[1] - 1` is 0 if `l[a[1] - 1]` was 2, and each other element at index `a[j] - 1` is the count of occurrences of `a[j]` in the list `a`, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` for `j` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` is incremented by 1, `res` is an empty list, `ul` is 4 if `l[a[0] - 1]` was 2 and `l[a[1] - 1]` was 2, otherwise `ul` is 2 if `l[a[0] - 1]` was 2, `ur` is 0, `re` is 0. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
