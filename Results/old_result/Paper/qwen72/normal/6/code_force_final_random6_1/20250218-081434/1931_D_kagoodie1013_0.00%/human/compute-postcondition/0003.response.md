Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary called `mod_x_map`. The other variables remain unchanged, so `test_cases` still contains at least one tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is still the first tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is still an empty list, and `count` is still 0.
