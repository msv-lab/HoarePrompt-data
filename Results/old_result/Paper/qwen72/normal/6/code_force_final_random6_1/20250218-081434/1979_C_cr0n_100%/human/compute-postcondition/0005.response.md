The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `vals`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `vals`. If `vals` has more elements, the loop will execute again with the next element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` was the first element of `vals`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be the next element in the list, which is the second element of `vals`.

State: **N is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers where each element is a multiplier (k_i) for the i-th outcome, such that 1 <= N <= 50 and 2 <= vals[i] <= 20 for all 0 <= i < N, `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)`, `x` is the second element of `vals`.**
