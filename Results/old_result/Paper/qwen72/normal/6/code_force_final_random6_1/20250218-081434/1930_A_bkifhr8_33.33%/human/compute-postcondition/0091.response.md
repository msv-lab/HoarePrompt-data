The value of `ans` is appended to the list `ans_f`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 2n + 1, `i` is 2n, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ans_f` contains the value of `ans` before the if-else block and the new value of `ans`, `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of pairs of integers from `lst` until `lst` has 2 or fewer elements, and `lst` is either an empty list or a list with 2 elements.
