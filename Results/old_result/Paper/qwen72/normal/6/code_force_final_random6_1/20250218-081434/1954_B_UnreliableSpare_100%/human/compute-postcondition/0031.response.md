To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from input.
- `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise `flag` is False.
- `val` is `arr[0]`.
- If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity').
- Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **State of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
3. **State of `n`**: `n` must remain greater than `i` for the loop to execute again. Since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` are equal to the element at index 0, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 2 if `arr[1]` is equal to `val`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity') if `arr[1]` is equal to `val`, otherwise `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`.**
