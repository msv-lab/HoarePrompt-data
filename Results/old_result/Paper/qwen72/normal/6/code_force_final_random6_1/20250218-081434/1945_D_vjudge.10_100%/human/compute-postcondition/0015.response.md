Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `pergunta` is the minimum value between the original `perguna` and the sum of `x` and `a[i]` for all `i` where `i < m`.
2. `x` is the sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`.
3. `i` is `-1`.
4. `a` and `b` are lists of `n` integers.
5. `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000).
6. `m` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `x`:**
   - `x` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for all indices from `n-1` to `0`.
   - Mathematically, this can be written as:
     \[
     x = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \min(a[i], b[i])
     \]

2. **Determine `pergunta`:**
   - `pergunta` is defined as the minimum value between the original `perguna` and the sum of `x` and `a[i]` for all `i` where `i < m`.
   - Since `i` is `-1`, the condition `i < m` is always true (because `-1` is less than any positive integer `m`).
   - Therefore, `pergunta` is the minimum value between the original `perguna` and `x + a[-1]`.
   - However, `a[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `a`.

3. **Final Value of `pergunta`:**
   - The final value of `pergunta` is:
     \[
     \text{pergunta} = \min(\text{perguna}, x + a[-1])
     \]
   - Here, `perguna` is the original value of `pergunta` (which is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we will refer to it as `perguna`).

### Output:
The code will print the value of `pergunta`, which is the minimum value between the original `perguna` and the sum of `x` and the last element of the list `a`.

Output: **min(perguna, x + a[-1]) (where perguna is the original value of pergunta, x is the sum of min(a[i], b[i]) for all i from 0 to n-1, and a[-1] is the last element of the list a)**
