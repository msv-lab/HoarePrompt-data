The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment, we only need to consider `t`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, and the function `func_1` has been called. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. After each iteration, the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1, but since `_` is a placeholder and not used, we don't need to adjust it. However, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are still iterations left, which means `t` must still be greater than 0.

Since the loop has already executed once, the number of remaining iterations is `t - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment, and the function `func_1` has been called.**
