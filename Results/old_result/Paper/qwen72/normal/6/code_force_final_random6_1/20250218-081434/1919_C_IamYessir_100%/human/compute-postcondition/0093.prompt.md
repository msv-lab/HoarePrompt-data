Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0. If `b` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is set to the last element of `a`, and `y` is set to infinity. If `b` is a non-empty list, `x` is set to infinity if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is set to the last element of `a`, and `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x` > `y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `b` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `y` is the last element of `b`, and `y` is greater than or equal to the value of `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` is a list containing `lit[0]`, `y` is the last element of `b`, and `lit[0]` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, if `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` now contains the first element of `lit`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x` and not greater than `y`, the values of `x`, `y`, and `lit` remain unchanged. If `x` ≤ `y`, and `x` == `y`, `a` contains the value of `lit[0]` as its last element, and `x` is set to `lit[0]`. If `x` < `y` and `lit[0]` is greater than or equal to `x` and less than or equal to `y`, `a` contains the value of `lit[0]` as its last element, and `x` is set to `lit[0]`. If `lit[0]` is greater than `y`, `a` now contains the value of `lit[0]` as its last element, and `x` is set to `lit[0]`. If `lit[0]` is less than `x`, the values of `x`, `y`, and `b` remain unchanged, and `x` is less than `lit[0]` and `lit[0]` is less than or equal to `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1. If `x` > `y` and `lit[1]` > `y`, `b` has the second element of `lit` appended to it, and `y` is updated to the last element of `b` (which is `lit[1]`). If `x` > `y` and `lit[1]` ≤ `y`, `x` and `y` remain unchanged. If `x` ≤ `y` and `x` == `y`, `a` has the second element of `lit` appended to it, and `x` is updated to the last element of `a` (which is `lit[1]`). If `x` < `y` and `lit[1]` > `y`, `a` has the second element of `lit` appended to it, and `x` is updated to the last element of `a` (which is `lit[1]`). If `x` < `y` and `lit[1]` ≤ `y`, `x` and `y` remain unchanged. If `a` is empty, `x` is set to infinity. If `b` is empty, `y` is set to infinity.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are lists that may have been modified based on the conditions in the loop body. If `x` > `y`, then: if `y` (the last element of `b` or infinity if `b` is empty) is greater than or equal to `lit[2]`, `y` is updated to `lit[2]` (if `b` is not empty). If `lit[2]` is greater than `x` (the last element of `a` or infinity if `a` is empty), `y` is updated to `lit[2]` (if `b` is not empty). If `lit[2]` is greater than `y` but not greater than `x`, then `lit[2]` is appended to `a`. If neither condition is met, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `x` ≤ `y`, then: if `x` == `y`, `a` is modified to include the element `lit[2]` at the end, and `x` is the last element of `a`. If `x` < `y`, then: if `x` ≥ `lit[2]`, `a` includes the element `lit[2]` at the end, and `x` is the last element of `a` (which is now `lit[2]` if `a` was not empty before). If `x` < `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` > `y`, `a` includes the element `lit[2]` at the end, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is now `lit[2]` if `a` was previously empty, or the last element of `a` before the new addition if `a` was not empty), and `y` retains its previous value. If `y` ≥ `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` > `x`, `b` includes the element `lit[2]` at the end, `x` retains its previous value, and `y` is the last element of `b` (which is now `lit[2]` if `b` was previously empty, or the last element of `b` before the new addition if `b` was not empty). Otherwise, if `x` is not less than `y`, the lists `a` and `b` and the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
