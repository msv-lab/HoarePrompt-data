Output State: **`arr` contains the indices of the bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` has a new element appended which is equal to `k0 - sum(ans)` before the execution of the code.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends a new element to the list `ans`. This new element is calculated as `k0 - sum(ans)`, where `sum(ans)` is the sum of the elements in `ans` before the execution of the code. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged.
