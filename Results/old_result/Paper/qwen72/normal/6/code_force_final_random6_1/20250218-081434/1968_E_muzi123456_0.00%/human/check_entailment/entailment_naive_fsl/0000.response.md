Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all potential cases. Specifically, the program always outputs points along the first row, which does not ensure the maximum possible number of distinct Manhattan distances for larger values of \(n\).

For example, consider \(n = 3\). The program will output:
```
1 1
1 2
1 3
```
The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{|1-1| + |1-2|, |1-1| + |1-3|, |1-1| + |2-3|\} = \{1, 2, 1\} = \{1, 2\}
\]
However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) (as shown in the problem description) is:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{|2-2| + |1-3|, |2-3| + |1-1|, |2-3| + |3-1|\} = \{2, 1, 3\}
\]
This set has 3 distinct distances, which is the maximum possible for \(n = 3\).

Therefore, the program does not always produce the correct output for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).
