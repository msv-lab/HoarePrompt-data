Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `A`, `B`, and `C` are the values input by the user, split by spaces. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, no changes are made to `A`, `B`, `C`, or `i`. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and if `A` is even, no changes are made to `A`, `B`, `C`, or `i`. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.***
