Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element. If `len(a) == 0`, `x` is infinity. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `len(b) == 0`, `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. The list `b` now contains the element `lit[2]` at its end.**

Explanation:
- The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index 2 of the list `lit` to the list `b`.
- The value of `i` is 2, so `lit[2]` is appended to `b`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `s`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.
- The length of `b` increases by 1, and the last element of `b` is now `lit[2]`.
