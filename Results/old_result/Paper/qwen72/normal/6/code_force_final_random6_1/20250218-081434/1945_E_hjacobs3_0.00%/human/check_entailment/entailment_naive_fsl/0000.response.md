Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the binary search and the required swaps to ensure the correct position of the target element `x` after the search. Specifically, the binary search logic and the swap logic are flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
1 2 4 5 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
3 5
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0
```

In this case, the permutation is `[1, 2, 4, 5, 3]` and the target element `x` is `3`. The correct position for `3` is at index `2` (0-based index), but the program incorrectly determines that no swaps are needed and returns `0`. This is because the binary search logic in `func_1` is not correctly identifying the position where `3` should be, and the swap logic is not ensuring that the element is in the correct position after the search.

The binary search should be adjusted to correctly handle the case where the target element is found, and the swap logic should ensure that the element is in the correct position after the search. The current implementation does not meet these requirements, leading to incorrect results for some cases.
