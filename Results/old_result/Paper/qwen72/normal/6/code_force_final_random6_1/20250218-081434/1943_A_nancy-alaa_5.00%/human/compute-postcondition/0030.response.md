Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is a positive integer where \( n \geq 3 \).
- `i` is 2.
- The condition states that if `i` is not a key in `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given this information, the `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is explicitly stated to be 2.

Output: **2**
