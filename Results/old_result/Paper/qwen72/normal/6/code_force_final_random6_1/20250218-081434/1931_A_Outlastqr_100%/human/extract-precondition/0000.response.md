Precondition: **The function should accept an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) as the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded word.**

However, the provided function definition does not include any parameters, which seems to be a mistake based on the problem description. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func(t, cases):
```

Where `cases` is a list of integers, each representing the encoded word for the respective test case. 

Given the original function definition, the precondition would be:

**The function should be called with a list of integers, each integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded word for a test case.**
