Postcondition: **`bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a[j]` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is increased by the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `bets - 1`, and the current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.**
