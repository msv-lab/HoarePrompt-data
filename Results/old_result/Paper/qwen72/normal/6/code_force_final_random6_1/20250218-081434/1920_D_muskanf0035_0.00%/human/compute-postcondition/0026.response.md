Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n`, a list of tuples `operations` where each tuple contains an operation type (1 or 2) and a positive integer value, and a list of positive integers `queries`. It modifies an array based on the operations specified in `operations`: appending the value if the operation type is 1, or duplicating the current elements of the array if the operation type is 2. After processing all operations, the function returns a list `result` containing the elements at the indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` of the modified array for each query index `k` in `queries`. The final state of the program includes the modified `array` and the `result` list, which contains the queried elements. **
