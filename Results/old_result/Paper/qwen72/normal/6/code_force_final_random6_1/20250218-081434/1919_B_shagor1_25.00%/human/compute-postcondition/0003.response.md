The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is not empty (i.e., it contains at least one character), the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `neg` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string. For the loop to execute, `s` must have at least one character, and `i` will be the first character of `s`.

State: **`func_1` is defined with parameters `t` and `test_cases`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least one character, `i` is the first character of `s`, `neg` is 0**
