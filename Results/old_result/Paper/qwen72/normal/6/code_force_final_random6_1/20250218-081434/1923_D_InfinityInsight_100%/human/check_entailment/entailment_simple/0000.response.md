### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of slimes `n` and the list of sizes `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is designed to find the minimum index in the list `a` where the cumulative sum of elements up to that index is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - It uses the `bisect_left` function to find the index efficiently.
   - The function correctly handles the case where `x` is less than 0 by returning -1.
   - If the element at the found index `inx` is equal to `x`, it returns `inx + 1` (since indices are 0-based, adding 1 to get 1-based index).
   - Otherwise, it returns `inx`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the minimum time for each slime to be eaten from the left.
   - It initializes `left` with a cumulative sum of the sizes of the slimes.
   - It also initializes `last` to keep track of the last occurrence of each size.
   - The function iterates through the list `a` and updates the `ans` list based on the conditions:
     - If `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, the slime at index `i` can be eaten by the slime at index `i-1` in 1 second.
     - Otherwise, it calculates `x` as the cumulative sum up to `i` minus the size of the slime at `i` minus 1.
     - It then finds the minimum index `inx` using `func_1` and the last occurrence index `inx2` from `last`.
     - If `inx2` is less than `inx`, it updates `inx` to `inx2`.
     - If `inx` is non-negative, it updates `ans[i]` to `i + 1 - inx`.

4. **Combining Results from Both Directions:**
   - The program calls `func_2` twice: once for the original list `a` and once for the reversed list `a[::-1]`.
   - It then combines the results by taking the minimum of the two values for each slime, unless one of them is -1, in which case it takes the maximum (which will be the non-negative value).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final results for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the problem by considering both left and right neighbors.
- The use of cumulative sums and the `bisect_left` function ensures efficient computation.
- The logic for updating the `ans` list based on the conditions is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
