Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string that must have at least one integer, `c` is the first integer in `s` and its current value is 0, `cnt` is [1, 0], `ans` is 0, and `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`. `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` checks if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. Since `cnt[1]` is 0, the condition `cnt[1] > 0` is false, so `ans` is not incremented and remains 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
