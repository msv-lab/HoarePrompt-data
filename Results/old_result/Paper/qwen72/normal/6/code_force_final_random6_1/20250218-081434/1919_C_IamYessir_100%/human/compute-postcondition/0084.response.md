Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list that now includes the third element of `lit` (i.e., `lit[2]`), `b` is a list that may have been modified based on the conditions in the loop body, `x` is either infinity (if `a` is empty) or the last element of `a` (which is now `lit[2]` if `a` was not empty before), and `y` is either infinity (if `b` is empty) or the last element of `b`.**
