Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t = input()
    l = t.count('L')
    k = 0
    q1 = 0
    q2 = 0
    if t[-1] == 'L':
        k = a[l - 1] % m
        q1 = l - 2
        q2 = l
    else:
        k = a[l] % m
        q1 = l - 1
        q2 = l + 1
    y = [0] * n
    y[-1] = k
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if t[i] == 'R':
            k = k * a[q2] % m
            q2 += 1
        else:
            k = k * a[q1] % m
            q1 -= 1
        y[i] = k
    print(*y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of times 'L' appears in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where the last element is `k` (which is `a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `a[l] % m`), `q1` is `l - 2 - (n - 1)` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and the number of 'R' characters in `t` is less than `n - 1`, otherwise `l - 1 - (n - 1)`, `q2` is `l + (n - 1)` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and the number of 'R' characters in `t` is less than `n - 1`, otherwise `l + 1 + (n - 1)`, `i` is -1, and `y` is fully populated with the values of `k` after each iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ii` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `t` is the input string, `l` is the number of times 'L' appears in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where each element is updated to `k` based on the loop, and `k` is the final value after all iterations, `i` is -1, `q1` is either -1 or `l - n` depending on the last character of `t`, and `q2` is either `l + n - 1` or `l + n` depending on the last character of `t`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is -1, `k` is the final value of `k` after all iterations, `q1` and `q2` are updated based on the loop conditions, and `y` is a list where each element from index 0 to `n-2` is the corresponding value of `k` after each iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
