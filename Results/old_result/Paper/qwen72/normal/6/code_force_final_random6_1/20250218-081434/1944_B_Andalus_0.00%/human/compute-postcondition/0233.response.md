The only objects in the loop head are the variables `elem` and `sng`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `sng`. If `sng` has more elements, the loop will execute again with the next element in `sng`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is unchanged, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element) and must have at least 2 elements, `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `rdb` times 2 plus 2, `_` is `T`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`, `elem` is the second element in `sng`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have at least 3 elements (since `elem` is the second element, the next iteration would use the third element). Therefore, `elem` will be the third element in `sng`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is unchanged, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are equal to their previous element, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are not equal to their previous element and not equal to their next element (if they have a next element) and must have at least 3 elements, `k` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged, `lft` is unchanged, `rgt` is unchanged, `sz` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `rdb` times 2 plus 2, `_` is `T`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element in `rgt`, `elem` is the third element in `sng`.**
