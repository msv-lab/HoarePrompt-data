Postcondition: **`j` will be equal to `n`, `i` will be 0, `idx_B` will contain the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` will contain the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty lists. `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current character at position `i` in the string `s` is '>'. Additionally, the condition `l < r` is true, meaning that `l` is less than the length of `B`. `a` is now equal to the first element of `A` (i.e., `A[0]`). `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, and `x` is greater than or equal to 0. `b` is the last element of `B`.**
