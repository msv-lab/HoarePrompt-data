The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` in the order they appear, separated by spaces. After printing the elements, it prints a blank line. The function does not modify the list `l` and does not return any value.
