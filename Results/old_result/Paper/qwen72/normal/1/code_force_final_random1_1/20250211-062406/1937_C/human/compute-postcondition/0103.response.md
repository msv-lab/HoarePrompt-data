Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `best` is `n-1`, `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 1 if no such `i` exists, `res` is '<'.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `best`. Since `i` is initially set to `n-1`, `best` now holds the value `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
