Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`, and `mex` is now equal to `n - sum(ar)`. The variable `i` is `-1` after the loop has completed all its iterations.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to an integer provided by the user input.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `ar`, `res`, `mex`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer, which is now updated by the user input.
- The rest of the initial state remains valid and unchanged.
