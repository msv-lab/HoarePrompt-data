The function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` is called, which suggests a recursive process. However, without the definition of `recursive_maximize_sum`, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables. We can only infer that the function is called with `l` and `pos - 1` as arguments.

Given the initial state:
- `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq l \leq r < \text{len}(a)\)
- `a` is a list of integers
- `s` is the sum of elements in `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive, and `s` is greater than \((r - l + 1) \times (r - l + 1)\)
- `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`
- `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`, and `pos` is not equal to `l`

The call to `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` does not change the values of `l`, `r`, `a`, `s`, `mx`, or `pos` directly. However, it initiates a recursive process that might affect these variables in subsequent calls.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq l \leq r < \text{len}(a)\), `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of elements in `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive, and `s` is greater than \((r - l + 1) \times (r - l + 1)\), `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`, and `pos` is not equal to `l`. The function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called.**
