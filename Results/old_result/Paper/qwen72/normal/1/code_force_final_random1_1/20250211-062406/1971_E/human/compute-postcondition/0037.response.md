The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end prematurely and moves the control back to the beginning of the loop for the next iteration. This means that no changes are made to the variables during the current iteration, and the loop continues with the next iteration.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers provided by the user input where `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations plus 1, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user from the second input, `ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b` for all elements in `b` except the last one, `i` is 1, `len(b)` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, `v` is a list containing 0 followed by the values `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., up to `ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]`, `l` is 0, `m` is 0, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than `ql`, and the element `a[s]` is equal to `ql`. The loop continues to the next iteration.**
