Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program has a logical error in the condition `if B * 2 < C:`. This condition checks if the price of two individual yogurts is less than the promotional price for two yogurts. However, this logic is flawed because it doesn't consider the optimal way to purchase yogurts when the promotional price is better.

The correct approach should be to always use the promotional price for pairs of yogurts and then use the individual price for any remaining yogurts. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost using the promotional price for pairs and individual price for the remainder
        cost = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        print(cost)
```

This corrected version ensures that the minimum cost is calculated correctly by maximizing the use of the promotional price and then adding the cost of any remaining yogurts at the individual price.
