Output State: **`t` is an integer where 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 + 1, `n` is the first input integer greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer greater than 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 4 to 5.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `newk`, `a`, `b`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes`) remain unchanged.
