Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1, `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())`, `l` is a list of integers derived from `input().split()`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `l`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The new list `l` contains the integers from the input.
