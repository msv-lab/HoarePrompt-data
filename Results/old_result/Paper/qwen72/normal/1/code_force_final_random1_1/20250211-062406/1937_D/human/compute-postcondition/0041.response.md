The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `j`.

Given that `j` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, incrementing `j` by 1 makes `j` equal to 1. Since `n` is greater than 0, it must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 1`. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`, `idx_B` is a list containing `[i]`. If `idx_B` was initially empty, `B` is a list containing `[0]`. Otherwise, if `idx_B` is not empty, `x` is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1)) * len(idx_B)`, and `B` is a list with one additional element `x` appended to it. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is not `<`, there are no changes to `idx_B` or `B`.**
