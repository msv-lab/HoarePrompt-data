The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop's continuation is solely dependent on the value of `m`. Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `m` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` will increment by 1, and `m` must still be greater than 0.

State: **_ is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 â‰¤ 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.**
