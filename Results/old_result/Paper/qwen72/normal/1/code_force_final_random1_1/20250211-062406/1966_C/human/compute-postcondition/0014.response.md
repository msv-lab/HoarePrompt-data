Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `dp` will be `False` if there exists any pair of consecutive elements in `arr` such that the difference between them is 1 or less. Otherwise, `dp` will be `True`.
- The value of `i` will be `len(arr) - 1`.
- The variables `tc`, `n`, and `arr` will remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice' if dp else 'Alice')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement uses a conditional expression: `'Alice' if dp else 'Alice'`.
- This means that regardless of the value of `dp` (whether it is `True` or `False`), the string `'Alice'` will be printed.

### Explanation:
- If `dp` is `True`, the expression evaluates to `'Alice'`.
- If `dp` is `False`, the expression still evaluates to `'Alice'`.

Therefore, the output will always be `'Alice'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Alice**
