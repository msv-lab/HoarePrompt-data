You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    4
    
    2 3 3 1
    
    5
    
    2 2 3 2 2
    
    2
    
    10 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    2
    4
    5
    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of books. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the number of pages in each book.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of books and a list of integers representing the number of pages in each book. It then calculates and prints the sum of the maximum number of pages among all but the last book and the number of pages in the last book. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - Each test case consists of:
     - An integer `n` (number of books).
     - A list of `n` integers representing the number of pages in each book.

2. **Task:**
   - Divide the books into two non-empty piles.
   - Alice reads the book with the highest number of pages in each pile.
   - Output the maximum total number of pages Alice can read.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of page counts `nums`.

2. **Logic for Maximum Pages:**
   - The program uses `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]` to calculate the maximum number of pages Alice can read.
   - This logic assumes that the last book (`nums[-1]`) is always part of one pile, and the maximum of the remaining books (`nums[:-1]`) is part of the other pile.

3. **Correctness of Logic:**
   - The key insight here is that to maximize the total number of pages Alice reads, she should read the two largest books.
   - The provided logic does not always ensure this. For example, consider the input:
     ```
     4
     2 3 3 1
     ```
     - The program will output `3 + 1 = 4`, but the correct answer should be `3 + 3 = 6` by placing the two largest books in different piles.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not always produce the correct result because it does not consider the two largest books in the list. Instead, it always takes the last book and the maximum of the rest, which can lead to suboptimal results.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
