### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` and the list of message times `arr`.

2. **Logic for Determining Feasibility:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `array2` to store the charge consumption for intervals where the phone should remain on.
   - It iterates through the message times and checks if the interval between consecutive messages is less than `b / a`. If so, it calculates the charge consumption for that interval and appends it to `array2`.
   - The total charge consumption is calculated as the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the charge consumed by turning the phone on and off for the remaining intervals (`(n - len(array2)) * b`).
   - If the total charge consumption is less than the initial charge `f`, the program prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when there is only one message (`n == 1`), where no intervals need to be considered.
   - It also handles large inputs within the constraints provided.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program uses floating-point division `b / a` to compare intervals. This could potentially introduce precision issues, but given the constraints and the nature of the problem, it is unlikely to cause significant errors.
   - The program correctly handles the sum of `array2` and the multiplication of `(n - len(array2)) * b` to ensure the total charge consumption is accurately calculated.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the given constraints and examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
