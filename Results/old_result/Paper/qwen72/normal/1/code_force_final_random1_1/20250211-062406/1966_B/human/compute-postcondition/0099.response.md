Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input (greater than 1), `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is a user's input), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, `ans` is determined based on conditions involving `gr` and `impossible`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`tc`**: Remains 2 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains the first integer from the input (greater than 1) as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`m`**: Remains the second integer from the input as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`gr`**: After the loop completes, `gr` will contain `n` elements, each of which is a string input by the user during each iteration of the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from 0 to `n-1`.
- **`j`**: Remains `m-2` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` is determined based on the conditions involving `gr` and `impossible`. Specifically, if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, then `ans` is 'NO' if `impossible` is `True`, or 'YES' if any pair of adjacent characters in the first string or the last string of `gr` are different, or if any pair of adjacent strings in `gr` have different first or last characters. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES' and `impossible` remains `False`.
