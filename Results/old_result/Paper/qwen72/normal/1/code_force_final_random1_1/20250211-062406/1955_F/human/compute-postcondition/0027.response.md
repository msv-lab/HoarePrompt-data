To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `p_i` are integers such that \(0 \leq p_i \leq 200\).
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `cnt` is initially defined as `cnt + sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a)`.
   - `x` is the last element of `a`.

2. **Understanding `cnt`:**
   - The expression `sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a)` calculates the sum of the floor division of each element in the list `a` by 2.
   - This sum is then added to the initial value of `cnt`.

3. **Final Value of `cnt`:**
   - Since the initial value of `cnt` is not explicitly given, we assume it starts from 0 (if not specified otherwise).
   - Therefore, `cnt` will be the sum of the floor division of each element in the list `a` by 2.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(cnt)` statement will print the value of `cnt`, which is the sum of the floor division of each element in the list `a` by 2.

Given the initial state and the operations, the output will be the sum of the floor division of each element in the list `a` by 2.

Output: **sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a) (where a is the list of integers)**
