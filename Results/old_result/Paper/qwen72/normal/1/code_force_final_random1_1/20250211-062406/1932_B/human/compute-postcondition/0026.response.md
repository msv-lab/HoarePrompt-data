The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, it is `t - 1`), `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input with `len(a)` elements, `year` is the sum of each element `ai` in the list `a` where `ai` is the current element being processed in the loop, and `ai` is the last element of the list `a`.**
