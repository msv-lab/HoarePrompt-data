Output State: **`pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is 0, `best` is the minimum value between the initial `best` and the sum of `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each iteration where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `v` is 0, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` is decreased by 1, and `pos_final` are updated with the values from `input().split()`**. 

Explanation: The variable `total` is reset to 0. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged from the initial state.
