The only objects in the loop head are the variables `(l, r)` and the list `ops`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ops`. If `ops` has more tuples, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ops` must be a non-empty list of tuples, and `(l, r)` is the next tuple in `ops`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ops` must still be a non-empty list of tuples, and `(l, r)` will be the next tuple in `ops`.

State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, and `ops` must be a non-empty list of tuples, `(l, r)` is the next tuple in `ops`**
