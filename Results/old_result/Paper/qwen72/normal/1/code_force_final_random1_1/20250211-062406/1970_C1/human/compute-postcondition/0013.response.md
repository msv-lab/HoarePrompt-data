Output State: **`rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists where the list at key `a` includes `b` as its last element twice, and the list at key `b` includes `a` as its last element three times; `x` is greater than 2; `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`); `a` is the first integer from the new input; `b` is the second integer from the new input.**

Explanation:
- The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the new input and assigns them to `a` and `b`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are already defined as the first and second integers from the new input, respectively. Therefore, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the new input values.
- All other variables (`rev`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values.
- The output state reflects the updated values of `a` and `b` while keeping the rest of the initial state intact.
