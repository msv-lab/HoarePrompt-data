### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum cost to travel between two cities, where the cost can be either 1 coin to move to the closest city or the absolute difference in positions to move to any other city.
   - The closest city for each city is unique and determined by the smallest distance to another city.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, to store the cumulative minimum costs to travel from the start to the end and from the end to the start, respectively.
   - `d1` is built from left to right, and `d2` is built from right to left.

3. **Building `d1`:**
   - `d1[2] = 1` initializes the cost to move from the second city to the first city.
   - For each city `i` from 1 to `n-1`:
     - If the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city, update `d1[i + 2]` to be 1 more than `d1[i + 1]`.
     - Otherwise, update `d1[i + 2]` to be the distance to the next city plus `d1[i + 1]`.

4. **Building `d2`:**
   - `d2[n - 1] = 1` initializes the cost to move from the last city to the second-to-last city.
   - For each city `i` from `n-2` to 1:
     - If the distance to the previous city is less than the distance to the next city, update `d2[i]` to be 1 more than `d2[i + 1]`.
     - Otherwise, update `d2[i]` to be the distance to the previous city plus `d2[i + 1]`.

5. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query `(x, y)`:
     - If `y > x`, the cost is `d1[y] - d1[x]`.
     - If `y < x`, the cost is `d2[y] - d2[x]`.

6. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles multiple test cases.
   - The input constraints are respected, and the program should work within the given limits.

### Evaluation of the Program:

- **Initialization and Loop Logic:**
  - The initialization of `d1` and `d2` is correct.
  - The loops for building `d1` and `d2` correctly compute the cumulative minimum costs based on the conditions provided.

- **Query Handling:**
  - The program correctly handles the queries by checking the direction of travel and using the appropriate dictionary (`d1` or `d2`) to compute the minimum cost.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles edge cases such as the first and last cities, ensuring that the closest city is always considered.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to travel between two cities using the given rules. The approach of building `d1` and `d2` ensures that the minimum cost is calculated efficiently for each query.

Final: **True**
