The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` from the user input, where `2 <= n <= 10^4`. It then performs a series of operations using helper functions `func_1` and `func_2`. If `n` is 2, it calls `func_2(0, 1)` and returns immediately. Otherwise, it determines the maximum and minimum indices based on the results of `func_1` comparisons. Finally, it calls `func_2` with the determined maximum and minimum indices. The function does not return any value.
