### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `n`.

2. **Initialization**: The variable `ans` is initialized to 1, which is the smallest possible GCD. This is a good starting point because the GCD cannot be less than 1.

3. **Loop through Divisors**: The function iterates through potential divisors `i` from 1 to the square root of `x`. This is efficient because any divisor larger than the square root would have a corresponding divisor smaller than the square root.

4. **Conditions for Valid Divisors**:
   - The first condition checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` (`x % i == 0`).
   - The second condition checks if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i` (`x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`). This ensures that the sum of the sub-problems' difficulties is `x` and that the GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties is `i`.
   - The third condition checks if `x // i` is a valid divisor and if `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `x // i` (`x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`). This is similar to the first condition but considers the other factor of `x`.

5. **Update Maximum GCD**: The function updates `ans` to the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` that satisfies the conditions. This ensures that the maximum possible GCD is found.

6. **Output**: The function prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which is the maximum balance that can be achieved.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problem set by considering all valid divisors of `x` and ensuring that the sum of the sub-problems' difficulties is `x`. The conditions and logic are sound and cover all necessary cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
