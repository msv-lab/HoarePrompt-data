Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` (n) satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`. The frequency of the integer 0 in `nums` is decreased by 1, and the frequency of the integer 1 in `nums` is now the original frequency minus 2. If `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is true (i.e., the frequency of `start + 1` is greater than 0), then the frequency of the integer 2 in `nums` is now the original frequency minus 1, `start` is 2, and `vis` is a set containing the elements 0 and 1. If `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is false, the program does not return any value.***
