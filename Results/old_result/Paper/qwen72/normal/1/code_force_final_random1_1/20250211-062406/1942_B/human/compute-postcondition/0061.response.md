The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition but operates under the context of processing multiple test cases. For each test case, it implicitly processes an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` (where `a` is derived from the MEX operation on a permutation `p`). The function returns the permutation `p` for each test case, which is a list of integers that satisfies the conditions described by the MEX operation and the constraints provided.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. It returns the permutation `p` for each test case, ensuring that `p` satisfies the conditions derived from the MEX operation on `a`.**
