Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is equal to `t` and greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
- `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1.
- `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, and `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(d2[y] - d2[x])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Defaultdict Initialization**:
   - `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, and `d1[2]` is explicitly set to 1.
   - `d2` is also a defaultdict with default factory `int`, and `d2[n - 1]` is explicitly set to 1.

2. **Values of `d2`**:
   - Since `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, any key that is not explicitly set will have a value of 0.
   - The only explicitly set key in `d2` is `n - 1`, and its value is 1.

3. **Values of `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, and `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

4. **Expression `d2[y] - d2[x]`**:
   - If `y` is equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[y]` will be 1.
   - If `x` is equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[x]` will be 1.
   - For any other values of `y` and `x` that are not equal to `n - 1`, `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` will both be 0.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: Both `y` and `x` are not equal to `n - 1`.
  - `d2[y] = 0` and `d2[x] = 0`.
  - `d2[y] - d2[x] = 0 - 0 = 0`.

- **Scenario 2**: `y` is equal to `n - 1` and `x` is not equal to `n - 1`.
  - `d2[y] = 1` and `d2[x] = 0`.
  - `d2[y] - d2[x] = 1 - 0 = 1`.

- **Scenario 3**: `y` is not equal to `n - 1` and `x` is equal to `n - 1`.
  - `d2[y] = 0` and `d2[x] = 1`.
  - `d2[y] - d2[x] = 0 - 1 = -1`.

- **Scenario 4**: Both `y` and `x` are equal to `n - 1`.
  - `d2[y] = 1` and `d2[x] = 1`.
  - `d2[y] - d2[x] = 1 - 1 = 0`.

### Conclusion:
The output will depend on the values of `y` and `x` relative to `n - 1`. However, without specific values for `y` and `x`, we can generalize the possible outputs based on the scenarios above.

Output: **0 or 1 or -1 (depending on the values of `y` and `x` relative to `n - 1`)**.
