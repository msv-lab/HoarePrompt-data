The code snippet `points[team] += 1` increments the value of `points[team]` by 1. This means the value of `points[team]` is increased by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, `points[team]` is increased by 1, `mov`, `grid`, and `player` remain unchanged, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is (`pos[0]` + `mov[com][0]`, `pos[1]` + `mov[com][1]`).**
