Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the count of '1' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, and `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where `zero * 100 // (i + 1)` and `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)` are both greater than or equal to 50.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value between 100000000 and `abs(n / 2 - ele)`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the count of '1' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, and `lst` contains at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value between 100000000 and `abs(n / 2 - ele)`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the count of '1' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` contains at least two elements, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value between 100000000 and `abs(n / 2 - ele)`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the count of '1' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` contains at least one more element, `ele` is the next element in `lst`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
