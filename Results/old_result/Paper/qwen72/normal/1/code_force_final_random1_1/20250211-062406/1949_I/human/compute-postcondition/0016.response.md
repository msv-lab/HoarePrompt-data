To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

2. **Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `i` explicitly.

3. **Adjusting `n`**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Given the initial state, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, which already satisfies this condition.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, `ok`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than 0, which is already satisfied by the given state (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000). Therefore, no additional adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`**.
