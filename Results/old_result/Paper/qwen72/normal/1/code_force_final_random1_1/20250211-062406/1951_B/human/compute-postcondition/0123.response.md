The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently executing. This does not change the values of any variables directly. However, the conditions described in the initial state about the relationships between `i`, `h`, `ans1`, and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `s`, `i` is compared to `h`, `ans1` and `z` retain their previous values, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
