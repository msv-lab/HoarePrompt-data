The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i` (so `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` is a list containing the elements [0, `suf[1]`, `suf[2]`]. Otherwise, `smin` is a list containing the elements [0, 0, `suf[2]`].**
