Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `word` is an empty string initially. If `n` > 52, `word` is the string containing the character from `alphabet[n - 53]` followed by `'zz'`. If `n` is between 27 and 52 (inclusive), `word` is set to `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. If `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), `word` is set to `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.***
