To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given program state and the `while` loop condition:

- **Program State**: 
  - `i` is 0
  - `n_cases` must be greater than 0
  - `n` is log2 of the input integer
  - `power` is 1

- **Loop Condition**: `while power < n:`

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `power < n` must be true. Let's break this down:

1. **Current Values**:
   - `power` is 1
   - `n` is log2 of the input integer

2. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop will execute if `1 < n`.
   - For `1 < n` to be true, `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `n` is log2 of the input integer, `n` will be greater than 1 if the input integer is greater than 2 (because log2(2) = 1).
   - Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `power` since it is already 1.
   - We need to ensure that the input integer is greater than 2 to make `n` greater than 1.

Given that `n_cases` must be greater than 0 and this does not directly affect the loop condition, we do not need to adjust it.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input integer is greater than 2, which will make `n` greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` is log2 of the input integer (input integer must be greater than 2), `power` is 1**
