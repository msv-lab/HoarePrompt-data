Output State: **All elements in `b_values` have been processed, `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for every `i` in `b_values` except for each `cnt_b[b[j]]` where `j` ranges from 0 to `m-1`, which are incremented by 1. `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `i` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 0. `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`. `ans` is 0. `curr` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `curr` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables or conditions in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the information from the initial state, with the addition that `curr` is now 0.
