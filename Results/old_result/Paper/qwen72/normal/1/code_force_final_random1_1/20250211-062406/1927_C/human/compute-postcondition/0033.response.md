Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2, and the conditions for `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain as described in the initial state. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
