Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
- The function `func_2` calls `recursive_maximize_sum` but does not pass the `ops` list, which is required for storing the operations. This will lead to an error because `recursive_maximize_sum` and `func_1` both attempt to append to `ops`, which is not defined within their scope.
- The condition in `func_1` where it checks `if a[l] != r - l + 1:` is incorrect. The MEX value should be determined by the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not necessarily `r - l + 1`.
- The logic in `recursive_maximize_sum` for determining whether to apply the operation is flawed. The condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):` does not correctly reflect the criteria for applying the MEX operation.
- The function `func_3` reads input and prints output, but it does not handle the constraints and edge cases properly, and it relies on the correctness of the other functions, which have issues as mentioned above.

These issues indicate that the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
