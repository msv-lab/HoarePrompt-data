The value of `y` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. The condition for updating `cnt` (`math.gcd(x, y) == 1`) might now be different due to the increment of `y`, but since the code snippet only increments `y` and does not re-evaluate the condition, `cnt` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 6, `x` remains unchanged, `y` is incremented by 1, `cnt` remains unchanged.**
