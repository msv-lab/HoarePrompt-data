Output State: **`lst` is an empty list, `ele` is the last element in the original `lst`, `mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in the original `lst`, `final` contains all elements from the original `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`, sorted in ascending order. If `len(final) == 0`, `final` now includes either 0 or `n` depending on whether `c1` is greater than or equal to 50 or less than 50, respectively, and the length of `final` is 1. The loop will execute one more time if `t` is greater than 0. `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`. `zero` is 0, `one` is 0.**
