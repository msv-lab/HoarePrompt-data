Output State: **`numTest` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 3, `a[0]` is 0, `a[1]` is 0, `a[2]` is 0, `a[3]` is unchanged, `i` is 2, `opNum` is 0, `stop` is False, `a[4]` is unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[i + 2] -= opNum` is executed.
- `i` is 2, so `i + 2` is 4.
- `opNum` is 0, so `a[4] -= 0` does not change the value of `a[4]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
