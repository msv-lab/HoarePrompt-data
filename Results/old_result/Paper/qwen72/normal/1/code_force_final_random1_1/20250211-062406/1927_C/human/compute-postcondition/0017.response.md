Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `aOnes` is 1, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `i` is in `a`, and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `aOnes` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
