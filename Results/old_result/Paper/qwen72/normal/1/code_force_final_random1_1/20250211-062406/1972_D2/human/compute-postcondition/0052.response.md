Output State: **`n` must be at least 28, `m` must be at least 21, `x` is 4, `y` is 5, and `cnt` remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
- After the third iteration, `x` is still 4, and `y` has been incremented to 4.
- For the fourth iteration, the conditions become `(4 + 4) * 4 <= n` and `(4 + 4) * 4 <= m`, which simplify to `32 <= n` and `32 <= m`.
- Since the conditions for the fourth iteration are not met (as `n` must be at least 28 and `m` must be at least 21, but not necessarily 32), the loop will terminate after the third iteration.
- Therefore, after all iterations, `x` remains 4, `y` is incremented to 5, and `cnt` remains unchanged.
