Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`, where `ind[0]` is the first element in the list `ind` (which is not 0), and `k` is 14.** 

To break it down:
- `ind[0]` is the first element in the list `ind`, which is not 0 and is an index of an element in `a` that is greater than `x`.
- `k` is 14.
- The program calculates two values: `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.
- It then returns the larger of these two values.
