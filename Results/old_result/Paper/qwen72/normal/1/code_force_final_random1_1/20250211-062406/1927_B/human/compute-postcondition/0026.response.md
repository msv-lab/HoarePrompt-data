Output State: **`j` is `l-1`, `l` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is updated by appending `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for each iteration from `j=0` to `j=l-1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`j` is `l-1`:** The loop variable `j` will reach the value `l-1` after the last iteration, as it starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration.
- **`l` is greater than or equal to 0:** The loop runs `l` times, so after the loop finishes, `l` remains the same as it was initially, which is a non-negative integer.
- **`ans` is updated by appending `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for each iteration from `j=0` to `j=l-1`:** The list `ans` is populated with the results of the expression `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for each value of `j` from 0 to `l-1`. This means that after the loop completes, `ans` will contain `l` elements, each corresponding to the result of the expression for the respective `j` value.
