Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_3()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l == r:
        if a[l] != 0:
            ops.append((l, l))
            a[l] = 0
        return
    func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)

        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
        func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` modifies a list `a` of integers and appends tuples to a list `ops` based on certain conditions. It accepts four parameters: `a` (a list of integers), `l` and `r` (integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a)), and `ops` (a list that will store tuples of integers representing the operations performed). The function does not return any value. If `l` equals `r` and `a[l]` is not zero, it sets `a[l]` to zero and appends the tuple `(l, l)` to `ops`. If `l` is not equal to `r` and `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it sets each element from index `l` to `r` in `a` to `r - l + 1` and appends the tuple `(l, r)` to `ops`. The function recursively calls itself with updated indices until the base case is met. After the function completes, `a` may have some elements modified to zero or `r - l + 1`, and `ops` will contain tuples representing the operations performed.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []

    recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)
    return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a list `a` of integers, where each integer is between 0 and \(10^7\). It returns a tuple containing three elements: the sum of all integers in the list `a`, the length of the list `ops`, and the list `ops` itself. The list `ops` is initially empty and may be modified by the `recursive_maximize_sum` function, which is called within `func_2`. After the function concludes, the sum of `a` is the total of all its elements, the length of `ops` is the number of elements in `ops`, and `ops` contains any elements that were added by the `recursive_maximize_sum` function.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
    else:
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if pos != l:
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        if pos != r:
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `recursive_maximize_sum` takes two parameters, `l` and `r`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), where `a` is a list of integers. The function modifies the list `a` and the list `ops`. If the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r+1]` is less than or equal to the square of the length of this sublist, the function updates the sublist `a[l:r+1]` to contain only the value of the length of the sublist, and appends the tuple `(l, r)` to the list `ops`. If the sum is greater, the function recursively processes the left and right sublists around the maximum element in the sublist `a[l:r+1]`. The function does not return any value. After the function completes, the list `a` will have been modified according to the rules described, and the list `ops` will contain tuples representing the ranges of indices that were processed.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (s, m, ops) = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the input, where each element is in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. It then calls another function `func_2` with `a` as an argument, which returns three values: `s` (the sum of the elements in `a`), `m` (the maximum value in `a`), and `ops` (a list of tuples). The function prints `s` and `m`, followed by each tuple in `ops` with each element incremented by 1. After the function completes, the input variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and the output is the printed values of `s`, `m`, and the modified tuples in `ops`.
