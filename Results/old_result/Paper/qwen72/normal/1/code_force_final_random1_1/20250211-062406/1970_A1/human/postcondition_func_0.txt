The function `func_1` takes two objects, `infoA` and `infoB`, each having attributes `balance` and `position`. It returns the difference between their balances if they are not equal, resulting in a non-zero integer. If the balances are equal, it returns the difference between their positions, which is a positive integer representing the distance between the positions of the characters in the input sequence. The function does not modify the input objects.
