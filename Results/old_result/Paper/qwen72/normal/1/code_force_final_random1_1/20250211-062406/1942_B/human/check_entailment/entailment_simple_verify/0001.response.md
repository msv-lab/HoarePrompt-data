### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires reconstructing a permutation `p` from an array `a` where `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The MEX of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the sequence.
   - Given `a`, we need to find a permutation `p` that satisfies the above condition.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes an array `res` of length `n` with `None` values to store the result.
   - It initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the initial assumption that the MEX of the entire permutation is `n`.

3. **Reconstructing the Permutation:**
   - The program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from the last element to the first).
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the permutation `res`, it prints the elements of `res` separated by spaces.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The key part of the algorithm is the update of `mex` and the calculation of `res[i]`.
   - The update `mex = mex - ar[i]` ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the permutation up to the current index.
   - The calculation `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` correctly reconstructs the permutation based on the given `a`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n` is small or large within the constraints.
   - It also handles the case where `a` contains negative values, which is valid according to the problem statement.

7. **Verification Using Annotations:**
   - The annotated code confirms that the program maintains the correct state throughout its execution.
   - The initial state of `mex` being set to `n` is appropriate because it assumes the highest possible MEX value initially.
   - The loop iterates in reverse, ensuring that the MEX is updated correctly as we move through the array.
   - The final state of `res` is a valid permutation that satisfies the given conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` from the array `a` based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
