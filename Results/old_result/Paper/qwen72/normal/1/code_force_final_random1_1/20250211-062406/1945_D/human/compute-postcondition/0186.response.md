Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 1` or less, `max_p` is greater than 1, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` starting from index `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1` plus `b_values[y]` plus `a_values[0]`, `custos` includes the final value of `custo`, `y` is such that `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, all other variables (`i`, `num_fila`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x`, and `a_values`) remain unchanged as described in the initial state, and `y` is currently 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
