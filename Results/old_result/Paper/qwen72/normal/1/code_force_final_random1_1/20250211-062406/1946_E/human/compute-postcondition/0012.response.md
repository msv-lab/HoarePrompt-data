The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are integers and `b` is non-negative. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- **Case_1**: If certain conditions are met, the function returns the tuple `(1, 0)`.
- **Case_2**: If the conditions for Case_1 are not met, the function returns the values `d` and `c`, which are the second and first values, respectively, returned by the function `func_1(b, a)`.
- **Case_3**: If the conditions for Case_1 and Case_2 are not met, and `a` is divisible by `b` with no remainder, the function returns a tuple `(1, -((a // b) - 1))`, where the second element of the tuple is the negative of the quotient of `a` divided by `b` minus 1.
- **Case_4**: If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns a tuple `(d, c - a // b * d)`, where `d` is the second value returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`, and `c - a // b * d` is calculated using the first value `c` returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`, the integer division of `a` by `b`, and `d`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` where `b` is non-negative. It returns a tuple based on specific conditions: (1, 0) in Case_1, (d, c) from `func_1(b, a)` in Case_2, (1, -((a // b) - 1)) if `a` is divisible by `b` with no remainder in Case_3, and (d, c - a // b * d) in Case_4.**
