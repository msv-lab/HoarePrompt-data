The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters within its definition. However, based on the context provided, it seems that the function might be designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m`, where both `n` and `m` are constrained to be between 1 and 100, inclusive. The total number of test cases, denoted by `t`, is also an integer and is constrained to be between 1 and 100, inclusive.

Since the specific output for each test case is not provided, we can infer that the function processes each test case and returns some result based on the values of `n` and `m` for each case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100), for a total of `t` test cases (1 <= t <= 100). It returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `m`.**
