Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is done using a loop that iterates `t` times. This part of the program is correct.

2. **Parsing Input**: For each test case, the program parses two integers `n` and `m` from the input. This is done correctly using list comprehension. This part of the program is also correct.

3. **Conditions**:
   - **Condition 1**: `if n == m:` This checks if the number of moves `n` is equal to the desired number of cubes `m`. If true, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can simply add one cube per move. This condition is correct.
   - **Condition 2**: `elif m > n:` This checks if the desired number of cubes `m` is greater than the number of moves `n`. If true, it prints 'No' because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves. This condition is correct.
   - **Condition 3**: `elif m == n - 1:` This checks if the desired number of cubes `m` is one less than the number of moves `n`. If true, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can add one cube in each move except the last one. This condition is correct.
   - **Condition 4**: `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:` This checks if both `m` and `n` are even. If true, it prints 'Yes' because an even number of moves can result in an even number of cubes. This condition is correct.
   - **Condition 5**: `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:` This checks if both `m` and `n` are odd. If true, it prints 'Yes' because an odd number of moves can result in an odd number of cubes. This condition is correct.
   - **Else**: If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'No'. This is the catch-all condition for cases not covered by the previous conditions. However, this condition might be too broad and could potentially miss some valid cases.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `m` is greater than `n` or when `m` and `n` have different parities correctly. However, there is a potential issue with the logic in the `else` block. Specifically, the program should consider whether the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which would allow for the possibility of reaching `m` cubes through a series of adds and removes.

5. **Output**: The program outputs 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case, which matches the problem requirements. However, the logic in the `else` block needs to be refined to ensure correctness.

Given the above reasoning, the program is mostly correct but has a potential issue in the `else` block. To address this, we can modify the `else` block to check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which would cover all valid cases.

**Modified Condition**:
```python
elif (n - m) % 2 == 0:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```

This modification ensures that the program correctly handles all valid cases.

Final: **False** (The original program has a logical flaw in the `else` block, which can be corrected as shown above.)
