You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, representing the number of cells. a is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing whether a cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1), and at least one cell contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `arr` is the last input string with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the last `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in the last `arr`, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the last `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in the last `arr`, `z` is the substring of the last `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1` if `x` and `y` are valid and `n - y > x`, otherwise `z` is an empty string.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array `arr` representing the ribbon.
   - The array `arr` is converted to a string by joining the input elements and removing spaces.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip:**
   - `x = arr.find('1')` finds the index of the first chip (from the left).
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the first chip from the right (by reversing the string and finding the first '1').

3. **Extracting the Substring with Chips:**
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]` extracts the substring from the first chip to the last chip, inclusive.
   - This ensures that we only consider the part of the ribbon that contains chips.

4. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - `print(z.count('0'))` counts the number of free cells ('0's) in the extracted substring.
   - This count represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `8\n0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
  - `arr = '01110110'`
  - `x = 1` (first '1' at index 1)
  - `y = 2` (first '1' from the right at index 6, so `n - y = 6`)
  - `z = '111011'`
  - `z.count('0') = 1`
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `6\n0 1 0 0 0 0`
  - `arr = '010000'`
  - `x = 1` (first '1' at index 1)
  - `y = 5` (first '1' from the right at index 1, so `n - y = 1`)
  - `z = '1'`
  - `z.count('0') = 0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `6\n1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - `arr = '111111'`
  - `x = 0` (first '1' at index 0)
  - `y = 0` (first '1' from the right at index 5, so `n - y = 6`)
  - `z = '111111'`
  - `z.count('0') = 0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `5\n1 0 1 0 1`
  - `arr = '10101'`
  - `x = 0` (first '1' at index 0)
  - `y = 1` (first '1' from the right at index 4, so `n - y = 4`)
  - `z = '10101'`
  - `z.count('0') = 2`
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `9\n0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
  - `arr = '011000110'`
  - `x = 1` (first '1' at index 1)
  - `y = 2` (first '1' from the right at index 7, so `n - y = 7`)
  - `z = '1100011'`
  - `z.count('0') = 3`
  - Output: `3` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and produces the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct.
