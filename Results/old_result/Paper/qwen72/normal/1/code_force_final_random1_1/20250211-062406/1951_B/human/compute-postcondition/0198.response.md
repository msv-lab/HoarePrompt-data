Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, and a list `s` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum of two counts: `ans` and `ans1`. `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the first element of `s` before any swaps. `ans1` is calculated after swapping the first element of `s` with another element, and it counts the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are equal to the first element (excluding the first occurrence) plus the number of elements that are less than the first element and come after the first occurrence of the first element in the list. The list `s` is modified during the process, but the original values of `n`, `k`, and the elements of `s` remain unchanged. **
