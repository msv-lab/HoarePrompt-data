Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are set to `a // 2`. If `b` is even, `b1` and `b2` are set to `b // 2`. If `a` is even and `a1` is not equal to `b`, or if `b` is even and `b1` is not equal to `a`, or if both `a` and `b` are odd, the current iteration is skipped. If `b` is even and `b1` is equal to `a`, the program does not skip the current iteration.***
