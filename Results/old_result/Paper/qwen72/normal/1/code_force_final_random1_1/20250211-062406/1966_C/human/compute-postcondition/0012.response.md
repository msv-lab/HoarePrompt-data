Output State: **`dp` is updated to `arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1 or not dp`, `i` is `i + 1`, `tc` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, and `i` must be less than `len(arr)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `dp` is updated based on the condition `arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1 or not dp`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `tc`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `i` must be less than `len(arr)` still holds true.
