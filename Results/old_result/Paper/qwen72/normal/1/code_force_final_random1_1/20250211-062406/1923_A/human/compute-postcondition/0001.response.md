The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`n` and `a`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the purpose of the loop's execution.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
