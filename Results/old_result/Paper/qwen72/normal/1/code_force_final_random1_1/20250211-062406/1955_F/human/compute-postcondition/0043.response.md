The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts a set of parameters related to a sequence of numbers where each number (1, 2, 3, 4) has a count (`p_i`). The function processes these counts to determine some output.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `p_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200, representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence, respectively.

The function's output is not explicitly stated, but it is implied that the function processes these counts to produce some result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it accepts four integers `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `p_4` representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in a sequence, respectively. It processes these counts and returns a result for each test case.**
