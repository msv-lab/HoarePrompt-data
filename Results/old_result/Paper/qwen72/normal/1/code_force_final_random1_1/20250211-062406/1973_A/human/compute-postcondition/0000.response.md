Output State: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), representing the number of test cases. cas_de_test is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30), representing the scores of the three players in each test case. resultats is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `resultats`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `cas_de_test`, which remain as described in the initial state. The only change is that `resultats` is now an empty list.
