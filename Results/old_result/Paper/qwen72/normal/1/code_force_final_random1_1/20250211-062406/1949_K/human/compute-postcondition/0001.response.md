Output State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order where 1 ≤ `numbers[i]` ≤ 10^9. `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes three new lists, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`, to empty lists. The values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers` remain unchanged.
