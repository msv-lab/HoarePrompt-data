Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` and `k` are input integers, `n` must be non-zero and greater than 1, `L` is [m, m], `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2` which simplifies to `n - m`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `L` is `[m]`, where `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The code `L.append(m)` adds the value of `m` to the list `L`.
- After the execution, `L` becomes `[m, m]`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The value of `m` remains `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The value of `n` remains `n - (n + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `n - m`.
