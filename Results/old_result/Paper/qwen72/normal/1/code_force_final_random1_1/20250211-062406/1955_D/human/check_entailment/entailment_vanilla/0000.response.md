### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function initializes `cnt_b` as a list of zeros with a size of `max_val + 1` to keep track of the frequency of elements in array `b`.
   - It reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the elements of arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Counting Elements in `b`:**
   - It updates the `cnt_b` list to count the occurrences of each element in `b`.
   - It creates a set `b_values` from `b` to quickly check if an element in `a` is in `b`.

3. **Initial Window Check:**
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the number of good subsegments.
   - It initializes `curr` to 0, which will count the number of matching elements in the current window of size `m`.
   - It checks the first window of size `m` in `a`:
     - For each element in the first window, if it is in `b_values`, it decrements its count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count is non-negative.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans`.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - It slides the window one element at a time from the start to the end of `a`:
     - For the element leaving the window (`a[i]`), if it is in `b_values`, it increments its count in `cnt_b` and decrements `curr` if the count becomes positive.
     - For the element entering the window (`a[i + m]`), if it is in `b_values`, it decrements its count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count is non-negative.
     - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans`.

5. **Resetting Counts:**
   - After processing each test case, it resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to 0 to prepare for the next test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the sliding window technique to count the number of good subsegments in `a` for each test case. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
