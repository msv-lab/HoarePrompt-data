The function `func_3` takes two parameters: `arr`, a list of elements that can be converted to strings, and `sym`, a string. It returns a single string that is the result of concatenating each element in `arr` (converted to a string) followed by `sym`, except that `sym` is not appended after the last element in `arr`. After the function concludes, the input parameters `arr` and `sym` remain unchanged, and the returned string reflects the described concatenation.
