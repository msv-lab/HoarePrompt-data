Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. Additionally, either `obj` is not equal to `.B` or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is not a player, and either `obj` is not a player or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`. `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`. The current value of `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, indicating that `pos` is within a goal area. `team` is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`. `points[team]` is increased by 1.**
