### Reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Function Call in `func_2`**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `ops` list, which is required by `func_1`. This will indeed result in a `NameError` because `ops` is not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the MEX calculation in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, but the current implementation sets the value to `r - l + 1`, which is not necessarily the correct MEX.

3. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**:
   - The original assessment correctly states that the condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` in `recursive_maximize_sum` is not a valid check for determining whether to apply the MEX operation. The correct approach would be to calculate the MEX and then update the subarray accordingly.

4. **Incorrect Base Case in `func_1`**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the base case in `func_1` where `l == r` sets the element to 0 if it is not already 0. This is not always the correct MEX value for a single-element subarray.

### Corrected Version:
The provided corrected version in the original assessment is indeed correct. It includes a proper MEX calculation function and correctly applies the MEX operation to the subarrays. The corrected version ensures that the MEX is calculated correctly and the operations are applied as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the issues identified in the original assessment and the correctness of the provided corrected version, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
