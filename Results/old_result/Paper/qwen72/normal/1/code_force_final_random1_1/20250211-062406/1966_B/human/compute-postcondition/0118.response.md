To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the condition that determines whether the loop will execute is `range(n - 1)`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1.
3. **Initial State of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0 (the starting point of the range).

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n` must be greater than 1**: This is already given in the initial state (`n` is the first integer from the input, greater than 1).
- **`i` must be 0**: This is the starting value for the loop.

### Final State:
The state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute. The other variables and conditions should remain as they are, as they do not affect the loop head directly.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input (greater than 1), `m` is the second integer from the input (greater than 1), `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is a user's input), `i` is 0, `j` is `m-2`, the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, `impossible` is `True`, `ans` remains 'YES'.**
