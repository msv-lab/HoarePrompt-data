Reasoning:  

The program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, given the launch frequencies of two installations and the visibility duration of each firework. The logic involves calculating the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m` (`mn = min(a, b) + m`) and then determining the number of fireworks visible based on certain conditions.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Visibility**: The variable `mn` is calculated as `min(a, b) + m`. This is intended to represent the time window during which the maximum number of fireworks could be visible. However, this calculation does not accurately capture the overlapping periods of visibility for fireworks launched by both installations.

2. **Divisibility Check**: The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and a != 1 and b != 1:` is incorrect. The goal is to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, not to check if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`. This condition is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

3. **Output Calculation**: The output calculation `print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)` and `print(mn // a + mn // b)` are also incorrect. These calculations do not correctly account for the overlapping visibility periods of fireworks launched by both installations.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of simultaneous launches and the visibility window of `m + 1` minutes.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the least common multiple of a and b
        l = lcm(a, b)
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time
        max_visible = 1 + (m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b - (m + 1) // l
        
        print(max_visible)
```

Explanation:
- **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of `a` and `b` is used to determine the periodicity of simultaneous launches.
- **Visibility Calculation**: The formula `(m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b - (m + 1) // l` calculates the total number of fireworks visible at the same time, considering the overlap.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
