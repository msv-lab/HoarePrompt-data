Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value (1) and `i` (1), `i` is 1, `int(sqrt(x))` must be at least 1, and the current value of `i` divides `x` without a remainder. Additionally, `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` without a remainder. Therefore, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`.**
