Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the count of '1' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, and `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where `zero * 100 // (i + 1)` and `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)` are both greater than or equal to 50.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n - 1` times, so `i` will be `n - 2` after the last iteration.
- `zero` and `one` will accumulate the counts of '0' and '1' characters, respectively, from the first `n - 1` characters of `s`.
- `zero_perc` will be the percentage of '0' characters in the first `i + 1` characters.
- `one_perc` will be the percentage of remaining '1' characters in the remaining part of the string.
- `lst` will contain all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50.
