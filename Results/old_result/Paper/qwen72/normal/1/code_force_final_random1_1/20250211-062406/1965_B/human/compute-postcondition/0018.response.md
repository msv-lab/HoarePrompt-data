Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`, `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, `b` is the binary string of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary string of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is an empty list, `lk` is the length of `bk`.**

Explanation:
- The code `lk = len(bk)` calculates the length of the binary string `bk` and assigns it to the variable `lk`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The new variable `lk` is now part of the output state, representing the length of the binary string `bk`.
