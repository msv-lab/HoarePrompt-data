The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which is then stored in the variable `data`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, or `r` directly, but it changes the state of the program by introducing the new variable `data`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `q` are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30; each query consists of two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
