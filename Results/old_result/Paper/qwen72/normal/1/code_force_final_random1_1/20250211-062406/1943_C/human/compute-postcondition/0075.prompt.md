You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads input from stdin, where the first input is an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, followed by `n - 1` lines, each containing two integers `u` and `v` representing an edge between vertices `u` and `v`. The vertices are 1-indexed, and the edges form a tree.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` remains greater than 1, and `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `i+1` in the tree. The values of `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input, each decremented by 1.
    d, _ = bfs(0)
    a = func_1(d)
    d, previous = bfs(a)
    b = func_1(d)

        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `path_ba` contains the full path from vertex `b` back to the starting vertex `a` (or the root of the BFS tree), with each element in the list representing a vertex in the path. The variable `n` will be `-1` because the loop breaks when `n` becomes `-1`. All other variables (`u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `previous`, `_`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

        c = path_ba[ci]
        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `path_ba` contains the full path from vertex `b` back to the starting vertex `a` (or the root of the BFS tree) and has an odd number of elements, `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, `i` is equal to `ci + 1`, `n` is `-1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`, where `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`, and all other variables (`u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `previous`, `_`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
    else :
        c2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        c1 = c2 - 1
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: After all iterations of the loop, `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd `i` from 1 up to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`, where `c1` is `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1` and `c2` is `len(path_ba) / 2`. The length of `path_ba` remains even, and all other variables (`u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `previous`, `_`, `b`, `n`) remain unchanged.
    #State: *After all iterations of the loop, `path_ba` contains the full path from vertex `b` back to the starting vertex `a` (or the root of the BFS tree). If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, `i` is equal to `ci + 1`, `n` is `-1`, and `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`, where `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd `i` from 1 up to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`, where `c1` is `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1` and `c2` is `len(path_ba) / 2`. In both cases, all other variables (`u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `previous`, `_`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: len(ops) (where len(ops) is L // 2 + 1 if the length of path_ba is odd, or L // 4 if the length of path_ba is even)

    return None
    #The program returns None. The variables `u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `previous`, `_`, `b`, `path_ba`, `ci`, `i`, `n`, and `ops` remain unchanged from their initial state. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, `i` is `ci + 1`, `n` is `-1`, and `ops` contains tuples from `(c, 0)` to `(c, ci)`, where `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd `i` from 1 up to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`, where `c1` is `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1` and `c2` is `len(path_ba) / 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from standard input (stdin), where the first input is an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, followed by `n - 1` lines, each containing two integers `u` and `v` representing an edge between vertices `u` and `v`. The function processes this input to determine the operations needed based on the path between two vertices in the tree. If the length of the path is odd, it calculates a set of operations involving the middle vertex of the path. If the length of the path is even, it calculates a set of operations involving two middle vertices of the path. The function returns `None` and does not modify the variables `u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `previous`, `_`, `b`, `path_ba`, `ci`, `i`, `n`, and `ops` except for the changes made to `ops` as described.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None. The variables `u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `previous`, `_`, `b`, `path_ba`, `ci`, `i`, `n`, and `ops` remain unchanged from their initial state. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`, `i` is `ci + 1`, `n` is `-1`, and `ops` contains tuples from `(c, 0)` to `(c, ci)`, where `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd `i` from 1 up to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`, where `c1` is `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1` and `c2` is `len(path_ba) / 2`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
