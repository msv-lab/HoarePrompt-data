Output State: **The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus `count_num` if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `start` is the maximum value encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value encountered when `t` is 2, and `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive).**
