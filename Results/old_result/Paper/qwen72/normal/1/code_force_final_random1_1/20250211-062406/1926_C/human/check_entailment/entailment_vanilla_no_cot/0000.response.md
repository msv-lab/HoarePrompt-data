Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct for the given problem description. It precomputes the sums of the digit sums for all numbers up to 200,000 and stores these values in a list `A`. For each test case, it retrieves the precomputed sum corresponding to the input number `n` and prints it. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a number, which is used in the precomputation step. This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and can handle the time constraint of 0.5 seconds per test.
