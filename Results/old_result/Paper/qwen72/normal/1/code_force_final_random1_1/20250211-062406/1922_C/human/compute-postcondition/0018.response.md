Output State: **`t` is an integer where 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 3, `n` is equal to `t` and greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d1[3]` is `l[2] - l[1] + d1[2]`, `d1[4]` is `l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`, `d1[5]` is `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`, and `d2` remains a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `d1`, and `d2`.
- The code snippet updates `d1[i + 2]` to be `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.
- Given `i` is 3, `i + 2` is 5.
- Therefore, `d1[5]` is updated to `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`.
- The values of `d1[3]` and `d1[4]` are already determined based on the initial conditions and the previous logic.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
