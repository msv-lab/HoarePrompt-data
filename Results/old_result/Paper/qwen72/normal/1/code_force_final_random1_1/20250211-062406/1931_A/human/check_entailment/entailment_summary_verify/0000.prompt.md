You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple integers from the user, each representing an encoded value of a three-letter word. For each integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78), it generates and prints a corresponding three-letter word based on the following rules: If `n` is between 53 and 78 (inclusive), the word is the character from the alphabet corresponding to the position `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 27 and 52 (inclusive), the word is 'a' followed by the character at position `n - 28` in the alphabet, followed by 'z'. If `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), the word is 'aa' followed by the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet. The function does not return any value; it only prints the generated words.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest word is flawed. Here's a counterexample:

For the input `n = 48`, the program outputs `auz`. However, the correct output should be `auz` (which is correct), but let's consider another case:

For the input `n = 55`, the program outputs `czz`. However, the correct output should be `bzz`.

The issue lies in the logic for constructing the word when `n > 52`. The program adds the character at position `n - 53` followed by `zz`, which is not always the lexicographically smallest word. For example, for `n = 55`, the correct word should be `bzz` (since `b` is lexicographically smaller than `c`).

To fix this, the program should correctly handle the construction of the lexicographically smallest word for all possible values of `n`.
