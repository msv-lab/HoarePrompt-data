### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For \(b = 1\), \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\), so all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid.
   - For \(b > 1\), we need to ensure that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The given program initializes `ans` with `n`, which correctly accounts for all pairs \((a, 1)\).
   - It then iterates over possible values of \(b\) starting from 2 up to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values using the following steps:
     - `countmins = count - 1`
     - `g = n // count`
     - If `g < countmins`, it breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it updates `ans` with `g // count + 1`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The initialization of `ans` with `n` is correct because it counts all pairs \((a, 1)\).
   - The loop starts from \(b = 2\) and iterates up to \(m\), which is correct.
   - The condition `if g < countmins` is used to break the loop early if no more valid pairs can be found, which is a reasonable optimization.
   - The update `ans += g // count + 1` is intended to count valid pairs, but this formula needs to be carefully examined.

5. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula `g = n // count` calculates the maximum possible value of \(a\) that is a multiple of \(b\).
   - The condition `if g < countmins` ensures that the loop stops if the maximum possible \(a\) is less than \(b - 1\), which is a valid optimization.
   - The update `ans += g // count + 1` is intended to count the number of valid \(a\) values for the current \(b\). However, this formula is not clearly derived from the problem statement and may not correctly count all valid pairs.

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The formula `g // count + 1` does not directly correspond to the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The logic for counting valid pairs when \(b > 1\) is not clearly derived and may lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The specific formula used for counting valid pairs when \(b > 1\) is not derived from the problem statement and may lead to incorrect results.

Final: **False**
