Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. Specifically, the logic for determining the visibility period and the conditions under which the number of visible fireworks is calculated is incorrect.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Visibility Period**: The variable `mn` is defined as `min(a, b) + m`, which does not correctly represent the period during which fireworks are visible. The visibility period should be considered over the entire time span where fireworks are launched, not just the minimum launch interval plus the visibility duration.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Special Case**: The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1)` is not appropriate for determining the special case where the number of visible fireworks is calculated differently. This condition is too restrictive and does not cover all scenarios where the visibility overlap needs to be considered.

3. **Incorrect Formula for Maximum Visible Fireworks**: The formula `print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)` and `print(mn // a + mn // b)` are not correct for calculating the maximum number of visible fireworks. The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the overlap and then calculating the number of visible fireworks accordingly.

A correct approach would involve:

- Calculating the LCM of `a` and `b` to find the periodicity of overlaps.
- Determining the number of fireworks launched within the visibility window.
- Adjusting for the overlap to ensure the maximum number of visible fireworks is correctly calculated.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        max_visible = 1 + (m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b - (m + 1) // lcm_ab
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This corrected version uses the LCM to handle the overlap correctly and ensures that the maximum number of visible fireworks is calculated accurately.
