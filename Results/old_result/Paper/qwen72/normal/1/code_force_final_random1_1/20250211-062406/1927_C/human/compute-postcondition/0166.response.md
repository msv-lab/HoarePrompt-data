The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case involves four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and two arrays `a` and `b`. Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5.
  - `k` is an even integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m).
  - Arrays `a` and `b` contain `n` and `m` integers respectively, where each element is an integer in the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6.

The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the parameters and arrays provided for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and two arrays `a` and `b`. It returns a result for each test case based on the given parameters and arrays.**
