Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples with `t` tuples, and `resultats` is a list containing `t` elements. Each element in `resultats` corresponds to the result of the respective tuple in `cas_de_test`. For each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in `cas_de_test`:
- If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` (`total_points`) is odd, the corresponding element in `resultats` is `-1`.
- If `total_points` is even, `total_matchs` is calculated as `total_points // 2`. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, the corresponding element in `resultats` is `-1`.
- If neither of the above conditions is met, `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If `egalites` is less than 0, the corresponding element in `resultats` is `-1`. Otherwise, the corresponding element in `resultats` is `egalites // 2`.**
