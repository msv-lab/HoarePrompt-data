Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `i` is equal to `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `p[b] - p[a - 1]` to the variable `s`. The values of `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new state includes the updated value of `s` as specified by the code.
