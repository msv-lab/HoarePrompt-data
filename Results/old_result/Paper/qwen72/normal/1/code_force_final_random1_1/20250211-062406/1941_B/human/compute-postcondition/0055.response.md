Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `opNum` is `a[0]`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - opNum`, `a[1]` is updated to `a[1] - 2 * opNum`, `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] - opNum`. If `a[0]` was less than 0, `stop` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stop` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[2]` is updated by subtracting `opNum` from its current value.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `opNum`, `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `stop`) retain their values or conditions as described in the initial state.
