Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 26 (inclusive), `word` is 'aa' followed by the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet.**

Explanation:
- The variable `i` remains unchanged at 0.
- The variable `n` remains an integer between 3 and 26 (inclusive).
- The variable `word` was initially an empty string. After executing the code, `word` is updated to be the string 'aa' concatenated with the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet. For example, if `n` is 5, then `word` becomes 'aa' + 'c' (since 'a' is the 1st character, 'b' is the 2nd, and 'c' is the 3rd, and `n - 3` is 2).
