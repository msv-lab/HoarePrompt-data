Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the satisfaction of residents on both sides of the road. Specifically, the program uses percentages to check if more than half of the residents on each side are satisfied, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results due to rounding issues.

Additionally, the program does not handle the edge cases correctly, such as when the road is placed before the first house or after the last house. The program should explicitly check these conditions to ensure that the constraints are met.

Here is a specific test case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
3
001
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Actual Output:
```
0
```

In this case, the road should be placed after the first house (position 1) to satisfy the condition that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. However, the program incorrectly outputs 0, indicating that the road should be placed before the first house, which does not satisfy the condition for the right side of the road.
