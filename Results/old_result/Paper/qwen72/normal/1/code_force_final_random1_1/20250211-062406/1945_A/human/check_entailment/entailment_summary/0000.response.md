Reasoning:  
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by adjusting the number of extroverts (`b`) with the number of universals (`c`). However, the logic used to determine the minimum number of tents required is flawed. Specifically, the expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is not correctly handling the conditions for the number of tents required.

1. **Introverts (`a`)**: Each introvert needs a separate tent, so the number of tents required for introverts is simply `a`.

2. **Extroverts (`b`)**: Each extrovert requires a tent with exactly two other people. Therefore, the number of tents required for extroverts is `b / 3` (rounded up to the nearest integer).

3. **Universals (`c`)**: Universals can be placed in any tent configuration. They can fill in the remaining spots in tents with extroverts or form their own tents.

The key issue in the provided solution is the incorrect handling of the universals and the calculation of the total number of tents. The expression `b += c` incorrectly assumes that all universals can be treated as extroverts, which is not always the case. Additionally, the condition `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is not correctly checking if it's possible to form the required tents.

A correct approach would be:
1. Calculate the number of tents required for introverts: `a`.
2. Calculate the number of tents required for extroverts: `b // 3` (if `b % 3 == 0`) or `b // 3 + 1` (if `b % 3 != 0`).
3. Use universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents with extroverts.
4. If there are still universals left, they can form their own tents.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 1
    t = int(data[0])
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(data[index])
        b = int(data[index + 1])
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        
        # Tents for introverts
        tents = a
        
        # Tents for extroverts
        if b % 3 == 0:
            tents += b // 3
        else:
            tents += b // 3 + 1
            c -= (3 - b % 3)
        
        # Check if we have enough universals to fill the remaining spots
        if c < 0:
            results.append(-1)
            continue
        
        # Tents for remaining universals
        tents += (c + 2) // 3
        
        results.append(tents)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func()
```

Given the above reasoning, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
