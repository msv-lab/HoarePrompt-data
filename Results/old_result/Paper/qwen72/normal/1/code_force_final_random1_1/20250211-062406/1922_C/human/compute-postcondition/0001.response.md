Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and greater than 0**. 

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. According to the initial state, `int(input())` must be equal to `t` and greater than 0. Therefore, `n` is now equal to `t`, and both `n` and `t` are integers within the range 1 to 10^4. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 0.
