### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the function summaries to evaluate the correctness of the solution.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Sorting by Distance**:
   - The function sorts the indices of the monsters based on their absolute distances from the player. This ensures that the closest monsters are handled first, which is crucial because the closest monsters pose the greatest threat.
   - This step is correct and aligns with the problem's requirement to prioritize closer monsters.

2. **Handling Monsters**:
   - The function iterates through the sorted indices and attempts to reduce the health of each monster using up to `k` bullets per second.
   - It keeps track of the distance from the player and checks if any monster reaches the player's position (distance 0).
   - This step is also correct and aligns with the problem's requirement to handle monsters in each second and check for the player's survival.

3. **Termination Conditions**:
   - If a monster reaches the player's position (`abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`), the function returns `False`, indicating that the player loses.
   - If all monsters are killed before any of them reach the player, the function returns `True`, indicating that the player wins.
   - These conditions are correctly implemented and cover the necessary scenarios.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, the list of monster healths `a`, and the list of monster positions `x`.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns `True`, otherwise 'NO'.
   - This function correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each one independently.

#### Edge Cases:
- **Large `k`**: If `k` is large enough to kill all monsters in one second, the program will correctly handle this scenario.
- **Small `k`**: If `k` is small and the player cannot kill all monsters before they reach the player, the program will correctly identify this and return 'NO'.
- **Monsters Close to Player**: If the monsters are already very close to the player, the program will correctly check if the player can survive and return the appropriate result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles sorting, iteration, and termination conditions appropriately. The function summaries confirm that the program processes each test case correctly and prints the expected results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
