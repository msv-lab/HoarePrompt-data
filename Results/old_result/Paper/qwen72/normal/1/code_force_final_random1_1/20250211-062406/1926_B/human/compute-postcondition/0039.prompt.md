Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, the grid is represented by n lines of n characters (each character is either '0' or '1'), the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1, `a` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b = input()
    if '1' in b:
        k.append(b.count('1'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is a positive integer greater than 0, `b` is a user input string. If `b` contains the character '1', `k` is a list that includes the count of '1' characters in `b`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`_` is a positive integer greater than 1, `b` is a user input string, and `k` remains unchanged. If '1' is in `b`, `k` is a list with an additional element representing the count of '1's in `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`_` is a positive integer greater than 2, `b` is a user input string, and `k` remains unchanged unless '1' is found in `b`, in which case `k` is updated to include the count of '1's in `b` as its last element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
