The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `m - 1`. If `j` is less than `m - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `m` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `m` is greater than 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is 2. If the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the first string in `gr`, or the first character of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the last string in `gr`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.**
