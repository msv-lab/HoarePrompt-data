Reasoning:

The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by checking specific conditions related to the first and last elements of the array. However, these conditions do not fully capture the requirements of the problem. Specifically, the logic only checks the parity and relative values of the first two and last two elements, which is insufficient to determine if the entire array can be reduced to zeros using the allowed operations.

To correctly determine if the array can be reduced to zeros, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Sum of Elements**: The sum of the elements in the array must be even. This is because each operation reduces the sum by 4 (since \(a_{i-1}\), \(a_i\), and \(a_{i+1}\) are all decreased by a total of 4).

2. **Parity of Elements**: Each element in the array must be able to be reduced to zero by the operations. This means that the cumulative effect of the operations should allow all elements to reach zero without leaving any non-zero values.

3. **Feasibility of Operations**: The operations can only be applied to indices \(2 \le i \le n-1\). Therefore, the first and last elements of the array cannot be directly modified by the operations. They must be able to be reduced to zero through the cumulative effect of the operations on the other elements.

Given these points, the provided solution is incorrect because it only checks the first and last elements and their immediate neighbors, which is not sufficient to ensure that the entire array can be reduced to zeros.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
