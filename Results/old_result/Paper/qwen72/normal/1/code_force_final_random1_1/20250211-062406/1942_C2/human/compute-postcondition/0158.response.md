Output State: **`i` is the last element of `val`, `val` remains a non-empty list sorted with odd numbers first followed by even numbers, both groups in ascending order, `x` is the final value of `x` (unchanged from its value when the loop started), `c` is the last element of `val` divided by 2, `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` up to the point where `y` becomes less than `c` (if such a condition occurs) or the sum of all elements in `val` plus any additional adjustments based on the `y < c` condition, `y` is reduced by the sum of the integer division of each element in `val` by 2 up to the point where the loop breaks (if it does), `cons` is `x + sx - 2`.** 

Explanation:
- The code `cons = x + sx - 2` assigns the value of `x + sx - 2` to the variable `cons`.
- All other variables (`i`, `val`, `x`, `c`, `sx`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their values in the initial state.
- The value of `cons` is calculated based on the current values of `x` and `sx`, and the constant `-2`.
