The code snippet `sm = sm % (10 ** 9 + 7)` updates the value of `sm` by taking the remainder of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\). This operation ensures that `sm` remains within a manageable range, typically used in problems to prevent integer overflow.

Given the initial state:
- `n` remains greater than 0
- `i` is `n`
- `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index
- `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index
- `sm` is now `sm * 2 + suf[n]`
- `sm` is greater than or equal to 0

After executing the code snippet:
- `sm` is updated to `sm % (10 ** 9 + 7)`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` remains greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index, `sm` is now `sm % (10 ** 9 + 7)` and is greater than or equal to 0.**
