Postcondition: **`a` is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each element a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to `a[k]` where `k` is 14 if the condition `k == 14` is true; `ind` is an empty list; `c` is 0 because there are no elements in `a` greater than `x`; `i` is the index of the last element checked in the loop, which could be any value from 0 to n-1 depending on when the loop breaks or completes; `n` is the length of the list `a`.**
