Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are the input integers, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
