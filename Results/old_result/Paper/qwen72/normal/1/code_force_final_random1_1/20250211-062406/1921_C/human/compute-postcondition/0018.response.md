Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 3, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, and `array2` contains the elements it had before. If `arr[3] - arr[2] < b / a`, then `array2` contains the elements it had before plus the new element `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`.***
