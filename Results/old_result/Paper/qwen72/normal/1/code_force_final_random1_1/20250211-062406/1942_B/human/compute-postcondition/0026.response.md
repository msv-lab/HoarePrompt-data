The code snippet `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` updates the list `res` at index `i` with the value of `mex - ar[i]`. Let's break down the changes:

- `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, which means `i` is the last index of the list `ar`.
- `mex` is equal to `n`.
- `ar[i]` is the last element of the list `ar`.

So, the value of `res[i]` is set to `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None` except `res[len(ar) - 1]` which is now `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `mex` is now equal to `n`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`**.
