The code snippet `gr.append(input())` appends the user's input to the list `gr`. Since `gr` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `gr` will contain one element which is the input provided by the user.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input (greater than 1), `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing one element (the user's input), `i` is 0, `j` is `m-2`, `ans` is determined based on conditions involving `gr` and `impossible`.**
