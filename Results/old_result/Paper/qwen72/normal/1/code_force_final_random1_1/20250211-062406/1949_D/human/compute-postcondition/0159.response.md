Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 1. If the character at position `[i][j - 1]` (which is 0) of the string `xx[i]` is not '?', then `nx` is the character at position 0 of the string `xx[2]`. If the character at position `[i][j - 1]` is '?', and either `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.***
