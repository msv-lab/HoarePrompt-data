Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and verify the solution step-by-step using the annotated code and the problem description.

### Issues Identified in the Original Program:
1. **Initialization of `mex`**:
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is incorrect. The MEX of an empty array is 0, not `n`.
   - Correct initialization should be `mex = 0`.

2. **Updating `mex`**:
   - The condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]` is always true because `mex - ar[i]` is always less than `mex`.
   - This leads to `mex` being updated to `mex - ar[i]` unconditionally, which can result in incorrect values.
   - The correct approach is to use a set to keep track of the elements that have been used and update `mex` accordingly.

3. **Handling MEX correctly**:
   - The MEX of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the sequence.
   - The program should maintain this property by checking the smallest missing integer at each step.

### Corrected Program:
The corrected program uses a set to keep track of the elements that have been used and correctly computes the MEX at each step.

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        used = set()
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex + ar[i]
            used.add(res[i])
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))

func()
```

### Verification Using the Annotated Code:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is read from input and is a valid integer within the specified range.
   - `ar` is read from input and is a list of integers within the specified range.
   - `res` is initialized to a list of `None` values of length `n`.
   - `used` is initialized to an empty set.
   - `mex` is initialized to 0, which is correct.

2. **Loop**:
   - The loop iterates from `len(ar) - 1` to `0` (inclusive).
   - `res[i]` is set to `mex + ar[i]`.
   - `used` is updated to include `res[i]`.
   - `mex` is incremented until it is not in `used`, ensuring it is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.

3. **Output**:
   - The result is printed as a space-separated string of integers.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identified the flaws in the initial program and provided a corrected version that addresses these issues. The corrected program maintains the correct MEX value and constructs the permutation as required.

Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect, and the assessment is accurate.)
