The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `t` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, and `m` is the second integer from the new input. If `n` == `m`, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. If `m` > `n`, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. If `m` ≤ `n`, and `m` equals `n - 1`, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. If `m` ≤ `n`, and `m` does not equal `n - 1`, and both `m` and `n` are even or either `m` or `n` is odd, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` also remain unchanged.**
