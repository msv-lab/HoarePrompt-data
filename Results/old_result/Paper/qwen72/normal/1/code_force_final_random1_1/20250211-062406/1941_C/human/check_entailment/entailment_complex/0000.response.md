Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the given string `s` and then printing the sum of these counts. However, this approach is incorrect because it only counts the exact occurrences of "map" and "pie" as whole substrings, rather than considering the minimum number of deletions required to remove these substrings entirely.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the minimum number of deletions required to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" appears as a substring in the resulting string. This involves more complex logic, such as using dynamic programming or a sliding window approach to find the minimum deletions.

Here's a brief outline of the correct approach:
1. For each test case, read the string `s`.
2. Use a sliding window or dynamic programming to find the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie".
3. Print the result for each test case.

The current program simply counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" and adds them together, which does not solve the problem as specified. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
