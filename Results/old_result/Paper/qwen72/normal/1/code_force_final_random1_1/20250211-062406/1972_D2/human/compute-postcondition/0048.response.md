To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State:**
   - `n` must be at least 20
   - `m` must be at least 5
   - `x` is 4
   - `y` is 3
   - `cnt` remains unchanged

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

3. **Evaluate the Conditions:**
   - Calculate `(x + y) * x`:
     \[
     (4 + 3) * 4 = 7 * 4 = 28
     \]
   - Calculate `(x + y) * y`:
     \[
     (4 + 3) * 3 = 7 * 3 = 21
     \]

4. **Check the Conditions:**
   - For the first condition `(x + y) * x <= n`:
     \[
     28 <= n
     \]
     Since `n` must be at least 20, this condition is not satisfied because 28 is greater than 20.
   - For the second condition `(x + y) * y <= m`:
     \[
     21 <= m
     \]
     Since `m` must be at least 5, this condition is not satisfied because 21 is greater than 5.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To satisfy the first condition `(x + y) * x <= n`, `n` must be at least 28.
- To satisfy the second condition `(x + y) * y <= m`, `m` must be at least 21.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be at least 28, `m` must be at least 21, `x` is 4, `y` is 3, and `cnt` remains unchanged**
