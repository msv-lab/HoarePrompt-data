Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `t - 1`, `a` is the last input integer where 1 ≤ a, `s` is the last input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the last `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the last `s`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains the same as it was initially, representing the total number of test cases.
- The loop counter `_` will be equal to `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all but one iteration (since the loop starts from 0).
- The variable `a` holds the last input integer provided for the final test case.
- The variable `s` holds the last input string provided for the final test case.
- The variable `x` holds the count of the substring 'map' in the last input string `s`.
- The variable `y` holds the count of the substring 'pie' in the last input string `s`.
