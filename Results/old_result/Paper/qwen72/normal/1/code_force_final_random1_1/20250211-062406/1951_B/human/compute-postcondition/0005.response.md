Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each element a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to `a[k]`; `ind` is a list containing the index `i`; `c` is 0; `i` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; the current value of `a[i]` is greater than `x`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `i` to the list `ind`. Since `i` was initially 0, the list `ind` now contains the single element 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
