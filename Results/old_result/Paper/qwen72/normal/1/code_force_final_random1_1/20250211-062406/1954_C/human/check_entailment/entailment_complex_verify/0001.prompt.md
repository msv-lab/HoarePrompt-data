You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` is decremented by the number of iterations that were performed, but it remains within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The variables `x` and `y` are unchanged and still represent strings of integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. For each iteration, the lists `a` and `b` are updated with the digits from the new input strings `x` and `y`. The lists `new` and `new2` are generated for each iteration, where `new` contains the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for the first part of the list and the minimum value for the second part (if any), and `new2` contains the opposite. After all iterations, the final state of `a` and `b` will reflect the last input strings processed, and `new` and `new2` will be the final lists generated from these inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple pairs of digit-only strings `x` and `y` from the standard input, up to `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each pair, it generates two new strings: one by taking the maximum digit at each position and another by taking the minimum digit at each position. It prints these two strings for each pair. The function does not return any value. After all iterations, the variable `t` is effectively reduced by the number of iterations performed, but the original input strings `x` and `y` remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Digit Conversion**: For each test case, the function converts the input strings `a` and `b` into lists of integers. This is necessary because we need to manipulate individual digits.

3. **Initialization**: Two lists `new` and `new2` are initialized to store the resulting digits after the swaps. This is a good approach to keep track of the changes.

4. **Equality Check**: The function iterates through the digits of `a` and `b` and checks if they are equal. If they are equal, it assigns the same value to both `new` and `new2`. This is correct because swapping identical digits does not change the product.

5. **First Non-Equal Digit**: When the first non-equal digit is found, the function assigns the maximum of the two digits to `new` and the minimum to `new2`. This is correct because it ensures that the larger digit is placed in `new`, which helps in maximizing the product.

6. **Remaining Digits**: For the remaining digits, the function assigns the minimum of the two digits to `new` and the maximum to `new2`. This is also correct because it ensures that the smaller digit is placed in `new`, which helps in maximizing the product when combined with the previous steps.

7. **Output**: Finally, the function prints the resulting numbers as strings. This is correct as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem requirements and follows the logic to maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping digits. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
