Reasoning:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The function `func_1` initializes the dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` to store the number of valid configurations for a given number of rows (or columns). The base cases are correctly set as `dp[1] = 1` (one way to place a rook in a 1x1 grid) and `dp[2] = 3` (three ways to place rooks in a 2x2 grid without attacking each other).

2. **DP Transition**: The transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is correct. This formula accounts for the following:
   - Placing a rook in the i-th row and i-th column, which leaves `dp[i-1]` configurations for the remaining (i-1)x(i-1) grid.
   - Placing a rook in the i-th row and any of the (i-1) columns, and then placing a rook in the corresponding column and any of the (i-1) rows, which leaves `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]` configurations for the remaining (i-2)x(i-2) grid.

3. **Input Handling**: The main loop reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.

4. **Invalid Positions**: The set `invalid` is used to keep track of the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks due to the initial moves. This ensures that these positions are not considered for further placements.

5. **Final Configuration Calculation**: The number of valid configurations for the remaining rows and columns (after accounting for the initial moves) is calculated using `dp[n - len(invalid)]`. This is correct because the DP array `dp` stores the number of valid configurations for a given number of rows (or columns).

6. **Edge Case Handling**: The `max(1, ...)` ensures that if there are no remaining rows or columns to place rooks, the result is 1 (since an empty board is also a valid configuration).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
