To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of `s` is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5.
- `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the string `s`.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for char in s:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
- For the loop to execute, the string `s` must contain at least one character.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only object in the loop head is `char`, which is derived from the string `s`.
- To ensure the loop executes, `s` must have at least one character.

### Final State:
- `s` must have at least one character.
- `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the string `s`.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 1, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the string `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`**
