Postcondition: **`j` will be equal to `n`, `i` will be 0, `idx_B` will contain the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` will contain the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty lists. `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of the string `s` is not '>'. Additionally, `l` is greater than `r`.**
