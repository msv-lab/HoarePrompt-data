The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`. The loop can execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0, but it will be decremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. The throwaway variable `_` does not retain any specific value between iterations.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the input.** 

However, to be more precise about the state at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is greater than 0 (but will be decremented by 1), `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the input.**
