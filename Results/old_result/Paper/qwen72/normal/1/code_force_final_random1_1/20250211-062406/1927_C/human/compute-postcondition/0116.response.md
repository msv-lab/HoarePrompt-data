Output State: **`t` is an integer where 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 + 1, `n` is the first input integer greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer greater than 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0. The loop has completed all iterations, and the values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` reflect the counts of elements that meet the conditions specified in the loop. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, the condition is met. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.** 

The code snippet `newk = k // 2` does not change the value of `newk` because it is already defined in the initial state as `k // 2`. Therefore, all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
