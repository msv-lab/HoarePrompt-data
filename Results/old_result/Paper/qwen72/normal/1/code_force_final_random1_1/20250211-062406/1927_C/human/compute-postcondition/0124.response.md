Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 3 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 + 1, `n` is the first input integer greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer greater than 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, and `i` (which is 1) is present in both lists `a` and `b`. If `aOnes` < `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 1, and `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`.***
