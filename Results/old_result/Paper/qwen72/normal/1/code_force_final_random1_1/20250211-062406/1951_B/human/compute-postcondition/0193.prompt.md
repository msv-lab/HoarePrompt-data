Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a list of integers with its first element (`s[0]`) and the element at index `k-1` swapped back to their original positions, `i` is the last element checked in `s` (or `s[-1]` if the loop completes without breaking), `j` is the index of the last element checked in `s` (or `len(s) - 2` if the loop completes without breaking), `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` and meet the condition `h >= i` before encountering an element greater than `h`, `p` is equal to `j`, `ans1` is 0, `z` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the last element checked in `s` (or `s[-1]` if the loop completes without breaking), `j` is the index of the last element checked in `s` (or `len(s) - 2` if the loop completes without breaking), `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` and meet the condition `h >= i` before encountering an element greater than `h`, `p` is equal to `j`, `z` is 1, and `ans1` is 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h` or if `z` was 1, otherwise `ans1` remains 0. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 0. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `z` was 1, otherwise `ans1` remains 0. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, the loop continues or the next statement is executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the next element in `s` after the last element checked, `j` is the index of the next element in `s` (or `len(s) - 1` if the loop completes without breaking), `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` and meet the condition `h >= i` before encountering an element greater than `h`, `p` is equal to `j`, `z` is 1, and `ans1` is 2 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` or if `z` was 1. If `i == h`, `ans1` is 2 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`. If `i > h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans1` remains 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h` or if `z` was 1, otherwise `ans1` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the next element in `s` after the last element checked, `j` is the index of the next element in `s` (or `len(s) - 1` if the loop completes without breaking), `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` and meet the condition `h >= i` before encountering an element greater than `h`, `p` is equal to `j`, and `z` is 1. If `i == h`, `ans1` is 3 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` or if `z` was 1, otherwise `ans1` is 2 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` or if `z` was 1, otherwise `ans1` remains 0. If `i > h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans1` remains 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h` or if `z` was 1, otherwise `ans1` remains 0. If `i < h`, `ans1` is 3 if `z` is 1 and `s[0]` is not equal to `h`. If `z` is not 1, `ans1` is 2 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` or if `z` was 1, otherwise `ans1` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
