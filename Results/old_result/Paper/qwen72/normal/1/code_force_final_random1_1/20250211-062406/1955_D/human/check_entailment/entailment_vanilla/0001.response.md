### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function initializes a list `cnt_b` to keep track of the frequency of elements in array `b`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Frequency Counting for Array `b`:**
   - The function updates the `cnt_b` list to count the occurrences of each element in `b`.

3. **Initial Subsegment Check:**
   - The function initializes `curr` to count the number of matching elements in the first subsegment of length `m` from array `a`.
   - It decrements the count in `cnt_b` for each element in this subsegment and increments `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is non-negative.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The function uses a sliding window approach to check each subsequent subsegment of length `m` in array `a`.
   - For each new element added to the window, it updates `cnt_b` and `curr` accordingly.
   - For each element removed from the window, it also updates `cnt_b` and `curr` accordingly.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` after updating, it increments the answer `ans`.

5. **Resetting Counts:**
   - After processing each test case, the function resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to prepare for the next test case.

### Correctness:
- The function correctly handles the initialization and input reading.
- The frequency counting and initial subsegment check are implemented correctly.
- The sliding window approach ensures that each subsegment of length `m` is checked efficiently.
- The function correctly updates the counts and the current number of matches (`curr`).
- The final answer is printed for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
