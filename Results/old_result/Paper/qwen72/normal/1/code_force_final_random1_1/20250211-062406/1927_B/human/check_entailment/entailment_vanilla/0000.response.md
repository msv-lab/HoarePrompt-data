### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `l` and the trace array `array`.

2. **Alphabet Initialization**:
   - An alphabet list `alp` containing all lowercase Latin letters is initialized.

3. **Reversing the Array**:
   - The trace array `array` is reversed to facilitate the counting process from the end of the array.

4. **Constructing the Answer**:
   - For each element in the reversed array, the function counts how many times the current element appears in the remaining part of the array.
   - It then appends the corresponding letter from the alphabet list to the answer list `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the constructed string by joining the elements of `ans`.

### Analysis:

- **Trace Interpretation**:
  - The trace array `a` represents the number of previous occurrences of the same character up to the current position.
  - By reversing the array, the function can count the occurrences of each value from the end, which helps in determining the correct character to use.

- **Character Selection**:
  - The function uses the count of the current value in the remaining part of the reversed array to select the appropriate character from the alphabet.
  - This approach ensures that the characters are selected in the correct order based on their frequency.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles edge cases such as single-character strings and strings with all zeros in the trace array correctly.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly reconstructs a string from its trace array by reversing the array and using the count of each value to select the appropriate character. The logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
