The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` must have at least two elements, and `x` is the second element of `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least three elements, and `x` will be the third element of `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least three elements, `x` is the third element of `a`, if the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, then `cnt` is 1 + 2 * math.floor(x / 2), otherwise `cnt` is 2 * math.floor(x / 2)**
