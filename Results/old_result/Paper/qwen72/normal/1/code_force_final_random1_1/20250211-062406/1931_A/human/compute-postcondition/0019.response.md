Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `word` is 'aa' + `alphabet[n - 3]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the string `'aa'` followed by the character at index `n - 3` from the `alphabet` string to the variable `word`. Since `word` was initially an empty string, it now contains the value `'aa'` plus the character from `alphabet` at the position `n - 3`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
