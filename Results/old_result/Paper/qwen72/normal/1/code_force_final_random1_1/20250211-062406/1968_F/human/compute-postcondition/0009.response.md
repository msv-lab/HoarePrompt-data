Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros.** 

Explanation: The variable `a` is initialized as a list of length `n + 1`, where each element is set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, and `idx` remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `idx` has been increased by 2.
