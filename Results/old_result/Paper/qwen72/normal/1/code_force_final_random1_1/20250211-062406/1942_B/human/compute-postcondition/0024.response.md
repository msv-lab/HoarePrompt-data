Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None`, `mex` is now equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n` to the variable `mex`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `ar`, and `res` remain unchanged.
