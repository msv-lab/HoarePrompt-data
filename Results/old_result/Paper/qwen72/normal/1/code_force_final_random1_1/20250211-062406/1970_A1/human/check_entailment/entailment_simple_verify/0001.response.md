Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is indeed not used in the provided code, so it does not affect the correctness of the program. We can safely ignore it.
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects, which will hold the balance, position, and character for each position in the input string `s`.
   - **Loop**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, updating the balance accordingly and appending a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info`. This part correctly calculates the balance for each prefix and stores the necessary information.
   - **Sorting**: The list `balance_info` is sorted based on the balance in ascending order and, in case of ties, by the position in descending order. This sorting logic aligns with the problem statement, ensuring that the characters are rearranged according to the specified rules.
   - **Result Construction**: The sorted `balance_info` list is used to construct the result string by concatenating the characters in the new order. This step correctly forms the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.
3. **Output**: The result string is printed, which should be the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

The annotated code confirms that each step in the program is executed correctly, and the final output matches the expected behavior as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
