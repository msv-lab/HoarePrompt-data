The function `func` accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of constraints and relationships. It handles multiple test cases, each defined by the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer (k ≤ n ≤ 10^9) representing the final destination.
  - `k`: An integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) representing the number of known time points.
  - `q`: An integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5) representing the number of queries.
  - `a`: A list of `k` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1, with a_k = n) representing the positions at known time points.
  - `b`: A list of `k` integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1) representing the times at the known positions.
  - `d`: A list of `q` integers (0 ≤ d ≤ n) representing the queries.

The function returns, for each query `d` in each test case, the time it takes to reach position `d` based on the known positions and times provided in `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, and `b`. For each query `d`, it returns the time it takes to reach position `d` based on the known positions and times.**
