Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. A diagonal is defined as a set of cells where either the row index plus the column index is constant (main diagonals) or the row index minus the column index is constant (anti-diagonals).

2. **Total Diagonals**: For an \( n \times n \) grid, there are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total. This includes both main and anti-diagonals.

3. **Key Insight**: To minimize the number of colored cells while ensuring at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell, we can use the fact that each colored cell can cover up to 2 diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal).

4. **Edge Case**: If \( k \) is equal to the total number of diagonals \( 4n - 2 \), we need to color all cells in a way that covers all diagonals. In this case, the minimum number of cells required is \( k // 2 + 1 \). This is because the last diagonal will require an additional cell to be covered.

5. **General Case**: For other values of \( k \), the minimum number of cells required is \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \). This is because each cell can cover 2 diagonals, and we need to round up to ensure we cover at least \( k \) diagonals.

6. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It checks if \( k \) is equal to \( 4n - 2 \). If true, it prints \( k // 2 + 1 \).
   - Otherwise, it prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).

7. **Verification**:
   - For \( k = 4n - 2 \), the program correctly prints \( k // 2 + 1 \).
   - For other values of \( k \), the program correctly prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to handle all cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
