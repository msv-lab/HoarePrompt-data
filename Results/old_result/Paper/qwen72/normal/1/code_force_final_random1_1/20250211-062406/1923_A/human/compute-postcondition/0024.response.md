Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `arr` is the last input string with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the last `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in the last `arr`, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the last `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in the last `arr`, `z` is the substring of the last `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1` if `x` and `y` are valid and `n - y > x`, otherwise `z` is an empty string.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because it has been decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reached 0. The variables `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will reflect the state of the last iteration of the loop, where `n` is the last input integer, `arr` is the last input string with spaces removed, `x` and `y` are the indices of the first and last occurrences of '1' in `arr`, respectively, and `z` is the substring of `arr` from `x` to `n - y - 1` if `x` and `y` are valid and `n - y > x`. If `x` or `y` are not valid, `z` will be an empty string.
