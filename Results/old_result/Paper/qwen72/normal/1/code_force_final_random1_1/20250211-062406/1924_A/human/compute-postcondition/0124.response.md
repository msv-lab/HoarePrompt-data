The value of `cur` is updated by adding `1 << cur_ss` to its current value. Since `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character in `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', and the bitwise AND of `cur` and `1 << cur_ss` was 0, this means that the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` was initially 0. After the operation, the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is now 1.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the first character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is updated to include the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` set to 1.**
