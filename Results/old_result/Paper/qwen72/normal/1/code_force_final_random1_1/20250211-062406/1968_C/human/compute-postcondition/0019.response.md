Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to all zeros except `a[0]` which is 1000, `a[1]` is now `1000 + x[0]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The code `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` updates the value of `a[1]` (since `i` is 1).
- Initially, `a[0]` is 1000 and `a[1]` is 0.
- The value of `a[1]` is updated to `a[0] + x[0]`, which is `1000 + x[0]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
