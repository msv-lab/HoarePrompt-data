Output State: **After the loop has executed all its iterations, `lst` contains indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50. `ele` remains undefined, `mini` remains 100000000, `final` remains an empty list or contains either 0 or `n` based on `c1`, `t` remains greater than 0, `n` remains the same, `s` remains the input string, `pk` remains `n / 2`, `sl` remains a list containing the characters of `s`, `o` remains the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` remains the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the total count of '0' characters in `s` up to index `n - 2`, `one` is the total count of '1' characters in `s` up to index `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, and `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.**

In natural language, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The list `lst` contains the indices (1-based) where the percentage of zeros up to that index and the percentage of ones from that index to the end of the string are both at least 50%.
- The variable `ele` remains undefined because it is never set within the loop.
- The variable `mini` remains at its initial value of 100000000.
- The list `final` remains as it was initially, either empty or containing 0 or `n` based on the value of `c1`.
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0, indicating that the loop condition is still met.
- The variable `n` remains the same as it was initially.
- The string `s` remains the same as it was initially.
- The variable `pk` remains `n / 2`.
- The list `sl` remains a list of characters from `s`.
- The variable `o` remains the count of '1' characters in `s`.
- The variable `z` remains the count of '0' characters in `s`.
- The variable `i` is `n - 2`, indicating the last iteration of the loop.
- The variable `zero` is the total count of '0' characters in `s` up to the second-to-last character.
- The variable `one` is the total count of '1' characters in `s` up to the second-to-last character.
- The variable `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0' characters up to the second-to-last character.
- The variable `one_perc` is the percentage of '1' characters from the second-to-last character to the end of the string.
