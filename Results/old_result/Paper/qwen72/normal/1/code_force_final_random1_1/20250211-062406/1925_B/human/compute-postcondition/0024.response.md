Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, and `ans` is the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` for which the conditions `x % i == 0`, `x - n * i >= 0`, `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, `x - n * (x // i) >= 0`, `x // i > 0`, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` are all satisfied.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
- For each `i`, the loop checks if `x` is divisible by `i` (`x % i == 0`).
- If `x` is divisible by `i`, it further checks two conditions:
  1. If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i` without a remainder, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`.
  2. If `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` without a remainder, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x // i`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, and `ans` will hold the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` that satisfies the conditions mentioned above.
