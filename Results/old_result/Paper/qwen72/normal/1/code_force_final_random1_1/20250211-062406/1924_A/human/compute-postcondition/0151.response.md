Postcondition: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met, and `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that were added when `cur` was reset to 0. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged. Additionally, `cnt` is less than `n`.**
