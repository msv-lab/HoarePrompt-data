The code `set_ = list(set(arr))` creates a new list `set_` containing the unique elements from the list `arr`. Since `arr` is a list of positive integers and its first element is 1, the new list `set_` will contain the unique positive integers from `arr`, including 1. The length of `set_` will be less than or equal to the length of `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is at least 1 and does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `A` is False; `set_` is a list of unique positive integers from `arr`, including 1.**
