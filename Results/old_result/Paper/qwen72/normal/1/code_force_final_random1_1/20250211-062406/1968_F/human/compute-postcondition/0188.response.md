Output State: **`mp` is updated to `{(0): [0], pf[1]: [1], pf[2]: [2]}`, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a[1]` is set to `int(data[idx-3])`, `idx` is incremented by 1 (so `idx` is now `idx + 1`), `pf[1]` is set to `pf[0] ^ a[1]`, `a[2]` is set to `int(data[idx-2])`, `pf[2]` is set to `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `a[3]` is set to `int(data[idx])`, and all other variables (`t`, `q`, `data`, `a`, `pf`, `results`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`) remain unchanged.**
