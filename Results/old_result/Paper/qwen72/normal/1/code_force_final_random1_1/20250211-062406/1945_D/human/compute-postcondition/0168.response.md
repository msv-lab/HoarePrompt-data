The value of `custo` is updated by adding the value of `a_values[y]` to it. Since the initial value of `custo` was 0, the new value of `custo` will be the value of `a_values[y]`.

Output State: **`custo` is now the value of `a_values[y]`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf` and must be greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `b_values` now includes the integer values of all elements in `b`, `nf` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the user input split by spaces, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x` remain unchanged, `a_values` now includes the integer values of all elements in `a`, and the current value of `a_values[y]` is less than the current value of `b_values[y]`.**
