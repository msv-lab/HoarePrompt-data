#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is a tuple (n, m) with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 and m being a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and the second element is a string a consisting of n characters from 'A' to 'G'.

    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` remains the same as it was initially, `_` has reached the value `t-1` (the last index of the `test_cases` list), `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the `missing` value calculated for each test case. The variables `n`, `m`, and `a` hold the values from the last tuple in `test_cases`, and `freq` is a list of 7 integers representing the frequency of characters 'A' to 'G' in the last `a`.

    #The program returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is the `missing` value calculated for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case is a tuple containing a tuple `(n, m)` and a string `a` of length `n` with characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case to ensure that there are at least `m` problems of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). It returns a list `results` with `t` elements, where each element represents the number of additional problems required for the corresponding test case. The input parameters `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged after the function execution.
