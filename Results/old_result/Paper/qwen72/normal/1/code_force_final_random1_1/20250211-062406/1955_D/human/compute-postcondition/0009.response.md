The code snippet `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt_b` at the index `b[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is 1, the value of `cnt_b` at the index `b[1]` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1.**
