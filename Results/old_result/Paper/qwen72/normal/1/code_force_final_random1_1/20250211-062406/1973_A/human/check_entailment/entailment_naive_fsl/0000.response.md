Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in how it calculates the maximum number of draws. Specifically, the formula used to calculate `egalites` is incorrect:

```python
egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
```

This formula does not correctly account for the distribution of points in a way that maximizes the number of draws. 

### Counterexample:
Consider the input `(0, 2, 3)`:
- According to the problem, the total points are `0 + 2 + 3 = 5`. Since the total points must be even for a valid set of games, this input should result in `-1`.
- However, the program incorrectly calculates `total_matchs` as `5 // 2 = 2`, and then proceeds to calculate `egalites` as `5 - 2 * (3 - 2) - 2 * (3 - 0) = 5 - 2 - 6 = -3`, which is less than 0, so it returns `-1`.

While the program correctly identifies that the input is invalid, it does so for the wrong reason. The issue is that the formula for `egalites` is flawed and does not correctly handle all cases.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that the total points are even and that the points can be distributed in a way that maximizes the number of draws. A correct approach would involve checking if the total points are even and then calculating the maximum number of draws based on the distribution of points.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it uses a flawed formula to calculate the number of draws, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
