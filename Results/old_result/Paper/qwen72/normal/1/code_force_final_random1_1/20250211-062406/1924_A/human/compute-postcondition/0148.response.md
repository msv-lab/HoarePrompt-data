Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met, and `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that were added when `cur` was reset to 0. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `cur` is reset to 0 every time it reaches `(1 << k) - 1`.
- `cnt` increments each time `cur` is reset to 0.
- `ans` accumulates characters from `s` each time `cur` is reset to 0.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` are not modified within the loop and thus remain unchanged.
