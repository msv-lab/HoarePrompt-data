Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.** 

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to an integer input provided by the user, which must be between 1 and 500. The variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
