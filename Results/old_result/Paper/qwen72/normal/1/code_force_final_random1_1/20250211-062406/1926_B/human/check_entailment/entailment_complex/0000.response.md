Reasoning:

The program aims to determine whether a given grid represents a square or a triangle based on the pattern of '1's. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis of the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`a`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid (`n`) and the grid itself.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The program collects the count of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' into a list `k`.
   - It then checks if the first two elements of `k` are equal. If they are, it prints "SQUARE"; otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Square Detection**: For a square, every row should have the same number of '1's. The program checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a square. However, since the problem guarantees that the grid contains exactly one shape (either a square or a triangle), this check is sufficient.
   - **Triangle Detection**: For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should follow the pattern \(2i - 1\) for the i-th row. The program checks if the first two rows do not have the same number of '1's, which is a necessary condition for a triangle. Again, since the problem guarantees that the grid contains exactly one shape, this check is sufficient.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints well, as it ensures that the grid size is between 2 and 10, and the number of test cases is between 1 and 100.
   - The program correctly handles the input format and the conditions for determining the shape.

Given the problem constraints and the guarantees provided, the program is logically sound and will correctly identify the shape in the grid.

Correctness: **True**
