Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `test_cases` must be greater than `n`.
3. `i` is `n-1`.
4. `feat` is a list of integers read from input.
5. `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 0.
6. `f` is the second element of `feat`.
7. `a` is the third element of `feat`.
8. `b` is the last element of `feat`.
9. `arr` is a list of integers read from the new input.
10. `array2` is a list containing the results of \((arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a\) for all \(j\) in the range \([1, n-1]\) where the condition \((arr[j] - arr[j-1]) < b / a\) is true.
11. The sum of `array2` plus \((n - \text{len}(array2)) * b\) is greater than or equal to `f`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and conditions, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement will always print `'No'` regardless of the values of the variables and conditions described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
