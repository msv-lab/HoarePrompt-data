Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `i` is 2. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the conditions for `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain as described in the initial state, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
