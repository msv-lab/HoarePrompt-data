Reasoning:  
The provided solution aims to solve the problem by always adding the largest element in the list (`nums[-1]`) to the second largest element in the list (`max(nums[:-1])`). However, this approach is flawed because it assumes that the last element in the list is always the largest, which is not necessarily true. The correct approach should involve finding the two largest elements in the list, regardless of their positions, and summing them up.

To illustrate why the current implementation is incorrect, consider the following example:
- Input: `4\n2 3 3 1`
- Expected Output: `6` (since the two largest numbers are 3 and 3)
- Actual Output: `4` (since the code incorrectly sums `3` and `1`)

The correct approach would be to sort the list and take the sum of the two largest elements, or use a more efficient method to find the two largest elements without sorting the entire list.

Correctness: **False**
