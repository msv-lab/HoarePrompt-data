Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each element a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to `a[k]`; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 0. If `a[i]` > `x`, `ind` is a list containing the index `i` (which is 1) and `c` is 2. Otherwise, `ind` is an empty list and `c` is 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
