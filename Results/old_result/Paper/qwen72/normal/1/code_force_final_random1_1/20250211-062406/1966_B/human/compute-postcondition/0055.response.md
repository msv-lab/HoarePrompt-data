Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1), `m` is the new input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is `False`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`tc`**: Remains 1, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains the new input integer (greater than 1), as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`m`**: Remains the new input integer, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`gr`**: Initially an empty list, it now contains `n` input strings, each added during one iteration of the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1`, as the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`.
- **`ans`**: Remains 'NO', as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`impossible`**: Remains `False`, as it is not modified within the loop.
