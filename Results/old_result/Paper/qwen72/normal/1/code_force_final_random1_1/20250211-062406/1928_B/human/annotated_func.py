#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value entered by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value entered by the user. After the function concludes, the program has returned an integer value that was provided by the user through the input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters and is used to read input from the user, converting it into a list of integers.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts each element from the user's input (which is split by spaces) into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input by spaces, converts each resulting string into an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. After the function concludes, the program has a map object that can be iterated over to access the converted integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters and is designed to read input from stdin, typically in the context of a larger program where input format and constraints are predefined.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string (read from stdin) and converting each part into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from standard input (stdin), splits the input string into parts based on whitespace, converts each part into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function does not accept any parameters. After the function concludes, the program has a list of integers derived from the input string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters. It reads input from stdin, expecting a line of space-separated integers.
def func_4():
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers read from the input, where the input was a line of space-separated integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input and returns a sorted list of these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters and is used to read input from the user, splitting it into a map of strings.
def func_5():
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing strings, which are the split parts of the input provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into parts based on whitespace, and returns a map object containing these parts as strings. The function does not take any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the caller will have a map object that can be iterated over to access the split parts of the input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function `func_6` does not take any parameters.
def func_6():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list containing each character from the input string as individual elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It reads a string from the user input and returns a list where each element is a character from the input string. After the function concludes, the program has a list of characters, and no other variables are affected.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function `func_7` does not take any parameters.
def func_7():
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of strings, where each string is an element from the input provided by the user, split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to a string, sorts the resulting list of strings, and returns this sorted list. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has a sorted list of strings derived from the user's input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers.
def func_8(arr):
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of positive integers with any number of elements (as it was initially), `ans` is a list where each element is the cumulative product of the elements in `arr` up to that index, `tem` is equal to the product of all elements in `arr`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is a list where each element is the cumulative product of the elements in `arr` up to that index.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a list of positive integers `arr` and returns a new list `ans`. Each element in `ans` represents the cumulative product of the elements in `arr` up to the corresponding index. After the function concludes, `arr` remains unchanged, and `ans` contains the cumulative products.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_9(arr):
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `arr` remains unchanged as a list of integers, `ans` contains the cumulative products of the elements of `arr` starting from the last element to the first, and `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`. The variable `i` is -1, indicating that the loop has completed its execution.
    return ans
    #The program returns the list `ans` which contains the cumulative products of the elements of `arr` starting from the last element to the first.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a new list `ans` containing the cumulative products of the elements of `arr`, starting from the last element to the first. The original list `arr` remains unchanged.
