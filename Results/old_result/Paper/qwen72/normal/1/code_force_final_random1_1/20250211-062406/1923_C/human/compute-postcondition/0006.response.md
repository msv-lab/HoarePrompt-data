To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for x in l:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop iterates over the elements of the list `l`. For the loop to execute, `l` must contain at least one element. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which is derived from the elements of the list `l`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `l` contains at least one element.
3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since `l` must have at least one element for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `l` is not empty.

### Adjusted State:
- `l` must be a list of integers that contains at least one element.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `p`, `c`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged as they are not directly involved in the loop head.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1, `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())`, `l` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `p` is a list containing a single element `[0]`, `c` is a list containing a single element `[0]`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
