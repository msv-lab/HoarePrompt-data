The code snippet assigns the values from `input().split()` to `n` and `k` using the `map` function to convert them to integers. The initial values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the user input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list of integers with all its elements processed, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, `pow` is \(2^{\text{length of } L}\)**
