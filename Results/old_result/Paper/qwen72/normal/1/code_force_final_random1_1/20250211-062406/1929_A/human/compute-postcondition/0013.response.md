The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `ntest` is equal to `t`
- `itest` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input
- `ntest` must be greater than 2

After executing the code snippet, the variable `a` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `ntest` is equal to `t`, `itest` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `ntest` must be greater than 2.**
