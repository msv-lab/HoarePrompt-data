Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in `arr', `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in `arr', `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1` if `x` and `y` are valid and `n - y > x`, otherwise `z` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer provided by the user.
- The values of `t`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
