Postcondition: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string, and the loop will continue to execute as long as the current value of `_` is less than the value of `t`. If the first element of `b` is odd and the second element is not two more than the first, or if the last element of `b` is odd and the second-to-last element is not two more than the last, the if part's conditions hold. Otherwise, the else part's conditions hold.**
