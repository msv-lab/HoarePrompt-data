You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        ans.append(p)
    return reversed(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters). It returns a list of `n` integers, where each integer is the cumulative product of the elements in a reordered list `b` from the last to the current index, taken modulo `m`. The list `b` is constructed by rearranging the elements of `a` based on the characters in `s`: if `s[i]` is 'L', the element from the start of `a` is added to `b`; if `s[i]` is 'R', the element from the end of `a` is added to `b`. The final list is reversed before being returned.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it works for every potential case:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Processing Commands**:
   - The function `func_1` processes the commands in the string `s`.
   - It maintains two pointers `l` and `r` to track the leftmost and rightmost indices of the array `a`.
   - For each command in `s`, it appends the appropriate element to the list `b` and updates the pointers accordingly.

3. **Calculating the Product Modulo**:
   - After processing all commands, the program calculates the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` modulo `m` for each step.
   - It uses a running product `p` to keep track of the product modulo `m` and appends the result to the list `ans`.

4. **Reversing the Results**:
   - The results are stored in reverse order due to the way the elements are processed, so the final result is reversed before returning.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case as required.

The program handles all edge cases, including:
- When `n` is 1.
- When all commands are 'L' or 'R'.
- When the product of the elements is large and needs to be taken modulo `m`.

Since the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases, it is considered correct.
