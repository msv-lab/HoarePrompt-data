The only object in the loop head is the variable `ss` and the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the second character in `s`, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character in `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `s` needs to be considered.

At the start of the next iteration, `ss` will be the third character in `s` (assuming `s` has at least three characters). The state of `s` remains unchanged as it is the iterable being looped over.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the third character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character in `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1, `cur` is reset to 0, and `ans` includes the third character in `s`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**
