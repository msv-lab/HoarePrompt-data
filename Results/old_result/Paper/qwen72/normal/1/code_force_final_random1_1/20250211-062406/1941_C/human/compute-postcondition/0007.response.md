Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer where 1 ≤ a, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a = int(input())` updates the value of `a` to a new input integer. The initial state specifies that `a` is an input integer where 1 ≤ a, which remains true after the code execution. All other variables (`t`, `_`, `s`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.
