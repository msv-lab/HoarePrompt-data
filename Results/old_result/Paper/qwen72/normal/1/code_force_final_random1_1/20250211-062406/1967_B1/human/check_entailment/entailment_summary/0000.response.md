### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to \(n\).
   - It enters a loop that runs from 2 to \(m\):
     - For each `count`, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1`.
     - It computes `g` as the integer division of \(n\) by `count`.
     - If `g` is less than `countmins`, it breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it updates `g` by subtracting `countmins` and then adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{g}{\text{count}} \right\rfloor + 1\) to `ans`.
     - It increments `count` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Algorithm Validation**:
   - The algorithm seems to be attempting to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) by iterating over possible values of \(b\) and adjusting `ans` accordingly.
   - However, the logic inside the loop is not clearly aligned with the problem statement. Specifically, the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not directly checked or derived from the given operations.
   - The loop and the way `ans` is updated do not seem to correctly reflect the required condition.

4. **Test Case Verification**:
   - The provided test cases and their expected outputs suggest that the program should correctly count the valid pairs.
   - However, the current implementation does not match the expected logic for counting valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as per the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
