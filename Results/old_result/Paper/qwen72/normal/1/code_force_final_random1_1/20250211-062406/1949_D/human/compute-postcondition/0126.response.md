Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `nx` is the character at position `[i][j - 1]` in the array `xx`, `j` is 1, and the character at position `[i][j - 1]` in the array `xx` is not equal to '?'**. 

Explanation: The code appends the character at position `[i][j - 1]` in the array `xx` to the string `nx`. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, the character at position `[1][0]` in `xx` is appended to `nx`. The other variables remain unchanged.
