The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the context, it appears to process a series of test cases where each test case includes the parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. The parameters are constrained as follows: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The list of `x` distinct integers represents vertices chosen by Bessie, and each integer in the list is between 1 and n.

The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the given parameters and the list of vertices.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing vertices chosen by Bessie. For each test case, it returns a result based on these parameters and the list of vertices.**
