Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `t`, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers derived from the user's input, and `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. For each iteration, if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is equal to 1, then the conditions for divisibility and non-unity of `a` and `b` are met. Otherwise, either `m` is not divisible by `a`, or `m` is not divisible by `b`, or `a` is 1, or `b` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided by the user.
- After the loop completes all its iterations, the loop variable `i` will be equal to `t`.
- For each iteration, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are read from the user's input, and `mn` is calculated as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.
- The conditions inside the loop check if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and if neither `a` nor `b` is 1. Depending on these conditions, the appropriate output is printed.
- The final state after all iterations is that `i` has reached `t`, and all the conditions and calculations for each test case have been performed as specified.
