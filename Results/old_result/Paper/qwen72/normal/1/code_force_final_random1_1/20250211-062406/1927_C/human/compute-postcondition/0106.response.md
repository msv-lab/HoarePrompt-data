Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `b` is a new list of integers input by the user.
- `newk` is `k // 2`.
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b` and were counted up to `newk`.
- `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are also in `a` and were counted up to `newk`.
- The loop has completed all iterations, and the values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` reflect the counts of elements that meet the conditions specified in the loop.
- Additionally, `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement will execute after the loop has completed, and it will print the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
