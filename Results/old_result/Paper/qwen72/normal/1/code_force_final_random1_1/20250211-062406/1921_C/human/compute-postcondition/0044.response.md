Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 0, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the new input, `array2` is a list containing the results of `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for all `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` where the condition `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) < b / a` is true. The sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`.**
