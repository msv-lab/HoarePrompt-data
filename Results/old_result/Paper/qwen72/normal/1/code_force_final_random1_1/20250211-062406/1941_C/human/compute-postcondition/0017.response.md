To determine what will be printed by the `print(x + y)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `a` is an input integer where \(1 \leq a\).
   - `s` is a new input string.
   - `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new string `s`.
   - `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new string `s`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(x + y)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `x` counts the occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`.
   - The variable `y` counts the occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`.
   - The `print(x + y)` statement will output the sum of these two counts.

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `x` and `y`. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **x + y (where x is the number of times 'map' appears in the string s, and y is the number of times 'pie' appears in the string s)**
