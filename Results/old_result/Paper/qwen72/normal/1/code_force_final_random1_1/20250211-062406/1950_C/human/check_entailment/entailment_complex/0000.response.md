Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading a time string `s` in the format "hh:mm".

2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - If the hour is `00`, it correctly converts it to `12` for the 12-hour format.
   - If the hour is between `01` and `12`, it keeps the hour as is.
   - If the hour is between `13` and `23`, it subtracts `12` from the hour to convert it to the 12-hour format.

3. **AM/PM Determination**:
   - The function correctly appends "AM" if the hour is less than `12`.
   - The function correctly appends "PM" if the hour is `12` or greater.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The function prints the time in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" as required.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as `00:00` (which should be `12:00 AM`), `12:00` (which should be `12:00 PM`), and `23:59` (which should be `11:59 PM`) correctly.

6. **Loop Completion**:
   - The function correctly iterates `t` times, processing each test case as expected.

Based on the above reasoning, the function appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly and produces the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
