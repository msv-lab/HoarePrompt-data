The code snippet `count_num += 1` increments the value of `count_num` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `i` (the third element in `num`) is within the range defined by `start` and `end` (inclusive), the condition for incrementing `count_num` is met. Therefore, `count_num` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`num` must contain at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `num`, `i` is between `start` and `end` (inclusive), `count_num` is increased by 1.**
