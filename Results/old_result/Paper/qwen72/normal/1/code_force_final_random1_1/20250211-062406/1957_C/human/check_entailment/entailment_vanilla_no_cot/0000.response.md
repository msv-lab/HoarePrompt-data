Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The `func_1` function initializes the dynamic programming array `dp` which stores the number of ways to place rooks on an \(n \times n\) board without any initial invalid positions. The base cases are correctly initialized (`dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`), and the recurrence relation is correctly implemented:
   \[
   dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \cdot (i - 1) \cdot dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007
   \]
   This recurrence relation accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on a board of size \(i\).

2. **Handling Test Cases**: The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually. For each test case, it reads the board size \(n\) and the number of initial moves \(k\).

3. **Tracking Invalid Positions**: The program uses a set `invalid` to keep track of the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks. This ensures that these positions are not considered for further rook placements.

4. **Calculating Final Configurations**: After reading the initial moves, the program calculates the number of valid configurations by subtracting the number of invalid positions from \(n\) and looking up the result in the `dp` array. The `max(1, ...)` ensures that if there are no valid positions left, the result is 1 (since there is exactly one way to place no more rooks).

5. **Modulo Operation**: The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) as required by the problem statement.

Given this analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
