The code snippet updates the value of `d2[i]` using the formula `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `i` is `n - 4`.
   - `n` must be at least 4.
   - `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
   - `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1.
   - `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The value of `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.

3. **Impact:**
   - The value of `d2[i]` changes to the result of the expression `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

4. **Output State Calculation:**
   - `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `i` remains `n - 4`.
   - `n` remains at least 4.
   - `l` remains a list of integers provided by the user input.
   - `d1` remains a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1.
   - `d2` remains a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1.
   - `d2[i]` is now `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 4`, `n` is at least 4, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.**
