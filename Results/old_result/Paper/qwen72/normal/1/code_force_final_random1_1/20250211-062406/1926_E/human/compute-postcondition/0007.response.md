The value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. This value is then appended to the list `L`. The value of `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` and `k` are input integers, `n` must be non-zero, `L` is [m], `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`.**
