The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, `j` is 3. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'F', then `a[1]` is incremented by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', then `b[1]` and `b[2]` are each incremented by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', then neither `a[1]` nor `b[1]` nor `b[2]` is incremented.**
