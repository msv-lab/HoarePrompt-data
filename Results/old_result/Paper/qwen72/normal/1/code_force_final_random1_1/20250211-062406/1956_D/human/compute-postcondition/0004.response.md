To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop head is `for (l, r) in ops:`. This means the loop will iterate over each tuple `(l, r)` in the list `ops`.

2. **Initial State**: 
   - No variables are passed to the function `func_3`.
   - Inside `func_3`, `n` is an integer read from input, representing the length of the array `a`.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from input, split by spaces.
   - `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by the function `func_2(a)`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `ops` must be a non-empty list. If `ops` is empty, the loop will not run.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is `ops`.
   - To ensure the loop executes, `ops` must contain at least one tuple `(l, r)`.

Given this analysis, the state must be adjusted to ensure that `ops` is not empty. Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the values returned by `func_2(a)`, and `ops` must be a non-empty list of tuples**.
