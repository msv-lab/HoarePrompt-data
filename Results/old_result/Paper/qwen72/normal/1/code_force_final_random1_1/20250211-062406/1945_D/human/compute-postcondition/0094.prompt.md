Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `pos_final` is decreased by 1, `total` is 0, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `v`, `best` is 1000000000000, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`pos_final` is decreased by 1, `total` is either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, depending on which is smaller. `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `v` is `na_frente`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, and if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `best` remains 1000000000000.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`pos_final` is decreased by 1, `total` is updated to the smaller of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, and if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, if `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is updated to the sum of the original `total` and the smaller of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `best` is greater than the new `total`, then `best` is updated to the new `total`. In all other cases, `best` remains 1000000000000.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`pos_final` is decreased by 1, `total` is updated to the smaller of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` plus the chosen cost (either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on which is smaller), `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` and `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is updated to the sum of the original `total` and the smaller of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `best` is greater than the new `total`, then `best` is updated to the new `total`. In all other cases, `best` remains 1000000000000.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
