You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both n and m are odd.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, stdin.readline().strip().split())
    grid = []
    elements = {'.B': (-1, -1)}
    allPlayers = {}
    goal = [[], []]
    points = [0, 0]
    for i in range(n):
        line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
        
        grid.append(line)
        
        for ind in range(len(line)):
            if line[ind] != '..':
                elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
                if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                    allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
                elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
                    tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
                    goal[tmp].append((i, ind))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` and `m` remain integers read from input and satisfy the conditions 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both `n` and `m` are odd. `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, where each element is a list of strings read from the input, representing the rows of the grid. `elements` is a dictionary that contains entries for each unique non-'..' string in the entire grid, with the key being the string and the value being a tuple (i, ind) where `i` is the row index and `ind` is the column index of the string in the grid. `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains entries for each player string (as determined by the `isPlayer` function) found in the grid, with the key being the player string and the value being `False`. `goal` is a list containing two lists: the first list contains tuples (i, ind) for each string in the grid that ends with 'G' and starts with 'B', and the second list contains tuples (i, ind) for each string in the grid that ends with 'G' and starts with 'R'. `points` remains a list `[0, 0]`. `i` is `n-1`. `line` is the last list of strings read from the input and has `m` elements. `ind` is `m-1`. If `line[ind]` is not '..': `elements` includes an entry for `line[ind]` which is `(n-1, m-1)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. Otherwise, if `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(n-1, m-1)`. If `line[ind]` is '..': no changes are made to any variables.

                allPlayers[obj] = False
                if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                    team = goalIn(pos)

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is 0, `time` is `t-1`, `command` is the last list of strings read from standard input during the final iteration. The values of `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `mov`, `grid`, and `player` may have changed based on the commands processed during the loop. Specifically, `allPlayers` may have some keys set to `True` if the command was `.Q`, `points` may have been incremented by 10 for the respective team if the command was `.S`, and positions of players and the ball (`.B`) may have been updated based on movement commands. Any eliminations or goals scored will have been printed to the console.
    print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
    #This is printed: FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where [points[0]] and [points[1]] are the final scores for the two teams after all commands have been processed)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters but uses two internal integers, `n` and `m`, which are both odd and within the range of 3 to 99. The specific return value of the function is not specified.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
