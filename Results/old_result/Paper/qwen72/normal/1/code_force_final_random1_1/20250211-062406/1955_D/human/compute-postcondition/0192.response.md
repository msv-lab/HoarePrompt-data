Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 2 if `a[0]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[0]]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `cnt_b[a[1]]` is greater than or equal to 0; otherwise, `curr` is 1 if `a[0]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[0]]` is greater than or equal to 0. `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decremented by 1, `n` remains an input integer, `k` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers read from the input, and `b` remains a list of integers read from the input.***
