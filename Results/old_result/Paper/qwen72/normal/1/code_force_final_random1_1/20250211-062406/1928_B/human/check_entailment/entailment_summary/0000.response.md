### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal in an array `a` after adding a permutation `p` to it.
   - The permutation `p` is a sequence of distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code uses a loop to handle multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array itself.
   - It then sorts the unique elements of the array and uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal.

3. **Function Breakdown:**
   - **`func_1`**: Reads an integer from input, which is used to determine the number of test cases.
   - **`func_3`**: Reads a line of space-separated integers and returns them as a list.
   - **Main Logic**:
     - The main logic sorts the unique elements of the array.
     - It then iterates over these unique elements and uses `bisect_left` to find the position where the current element plus `n` would fit in the sorted list.
     - The difference between this position and the current index gives the count of elements that can be made equal.
     - The maximum of these counts is stored in `ans` and printed for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic correctly identifies the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation.
   - The use of `sorted(list(set(arr)))` ensures that we are working with unique elements, which is necessary for the binary search to work correctly.
   - The `bisect_left` function is used appropriately to find the position in the sorted list, which helps in calculating the count of elements that can be made equal.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
