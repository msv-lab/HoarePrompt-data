The code snippet `b = b - A[l - r - 1]` updates the value of `b` by subtracting the value of `A[l - r - 1]` from the current value of `b`.

Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `j` is equal to `n`
   - `i` is 2
   - `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order
   - `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop
   - `l` is 0
   - `r` is the length of `B` minus 1
   - `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`
   - `b` is `A[l - 1]`

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The expression `l - r - 1` calculates the index used to access `A`.
   - The value of `b` is updated to `b - A[l - r - 1]`.

3. **Calculations:**
   - `l` is 0
   - `r` is the length of `B` minus 1
   - `l - r - 1` simplifies to `0 - (length of B - 1) - 1`, which is `-length of B`
   - `A[-length of B]` accesses the last element of `A` (since negative indexing in Python starts from the end of the list).

4. **Updated Value of `b`:**
   - `b` is initially `A[l - 1]`, which is `A[-1]` (the last element of `A`).
   - The new value of `b` is `A[-1] - A[-length of B]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `j` is equal to `n`
- `i` is 2
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order
- `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop
- `l` is 0
- `r` is the length of `B` minus 1
- `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`
- `b` is `A[-1] - A[-length of B]`

Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[-1] - A[-length of B]`.**
