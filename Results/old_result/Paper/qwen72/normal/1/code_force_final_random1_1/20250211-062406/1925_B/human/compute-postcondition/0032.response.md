The code snippet assigns the maximum value between `ans` and `i` to `ans`. Given the initial state, `i` is calculated as `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, and `x` is divisible by `i` without any remainder. Additionally, `(x - n * i)` is non-negative and divisible by `i` without any remainder.

Since `i` is a positive integer and `x` is at least 1, `i` will also be at least 1. The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`x` must be at least 1, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, `x` is divisible by `i` without any remainder, `(x - n * i)` is non-negative and divisible by `i` without any remainder, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `i`.**
