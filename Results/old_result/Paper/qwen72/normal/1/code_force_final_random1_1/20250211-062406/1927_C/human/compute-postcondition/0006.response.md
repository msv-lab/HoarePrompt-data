Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`.** 

Explanation: The variable `newk` is assigned the value of `k` divided by 2 using integer division, which means `newk` will be the largest integer less than or equal to `k / 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
