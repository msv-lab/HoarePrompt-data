Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take an integer n as input, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, representing the encoded value of a three-letter word. `alphabet` is set to 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    word = ''
    if n > 52:
        word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
    elif n > 26:
        word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
    else:
        word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
    print(word)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 78 (inclusive), and `word` is a string. If `n` is between 53 and 78 (inclusive), `word` is the character from the alphabet corresponding to the position `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 27 and 52 (inclusive), `word` is 'a' + the character at position `n - 28` in the alphabet + 'z'. If `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), `word` is 'aa' followed by the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `word` is an empty string initially. If `n` > 52, `word` is the string containing the character from `alphabet[n - 53]` followed by `'zz'`. If `n` is between 27 and 52 (inclusive), `word` is set to `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. If `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), `word` is set to `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, and `word` is a string. If `n` > 52, `word` is the string formed by appending the character at index `n - 53` of `alphabet` followed by `'zz'`. If `n` is between 27 and 52 (inclusive), `word` is set to `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. If `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), `word` is set to `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
