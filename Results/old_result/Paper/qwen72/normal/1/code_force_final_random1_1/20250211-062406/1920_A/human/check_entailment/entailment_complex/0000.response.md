### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the user if `isOne` is `False`. If `isOne` is `True`, it returns 1.
   - This function is used correctly in the main program to read the number of test cases.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads a line of input and splits it based on the `space` parameter. If `to_int` is `True`, it converts the split items to integers.
   - This function is not directly used in the main program, but it could be useful for reading and processing input in a more general way.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function concatenates elements of a list with a specified separator.
   - This function is not directly used in the main program, but it could be useful for formatting output.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function finds all indices of a substring in a string.
   - This function is not directly used in the main program, but it could be useful for string manipulation tasks.

5. **Function 5 (`func_5`)**:
   - This function finds all indices of a specific element in a list.
   - This function is not directly used in the main program, but it could be useful for list manipulation tasks.

6. **Function 6 (`func_6`)**:
   - This function finds the first sublist in a list of lists where the element at a specific index matches a given value.
   - This function is not directly used in the main program, but it could be useful for searching within nested lists.

7. **Function 7 (`func_7`)**:
   - This function processes the constraints for a single test case.
   - It reads the number of constraints `n` and then processes each constraint to update the `start` and `end` values and the list `num`.
   - It correctly handles the three types of constraints:
     - Type 1: Update `start` to the maximum value encountered.
     - Type 2: Update `end` to the minimum value encountered.
     - Type 3: Append the value to the list `num`.
   - After processing all constraints, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.
   - It correctly handles the edge case where `start` is greater than `end` by returning 0.
   - It correctly subtracts the count of invalid values in `num` from the range `[start, end]`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. All functions are either used appropriately or are not necessary for the solution but do not interfere with the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**
