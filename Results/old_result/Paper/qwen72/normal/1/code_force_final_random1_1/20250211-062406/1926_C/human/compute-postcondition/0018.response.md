The code snippet `pd[i] += int(j)` updates the value of `pd[i]` by adding the integer value of `j` to it. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case
- `N` is 200001
- `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0
- `pd[i]` (where `i` is `N`) is now the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N` plus the integer value of `j`
- `i` is `N`
- `j` is '2'

The integer value of `j` is 2. Therefore, `pd[i]` is incremented by 2.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0, `pd[i]` (where `i` is `N`) is now the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N` plus the integer value of `j` plus 2, `i` is `N`, `j` is '2'**
