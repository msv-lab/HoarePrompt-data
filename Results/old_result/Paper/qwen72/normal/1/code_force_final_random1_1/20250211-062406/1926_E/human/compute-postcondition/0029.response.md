The value of `pow` is multiplied by 2. Initially, `pow` is 2, so after the multiplication, `pow` becomes 4. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `L`, `a`, `tot`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `L` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `pow` is 4, `a` is the second element in the list, `tot` is updated to `tot + a`.**
