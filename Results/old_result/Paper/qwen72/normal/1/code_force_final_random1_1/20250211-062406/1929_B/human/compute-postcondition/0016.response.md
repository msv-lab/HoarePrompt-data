Initial State: `t` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input.

Given the code snippet:
```python
print(ceil(k / 2))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `t` is greater than 1 (but not used in the print statement).
   - `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input.
   - `k` is the integer that will be used in the calculation.

2. **Calculation:**
   - The expression `k / 2` divides the integer `k` by 2.
   - The `ceil` function from the `math` module rounds the result of `k / 2` up to the nearest integer.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the ceiling of `k / 2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ceil(k / 2) (where ceil(k / 2) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k / 2)**

This means the output will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to half of `k`.
