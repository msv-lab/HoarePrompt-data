To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and its impact on the variables:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- If the first character of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is '>', then `idx_A` is a list containing `[0]`.
- If `len(idx_A) == 0`, then `A` is `[0]` and `idx_A` remains an empty list.
- Otherwise, `A` is a list containing one element `[x]`, `idx_A` is not empty, and `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 1] + (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
- If the first character of `s` is not '>', then `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged as empty lists.

### Code Snippet:
```python
x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Check the initial conditions:**
   - If `s[0]` is '>', then `idx_A` is `[0]`.
   - If `s[0]` is not '>', then `A` and `idx_A` are both empty lists.

2. **Evaluate the code snippet:**
   - If `s[0]` is '>', then `idx_A` is `[0]` and `A` is `[x]` where `x` is calculated as:
     \[
     x = A[\text{len}(A) - 1] + (i - \text{idx\_A}[\text{len}(\text{idx\_A}) - 1]) \times \text{len}(\text{idx\_A})
     \]
     Since `A` is `[x]` and `idx_A` is `[0]`, we have:
     \[
     x = x + (1 - 0) \times 1 = x + 1
     \]
     This means `x` is incremented by 1.

3. **If `s[0]` is not '>', then `A` and `idx_A` are both empty lists:**
   - The code snippet `x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` will raise an error because `A` and `idx_A` are empty, and accessing `A[len(A) - 1]` or `idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]` is not possible.

### Output State:
- If `s[0]` is '>', then `idx_A` is `[0]`, `A` is `[x]`, and `x` is incremented by 1.
- If `s[0]` is not '>', then `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged as empty lists, and the code snippet will raise an error.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **If `s[0]` is '>', then `idx_A` is `[0]`, `A` is `[x]`, and `x` is `x + 1`. If `s[0]` is not '>', then `A` and `idx_A` are empty lists, and the code snippet will raise an error.**
