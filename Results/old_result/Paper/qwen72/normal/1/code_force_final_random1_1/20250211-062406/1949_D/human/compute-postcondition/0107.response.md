The value of `i` is 3, and the code appends this value to the list `sb`.

Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 24, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the next `n` elements are the input strings corresponding to each iteration, `a` and `b` are updated based on the transitions in the input strings, `i` is 3. If `a[3] > 0` and `b[3] == 0`, `sa` now contains the value of `i` appended to its existing elements. If `b[3] > 0` and `a[3] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing `[3, 3]`. If `a[3] > 0` and `b[3] == 0`, `sa` is a list containing `[1, 3]` if `a[1]` was greater than 0 and `b[1]` was 0, otherwise `sa` is a list containing `[3]`. If `b[3]` is greater than 0 and `a[3]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing `[1, 3]`; otherwise, `sb` is a list containing `[3]`.**
