Let's break down the initial state and the logic to determine the value of `z` that will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user where \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
- `a` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `z` is initially set to \((y + 1) // 2\).

### Calculation of `z`:
1. **Initial Value of `z`:**
   - `z = (y + 1) // 2`
   - This means `z` is the integer division of \(y + 1\) by 2. For example, if `y` is 5, then `z` would be 3.

2. **Calculation of `m`:**
   - `m = 15 * z - y * 4`
   - This formula calculates `m` based on the current value of `z`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - If `m` is less than `a`, then:
     - Update `z` to \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15\)
     - Recalculate `m` as `15 * z - y * 4`
   - Ensure that the new value of `m` is still less than `a`.

### Final Value of `z`:
- If `m` is initially less than `a`, `z` will be updated to a new value.
- If `m` is not less than `a`, `z` will remain \((y + 1) // 2\).

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `y = 5`, then `z = (5 + 1) // 2 = 3`.
- Suppose `a = 10`, then `m = 15 * 3 - 5 * 4 = 45 - 20 = 25`.
- Since `25` is not less than `10`, `z` remains 3.

- Suppose `y = 5` and `x = 10`, then `z = (5 + 1) // 2 = 3`.
- Suppose `a = 50`, then `m = 15 * 3 - 5 * 4 = 45 - 20 = 25`.
- Since `25` is less than `50`, `z` is updated to:
  - `z = (5 + 1) // 2 + (10 - 25 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 3 + (9) // 15 = 3 + 0 = 3`.
  - Recalculate `m` as `15 * 3 - 5 * 4 = 45 - 20 = 25`.

### Conclusion:
- The value of `z` will either remain \((y + 1) // 2\) or be updated based on the condition, but it will always be an integer value derived from the given formulas.

### Output:
Output: **z (where z is the final value of z after the condition check, initially (y + 1) // 2 and possibly updated if m < a)**
