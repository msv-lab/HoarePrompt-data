Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must contain at least two characters, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string. If the bit corresponding to the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97 is not set in `cur`, then `cur` is updated to 1 << (ASCII value of the second character of `s` - 97). Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.***
