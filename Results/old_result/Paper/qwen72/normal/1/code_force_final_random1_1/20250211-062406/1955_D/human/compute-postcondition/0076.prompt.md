Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `i` is `m-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
            curr -= 1
    if a[i + m] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
            curr += 1
    if curr >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than `m`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `curr` is decremented by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 2; otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than `m`, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`. If `a[1]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0. If `cnt_b[a[1]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations. Otherwise, `curr` remains the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 1; otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than `m`, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`. If `a[2]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is incremented by 1. If `a[2 + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[2 + m]]` is decremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[2 + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0. If `cnt_b[a[2]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations, and `curr` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `curr` remains the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
