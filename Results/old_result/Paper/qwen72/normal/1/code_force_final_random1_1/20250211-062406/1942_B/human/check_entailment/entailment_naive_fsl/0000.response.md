Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle the case where the MEX value needs to be updated correctly. Specifically, the logic for updating `mex` is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization of `mex`**: The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the length of the permutation. This is incorrect because the MEX of an empty array is 0, not `n`.

2. **Updating `mex`**: The condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]` is always true because `mex - ar[i]` is always less than `mex`. This means `mex` is always updated to `mex - ar[i]`, which can lead to incorrect values.

3. **Handling MEX correctly**: The MEX of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the sequence. The program does not correctly maintain this property. It should keep track of the smallest missing integer as the permutation is being constructed.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will produce an incorrect permutation because it does not correctly update the MEX value.

To fix this, the program should use a set to keep track of the elements that have been used and correctly compute the MEX at each step. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        used = set()
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex + ar[i]
            used.add(res[i])
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))

func()
```

This corrected version maintains a set of used elements and updates the MEX correctly, ensuring that the permutation is constructed as required.
