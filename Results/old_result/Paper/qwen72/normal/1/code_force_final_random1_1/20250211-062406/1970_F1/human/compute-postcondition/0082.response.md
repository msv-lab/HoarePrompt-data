The code snippet `goal[tmp].append((i, ind))` appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list located at the index `tmp` in the `goal` list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are integers satisfying 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd.
- `grid` is a list containing three elements: the original `line`, the updated `line`, and the new `line` read from input.
- `elements` is a dictionary that contains entries for each unique non-'..' string in `line` including the entry for `line[ind]` with the value `(1, ind)`.
- `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains entries for each player string found in `line`.
- `goal` is a list containing tuples for specific strings in `line`.
- `points` is a list `[0, 0]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `line` is a list of strings read from the input and must have at least one element.
- `ind` is the last index of `line` (i.e., `len(line) - 1`).
- The last element of `line` (i.e., `line[ind]`) is not equal to '..' and is not a player string.
- The second character of the last element of `line` (i.e., `line[ind][1]`) is 'G'.
- `tmp` is 1.

After executing the code snippet:
- The tuple `(1, ind)` is appended to the list at index `1` in the `goal` list.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers satisfying 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing three elements: the original `line`, the updated `line`, and the new `line` read from input, `elements` is a dictionary that contains entries for each unique non-'..' string in `line` including the entry for `line[ind]` with the value `(1, ind)`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains entries for each player string found in `line`, `goal` is a list containing tuples for specific strings in `line` with the tuple `(1, ind)` appended to the list at index `1`, `points` is a list `[0, 0]`, `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings read from the input and must have at least one element, `ind` is the last index of `line` (i.e., `len(line) - 1`), the last element of `line` (i.e., `line[ind]`) is not equal to '..' and is not a player string, the second character of the last element of `line` (i.e., `line[ind][1]`) is 'G', `tmp` is 1.**
