Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `time` is 1, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `elements`, `mov`, `grid`, and `player` remain unchanged, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`. If `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `team` is set to the result of `goalIn(pos)`, and `points[team]` is incremented by 1. If `com` is not 'T' and `isPlayer(obj)` is true, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
