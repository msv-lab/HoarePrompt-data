You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))

def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list `cas_de_test` of `t` tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of three players. The function returns a list `resultats` of length `t`, where each element corresponds to the result of the respective tuple in `cas_de_test`. For each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in `cas_de_test`:
- If the sum of the scores (`p1 + p2 + p3`) is odd, the corresponding element in `resultats` is `-1`.
- If the sum is even, the function calculates `total_matchs` as half of the sum. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, the corresponding element in `resultats` is `-1`.
- If neither of the above conditions is met, the function calculates `egalites` as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If `egalites` is less than 0, the corresponding element in `resultats` is `-1`. Otherwise, the corresponding element in `resultats` is `egalites // 2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Total Points Check**: The total points must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (if not a draw) or 2 points (if a draw). This is correctly checked in the code with `total_points % 2 != 0`.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**: The total number of matches is calculated as `total_points // 2`. This is correct because each match contributes 2 points to the total score.

3. **Feasibility Check**: The code checks if the total number of matches is greater than 3 or if the highest score (`p3`) is greater than the total number of matches. This is necessary because:
   - A maximum of 3 matches can be played among 3 players.
   - The highest score cannot exceed the total number of matches.

4. **Draws Calculation**: The formula used to calculate the number of draws is:
   - `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`
   - This formula attempts to account for the points that are not from wins (i.e., points from draws).

5. **Negative Draws Check**: The code ensures that the number of draws is non-negative by checking `if egalites < 0`.

6. **Final Result**: The number of draws is divided by 2 to get the actual number of draw matches, which is then appended to the results list.

However, there is a logical issue in the feasibility check:
- The condition `if total_matchs > 3` is too strict. It should be `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs`, but this is already covered in the next condition `if p3 > total_matchs`.

Additionally, the formula for calculating draws might not be accurate in all cases. For example, the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` does not correctly account for all possible scenarios where the points distribution might be valid but the formula gives an incorrect number of draws.

Let's re-evaluate the logic for calculating draws:
- The maximum number of draws can be calculated by ensuring that the remaining points after accounting for the minimum number of wins are distributed as draws.

Given these considerations, the current implementation has some logical issues that need to be addressed.
