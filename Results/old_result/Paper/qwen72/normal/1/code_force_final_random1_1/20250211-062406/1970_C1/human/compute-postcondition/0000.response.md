Output State: **The function `func` does not take any parameters but is expected to read input from stdin. The input consists of multiple lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `t`, where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2×10^5 and `t`=1, representing the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively. The next `n-1` lines each contain two integers `u` and `v`, where 1 ≤ `u`, `v` ≤ `n`, representing an edge between nodes `u` and `v` in the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer `u_1`, where 1 ≤ `u_1` ≤ `n`, indicating the starting node for the round. After executing the code snippet, `x` is assigned the first integer from the input, and `y` is assigned the second integer from the input.**
