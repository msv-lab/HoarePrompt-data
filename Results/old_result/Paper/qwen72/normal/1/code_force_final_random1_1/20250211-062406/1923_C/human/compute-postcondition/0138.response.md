Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `i` is equal to `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, and `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `(b - a + 1)` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, then these conditions hold true. Otherwise, either `(b - a + 1)` is less than or equal to 1, or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`.***
