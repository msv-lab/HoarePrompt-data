Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input.
- `i` is equal to `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
- The difference `(b - a + 1)` is greater than 1.
- The expression `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will always print the string `'YES'` because the conditions specified in the initial state ensure that the logic leading up to the print statement is satisfied.

Output: **YES**
