Output State: **`n` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index, `sm` is now `suf[1] - smin[1]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `sm` is updated to the difference between the first element of `suf` (at index 1) and the first element of `smin` (at index 1). All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
