Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the calculation of the maximum possible sum after k operations. Specifically, the line `sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm` is incorrect. This formula does not correctly account for the maximum sum that can be achieved by repeatedly adding the maximum subarray sum. Instead, the correct approach should involve calculating the maximum subarray sum and then using it to update the total sum appropriately over k operations.

A correct approach would involve:
1. Finding the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm or a similar method.
2. Using this maximum subarray sum to update the total sum over k operations.

Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
def max_subarray_sum(l):
    max_current = max_global = l[0]
    for i in range(1, len(l)):
        max_current = max(l[i], max_current + l[i])
        if max_current > max_global:
            max_global = max_current
    return max_global

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for j in range(t):
        b = input().split()
        n = int(b[0])
        k = int(b[1])
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the initial sum of the array
        initial_sum = sum(l)
        
        # Find the maximum subarray sum
        max_subarray = max_subarray_sum(l)
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible sum after k operations
        if max_subarray > 0:
            final_sum = initial_sum + max_subarray * ((2 ** k) - 1)
        else:
            final_sum = initial_sum
        
        # Output the result modulo 10^9 + 7
        print(final_sum % (10 ** 9 + 7))
```

This corrected version ensures that the maximum subarray sum is used to update the total sum correctly over k operations, and it handles the case where the maximum subarray sum is non-positive. The original program fails to handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
