Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `custos` is a list containing the calculated costs for each of the `t` test cases. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `i`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `nf`, `y`) remain unchanged as described in the initial state.**

### Explanation:
- **`custos`**: This list will contain the total cost `custo` for each test case after the loop has completed all `x` iterations. Each element in `custos` corresponds to the cost calculated for one test case.
- **Other Variables**: All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `i`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `nf`, `y`) retain their values as they were at the start of the loop or as they were set during the loop's execution for each iteration. These variables are reset or re-initialized for each test case within the loop, but their final values after the loop completes are the same as they were at the end of the last iteration.
