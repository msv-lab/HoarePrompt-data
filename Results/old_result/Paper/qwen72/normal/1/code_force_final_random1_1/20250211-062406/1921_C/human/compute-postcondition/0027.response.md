Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than `n`, `i` is `n`, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 0, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, and `array2` contains the elements it had before. `n` is now the first element of `feat`.**

Explanation:
- The code `n = feat[0]` assigns the value of the first element of the list `feat` to the variable `n`.
- Since `n` was already defined as the first element of `feat` in the initial state, this assignment does not change the value of `n`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
