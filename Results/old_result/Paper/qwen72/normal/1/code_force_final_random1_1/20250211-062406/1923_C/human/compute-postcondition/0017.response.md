The value of `i` is incremented by the value of `x`. Since `x` can be either 1 or 0, the value of `i` will either increase by 1 (if `x` is 1) or remain unchanged (if `x` is 0). The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, and `j`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1, `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())`, `l` is a list of integers that must contain at least two elements, `p` is a list containing elements `[0, i]`, `c` is a list containing elements `[0, j]`, `i` is incremented by `x`, `j` remains 2 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` remains 1.**
