Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`), `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `i` is 0, and the character at the first position of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is 'L'.**
