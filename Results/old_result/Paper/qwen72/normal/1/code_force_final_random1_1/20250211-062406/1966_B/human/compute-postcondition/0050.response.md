The code snippet `gr.append(input())` adds a new element to the list `gr`, which is the result of the `input()` function. Since the initial state specifies that `gr` is an empty list, after executing this code, `gr` will contain one element, which is the input provided.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1), `m` is the new input integer, `gr` is a list containing one input string, `i` is 0, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is `False`**
