The code snippet sets `cur` to 0. This overrides any previous value of `cur`. The other variables (`s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the second character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character in `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cnt` is incremented by 1, `cur` is 0.**
