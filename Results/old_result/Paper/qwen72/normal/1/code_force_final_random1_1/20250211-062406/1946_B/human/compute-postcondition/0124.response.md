The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 1), and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i` (which means `n` must be greater than 1).

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` is a list containing the elements [0, `suf[1]`]. Otherwise, `smin` is a list containing the elements [0, 0].**
