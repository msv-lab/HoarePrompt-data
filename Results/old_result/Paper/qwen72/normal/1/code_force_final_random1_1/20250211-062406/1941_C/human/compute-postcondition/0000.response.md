The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`, which should be equivalent to the variable `t` (the number of test cases). For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, this condition is inherently satisfied. However, since we are adjusting the state specifically for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that the input read by `int(input())` is at least 1, which aligns with the definition of `t`.

Therefore, the state adjustment needed is to ensure that the input read by `int(input())` is at least 1, and the loop counter `_` is initialized to 0 (though this is implicit in Python's `range` function).

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, and the input read by `int(input())` must be at least 1**
