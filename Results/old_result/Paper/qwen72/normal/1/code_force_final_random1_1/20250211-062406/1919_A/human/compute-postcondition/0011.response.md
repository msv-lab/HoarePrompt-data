Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous value), `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner` and the new value of `winner` appended to it, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**

Explanation:
- The values of `t`, `results`, and `winner` remain unchanged.
- The variables `a` and `b` are now assigned the values provided by the user, which are positive integers within the range 1 to 10^9.
