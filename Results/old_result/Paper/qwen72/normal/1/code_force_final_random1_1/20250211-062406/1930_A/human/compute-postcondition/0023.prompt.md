Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is 0, `i` is 2 * n - 2, and the loop is about to start a new set of iterations based on the new input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
    score += l[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is `l[2 * n - 2]`, `i` is 2 * n - 2, and `2 * n` is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is `l[2 * n - 2] + l[2 * n]`, `i` is 2 * n, and `2 * n` is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The code snippet `score += l[i]` updates the value of `score` by adding the value of the element at index `i` in the list `l` to the current value of `score`. Given the initial state, let's determine the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` remains an input integer greater than 0.
- `l` remains a sorted list of integers from the new input.
- `score` was initially `l[2 * n - 2] + l[2 * n]`.
- `i` is `2 * n + 2`.

The code updates `score` to be `l[2 * n - 2] + l[2 * n] + l[2 * n + 2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is `l[2 * n - 2] + l[2 * n] + l[2 * n + 2]`, `i` is `2 * n + 2`, and `2 * n` is greater than 0.**




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
