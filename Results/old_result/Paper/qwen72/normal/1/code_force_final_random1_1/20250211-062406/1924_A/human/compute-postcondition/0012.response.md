Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must contain at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus 97. The bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is 1, and `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`.**
