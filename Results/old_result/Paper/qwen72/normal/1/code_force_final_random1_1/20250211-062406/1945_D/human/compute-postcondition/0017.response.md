The code snippet adds the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to the variable `total`. Here's the detailed step-by-step impact:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` and `m` are integers where \(1 \leq m \leq n \leq 200,000\)
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)
   - `b` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\)
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\)
   - `cases` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0
   - `c` is 0
   - `na_frente` is at least 0
   - `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`
   - `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input
   - `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input
   - `total` is 0
   - `v` is `na_frente`
   - `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`
   - `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The value of `total` is updated by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to it.

3. **Calculation**:
   - Let `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` be denoted as `cost_b_v`.
   - The new value of `total` is `total + cost_b_v`.

4. **Output State**:
   - `total` is now `total + cost_b_v`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers where \(1 \leq m \leq n \leq 200,000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `b` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\), `cases` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input, `total` is `total + cost_b_v`, `v` is `na_frente`, and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
