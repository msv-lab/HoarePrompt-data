Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000 and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is 1000 + the sum of the first `i` elements of `x`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` remains an integer within the range 2 to 500.
- The list `x` remains unchanged as it was read from the input.
- The list `a` is now populated such that the first element `a[0]` is still 1000, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is calculated as 1000 plus the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `x`.
- The loop counter `i` reaches the value `n-1`, indicating that the loop has run `n-1` times.
- The condition `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 to ensure the loop runs at least once.
