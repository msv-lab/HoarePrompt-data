Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 2`. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<` and `idx_B` was initially empty, `idx_B` is a list containing `[i]` and `B` is a list containing `[0, 0]`. If `idx_B` was not empty, `x` is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1)) * len(idx_B)`, and `B` is a list with one additional element `x` appended to it, followed by another `0`. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is not `<`, `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged, and `B` is a list containing `[0, 0]`.***
