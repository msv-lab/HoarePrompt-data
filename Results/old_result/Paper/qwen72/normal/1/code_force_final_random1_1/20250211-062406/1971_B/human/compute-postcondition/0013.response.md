To determine what will be printed by the `print(b)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **`s`**: This is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
2. **`b`**: This is a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in ascending order.
3. **`s` is not equal to `b`**: This means that the original string `s` is not already sorted in ascending order.

Given these conditions, the `print(b)` statement will print the string `b`, which is the sorted version of `s` in ascending order.

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact string that will be printed. However, we know that `b` will be the sorted version of `s`.

Output: **b (where b is the string s sorted in ascending order)**
