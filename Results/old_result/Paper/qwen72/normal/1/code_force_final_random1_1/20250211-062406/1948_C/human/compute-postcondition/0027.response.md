Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a new string input by the user. If `i + 1 < n` and the character at position `i` in `a` is '<' and the character at position `i + 1` in `b` is '<', or if the character at position `i` in `a` is '<' and the character at position `i - 1` in `b` is '<', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statements.***
