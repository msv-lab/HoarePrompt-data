Postcondition: ***`a` contains the remaining health of each monster, with the element at index `sorted_indices[pos]` reduced by `delta`. `rest` is now equal to `k - delta`. `pos` is the number of monsters that have been defeated, which is also the number of elements in `a` that are 0. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, then `pos` is incremented by 1 (indicating one more monster has been defeated), and the element at `sorted_indices[pos-1]` in `a` is set to 0. The absolute value of the element at the index `sorted_indices[pos]` in `x` will still not be equal to `distance + 1`, assuming there are any monsters left with positive health. The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged except for the modifications to `a` and `rest` as described. `distance` is now `distance + 1`. `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and the value at `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` depending on whether `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0 or not.***
