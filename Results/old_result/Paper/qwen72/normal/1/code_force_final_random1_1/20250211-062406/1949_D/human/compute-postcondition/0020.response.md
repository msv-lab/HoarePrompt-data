Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, `j` is 2, `b[1]` is incremented by 1, `b[2]` is incremented by 1.** 

Explanation: The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[2]` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `b[2]` while keeping all other initial conditions valid.
