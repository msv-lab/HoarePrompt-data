Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the length of a permutation, and `k` is a non-negative integer representing a required Manhattan value. The function returns a modified list `l` derived from the initial list `[1, 2, ..., n]`. Depending on the value of `k`, the function may rearrange the elements of `l` by moving the last element to a new position within the list, either at the beginning or at a specific index `-k`. The function ensures that the final list `l` reflects the required rearrangements based on the value of `k`, and `k` is reduced to 0 by the end of the function. The final state of the program is that `l` is a permutation of the original list with elements rearranged according to the specified rules, and `k` is 0. **
