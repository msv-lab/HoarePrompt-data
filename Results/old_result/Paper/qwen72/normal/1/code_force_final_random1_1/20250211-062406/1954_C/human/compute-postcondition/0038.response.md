To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where \(1 \leq x, y < 10^{100}\), and consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
- `a` and `b` are lists of integers derived from the input strings `x` and `y`, respectively, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9.
- `i` is an integer that can be any value from 0 to `len(a)`.
- `new` and `new2` are lists constructed based on the value of `i`:
  - If `i` is not equal to `len(a)`, `new` is a list where the first `i` elements are `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the rest are `None`.
  - `new2` is a list where the first `i` elements are `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the rest are `None`.
  - If `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `new` is a list where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`.
  - `new2` is a list where each element is `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `new2` based on `i`:**
   - If `i` is not equal to `len(a)`, `new2` will have the first `i` elements as `min(a[j], b[j])` and the rest as `None`.
   - If `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `new2` will have all elements as `max(a[j], b[j])`.

2. **Construct the output string:**
   - The `print` statement joins the elements of `new2` into a single string.
   - If `i` is not equal to `len(a)`, the output will include the first `i` elements of `new2` (which are `min(a[j], b[j])`) followed by `None` for the remaining elements.
   - If `i` is equal to `len(a)`, the output will include all elements of `new2` (which are `max(a[j], b[j])`).

### Conclusion:
- If `i` is not equal to `len(a)`, the output will be a string of the first `i` minimum values followed by `None` for the remaining elements.
- If `i` is equal to `len(a)`, the output will be a string of the maximum values for all elements.

### Final Output:
Output: **a string of the first `i` minimum values followed by `None` for the remaining elements if `i` is not equal to `len(a)`, or a string of the maximum values for all elements if `i` is equal to `len(a)`**. 

For clarity, if `i` is equal to `len(a)`, the output will be:
Output: **a string of the maximum values for all elements in `a` and `b`**.
