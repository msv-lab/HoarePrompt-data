Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `m` is the new input integer and must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a dictionary that will contain keys from 2 to `n` with values determined by the loop logic, and `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and contains the key `n - 1` with the value 1. After the if-else block, `x` and `y` are updated to the new pair of integers provided by the user input. If the new `y` > new `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.***
