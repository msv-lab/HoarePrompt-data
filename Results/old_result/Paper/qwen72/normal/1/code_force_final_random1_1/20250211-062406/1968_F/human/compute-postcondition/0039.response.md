Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the same as initially assigned, `q` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by `n + 4`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the corresponding integer value from `data` starting from `data[idx - n - 6]` to `data[idx - 5]`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index, `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values in `pf` and values being lists of indices where these `pf` values occur, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.**
