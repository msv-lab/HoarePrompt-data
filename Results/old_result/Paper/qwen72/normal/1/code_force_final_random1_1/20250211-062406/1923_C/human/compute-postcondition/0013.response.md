The code snippet `c.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Given the initial state, `c` starts as a list containing a single element `[0]`. The value of `j` is determined based on the value of `x`: if `x` is 1, `j` is 1; otherwise, `j` is 0.

Therefore, after executing the code, the list `c` will contain two elements: the original `[0]` and the new value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1, `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())`, `l` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `p` is a list containing elements `[0, i]`, `c` is a list containing elements `[0, j]`, `i` is 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `i` is 0, and `j` is 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 0.**
