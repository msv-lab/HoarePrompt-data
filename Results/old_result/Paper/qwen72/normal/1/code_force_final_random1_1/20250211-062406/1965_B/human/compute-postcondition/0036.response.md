Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, with `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. `b` is the binary string of `n` without the '0b' prefix, and `l` is the length of `b`. If `k == 1`, `l` is the length of `b` and must be greater than or equal to the initial `l`, `n` is not equal to 2, `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(l-1)]`, and `i` is `l`. If `k != 1`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary string of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)` followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then continues with `2^i` for each `i` from `lk` to `l-1`, and `i` is `l-1`.***
