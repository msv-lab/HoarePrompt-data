Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, and k is an even integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m). Arrays a and b contain n and m integers respectively, where each element is an integer in the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6.**
