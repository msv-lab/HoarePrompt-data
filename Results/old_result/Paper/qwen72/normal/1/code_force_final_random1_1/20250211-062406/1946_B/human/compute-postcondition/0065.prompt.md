Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the new `b`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the new `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is a list containing a single element `[0]`, `i` is `n`, `smin` is a list where each element at index `i` (from 0 to `n`) is the minimum value of the suffix sums from `suf[1]` to `suf[i+1]`, `sm` is updated based on the condition described in the initial state.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the new `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the new `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is now a list containing two elements `[0, suf[0] + l[0]]`, `i` is 0, `smin` is a list where each element at index `i` (from 0 to `n`) is the minimum value of the suffix sums from `suf[1]` to `suf[i+1]`, `sm` is updated based on the condition described in the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the new `b` and must be greater than 1, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the new `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is now a list containing three elements `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1]]`, `i` is 1, `smin` is a list where each element at index `i` (from 0 to `n`) is the minimum value of the suffix sums from `suf[1]` to `suf[i+1]`, `sm` is updated based on the condition described in the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the new `b` and must be greater than 1, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the new `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input split by whitespace, `suf` is now a list containing four elements `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], suf[2] + l[2]]`, `i` is 2, `smin` is a list where each element at index `i` (from 0 to `n`) is the minimum value of the suffix sums from `suf[1]` to `suf[i+1]`, `sm` is updated based on the condition described in the initial state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
