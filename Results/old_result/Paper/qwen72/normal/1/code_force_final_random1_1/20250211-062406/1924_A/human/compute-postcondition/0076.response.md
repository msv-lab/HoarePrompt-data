Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least two characters, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cur` is updated by adding `1 << cur_ss` to its current value.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `cur_ss` is calculated as the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97, and this value is used in the calculation of `cur`.
- The conditions for `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur` resetting are not triggered by this code snippet, so they remain as specified in the initial state.
