Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `n` is not equal to `m`.
- `m` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `m` is not equal to `n - 1`.
- Both `m` and `n` are even numbers.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This code snippet simply prints the string `'Yes'`. The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables or conditions.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Yes**
