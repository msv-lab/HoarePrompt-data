Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `time` is 0.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`.
   - `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
   - `player` is `obj` if `obj` is a player, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `time` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `player` is determined based on the value of `obj`:
     - If `obj` is a player, then `player` is `obj`.
     - Otherwise, `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `time` is 0, the first part of the print statement will always be `0`.
   - The second part of the print statement will be the value of `player`.

Given the initial state, the value of `player` depends on whether `obj` is a player or not:
- If `obj` is a player, then `player` is `obj`.
- If `obj` is not a player, then `player` is the value at `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

Since the exact values of `obj`, `command`, `elements`, `mov`, and `grid` are not provided, we can only describe the output in general terms.

Output: **0 [player] ELIMINATED (where [player] is either the value of `obj` if `obj` is a player, or the value at `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if `obj` is not a player)**
