To determine what will be printed by the `print('NO')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `m` is greater than 0 but less than its current value.
- `a` and `b` are updated to new values provided by the user input.
- `i` is now equal to `c[b] - c[a - 1]` with the new values of `a` and `b`.
- `s` is now equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]` with the new values of `a` and `b`.

### Conditions:
- If `(b - a + 1)` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, then these conditions hold true.
- Otherwise, either `(b - a + 1)` is less than or equal to 1, or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`.

### Analysis:
The `print('NO')` statement is executed, which means that the conditions described in the initial state did not hold true. Specifically, the conditions:
- `(b - a + 1) > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` did not both hold true.
- Therefore, either `(b - a + 1) <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.

### Conclusion:
The `print('NO')` statement will always print "NO" because it is executed when the conditions do not hold true.

Output: **NO**
