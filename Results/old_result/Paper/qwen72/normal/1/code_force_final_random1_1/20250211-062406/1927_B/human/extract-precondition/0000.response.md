Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n), representing the trace of the string. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
