Postcondition: ***`i` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is unchanged, `x` is greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[x + 1]`, `gap` is `a[x + 1] - a[x] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` is a list containing two instances of `gap`, and `even` is an empty list. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `odd` is an empty list, and `even` is a list containing `gap`. If `gap` is 1 or less, `odd` is a list containing one instance of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, otherwise `odd` is an empty list, and `even` is an empty list.***
