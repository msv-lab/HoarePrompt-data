Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index. If `suf[1] - smin[1]` is greater than `sm` or `sm` is -111, then `sm` is updated to `suf[1] - smin[1]`. Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged.***
