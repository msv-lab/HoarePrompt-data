Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0.
- `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is the logarithm base 2 of the input integer.
- `power` is `power - 1` and is not equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`n`**: This is the logarithm base 2 of the input integer. For example, if the input integer is 8, then `n = log2(8) = 3`.
2. **`power`**: The initial value of `power` is not explicitly given, but it is stated that `power` is `power - 1` and is not equal to `n`. This implies that `power` is initially some value, and then it is decremented by 1. Since `power` is not equal to `n`, it must be a different value.

Given the conditions, let's assume the initial value of `power` is `k`. After the decrement, `power` becomes `k - 1`. The condition `power != n` means that `k - 1` is not equal to `n`.

### Calculation:
- The code snippet `print(2 ** power)` will print \(2^{(k - 1)}\).

Since the exact initial value of `power` (denoted as `k`) is not provided, we can only express the output in terms of `k`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2 ** (k - 1) (where k is the initial value of power and k - 1 is not equal to n)**
