Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n-3`, `n` must be at least 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `d2[i]` is 1 + `d2[i + 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]` updates the value of `d2[i]` to be 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
