Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `best` is 0.
- The input provided to `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`k`**: According to the initial state, `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' or 1 if no such `i` exists. Since `i` is currently 1 and there is no information about `res` being '<' for any previous value of `i`, `k` will be 1.
2. **`best`**: The initial state specifies that `best` is 0.
3. **`i`**: The initial state specifies that `i` is 1.

### Output:
The print statement will output the following values:
- `'?'` (a string literal)
- `k` (which is 1)
- `best` (which is 0)
- `k` (which is 1 again)
- `i` (which is 1)

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 1 0 1 1**
