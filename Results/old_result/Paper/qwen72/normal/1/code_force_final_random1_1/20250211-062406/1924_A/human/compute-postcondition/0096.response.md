To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than 0, and `i` starts at 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration (we need to set this to 0 for the loop to start)
- `n` is an input integer (not relevant to the loop head)
- `k` is an input integer (must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute)
- `m` is an input integer (not relevant to the loop head)
- `s` is an input string (not relevant to the loop head)
- `cur` is reset to 0 if it reached `(1 << k) - 1` during any iteration, otherwise it holds the final value after processing all characters in `s` (not relevant to the loop head)
- `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop (not relevant to the loop head)
- `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1` (not relevant to the loop head)
- `cnt` is less than `n` (not relevant to the loop head)
- `tmp` is an empty string (`''`) (not relevant to the loop head)

For the loop to execute, we need:
- `i` to be 0
- `k` to be greater than 0

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
