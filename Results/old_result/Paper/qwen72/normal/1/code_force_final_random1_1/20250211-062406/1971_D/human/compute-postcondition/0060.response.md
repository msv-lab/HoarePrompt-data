To determine what will be printed by the `print(count)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **`s` is a new input string with a length greater than 1**: This means `s` is a non-empty string with at least two characters.
2. **`t` is greater than 1**: This variable is mentioned but not used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output.
3. **`i` is 1**: This variable is mentioned but not used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output.
4. **`j` is `len(s) - 1`**: This variable is mentioned but not used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output.
5. **`count` is the number of adjacent character pairs in `s` that are different**: This means `count` is calculated by iterating through the string `s` and counting how many times a character is different from the next character.
6. **If `flag` is True, `count` is reduced by 1, indicating that at least one pair of adjacent characters in `s` consists of '0' followed by '1'**: This means if there is at least one pair of adjacent characters in `s` where the first character is '0' and the second character is '1', then `count` is reduced by 1.
7. **Otherwise, `flag` remains False, and `count` remains unchanged**: If no such pair exists, `count` remains as initially calculated.

Given this information, the value of `count` depends on the content of the string `s` and the presence of the specific pattern '01'. 

- If `s` contains at least one '01' pair, `count` will be reduced by 1.
- If `s` does not contain any '01' pair, `count` will remain the number of adjacent character pairs that are different.

Therefore, the output of the `print(count)` statement will be the final value of `count` after applying the reduction if applicable.

Output: **count (where count is the number of adjacent character pairs in `s` that are different, reduced by 1 if `s` contains at least one '01' pair)**
