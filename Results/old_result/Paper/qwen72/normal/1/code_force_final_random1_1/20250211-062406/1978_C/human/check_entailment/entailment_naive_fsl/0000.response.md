Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from being correct for all potential cases:

1. **Handling of Odd and Even `n`**: The function `func_4` calculates the maximum possible `k` for a given `n`. However, the formula used for calculating `max_k` is incorrect. For an odd `n`, the maximum `k` should be `(n-1) * n // 2`, and for an even `n`, it should be `n * (n-2) // 2`. The current implementation uses `(n ** 2 - 1) // 2` for odd `n` and `n ** 2 // 2` for even `n`, which are incorrect.

2. **Swapping Logic in `func_1` and `func_3`**: The logic for swapping elements in the permutation is not clear and may not always produce a valid permutation with the desired Manhattan value. Specifically, the way `func_3` swaps elements might not ensure that the resulting permutation has the correct Manhattan value.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, when `k` is 0, the program should return the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, but the current logic might not always do this correctly.

4. **Input Handling**: The function `func_4` reads input from `stdin`, which is not a standard practice for a function that is supposed to be tested in isolation. This makes it difficult to test the function with different inputs programmatically.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- **Input**: `n = 4, k = 6`
- **Expected Output**: A permutation of length 4 with a Manhattan value of 6, such as `[4, 2, 3, 1]`.
- **Actual Output**: The program might not produce a valid permutation or might produce an incorrect permutation.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and thus, it is incorrect.
