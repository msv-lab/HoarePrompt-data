Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described.

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` reads input directly, which is not ideal when it is called multiple times within `func_2`. It would be better to pass the values of `n` and `m` as arguments to `func_1`.

2. **Loop Conditions**: The loop conditions in `func_1` are not correctly set up to ensure that all possible pairs `(a, b)` are considered. Specifically, the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` does not guarantee that `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`.

3. **GCD Calculation**: The GCD calculation is correct, but the logic for counting valid pairs is flawed. The line `cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect because it does not properly account for the pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`.

4. **Efficiency**: The current approach is inefficient and may not handle large inputs within the constraints. A more efficient approach is needed to solve the problem within the given limits.

To fix these issues, a more structured and efficient approach is required. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    def gcd(x, y):
        return math.gcd(x, y)
    
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

# Example usage:
func_2()
```

This corrected version ensures that all pairs `(a, b)` are checked correctly and efficiently. However, this approach might still be too slow for large inputs. Further optimization, such as using number theory properties or dynamic programming, might be necessary to handle the upper limits of the problem.
