Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `l` is `l + 1`, `r` is 0, `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions described in the else part.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`j`, `i`, `idx_B`, `B`, `r`, `a`, and `b`) retain their previous values or are updated based on the conditions described in the else part of the initial state.
