Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0
        ans += ss


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus 97. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `s`, and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least two characters, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97. If `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `s`, and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least one more character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the next character of `s` minus 97, `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` if `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, otherwise `cur` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged. If `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to `ans + ss`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
