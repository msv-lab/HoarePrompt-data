Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value entered by the user (1 <= t <= 1000), `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())
    winner = func_1(a, b)
    results.append(winner)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous value), `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner` and the new value of `winner` appended to it, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous value), `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner` and the new value of `winner` appended to it, `winner` remains the result of `func_1(a, b)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
