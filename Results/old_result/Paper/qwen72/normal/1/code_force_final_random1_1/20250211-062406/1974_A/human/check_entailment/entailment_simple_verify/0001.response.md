### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Screen Calculation**:
   - The variable `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`. This formula is correct because it determines the minimum number of screens required to fit all 2x2 icons. Each screen can fit at most 2 2x2 icons (since \(2 \times 4 = 8\) cells are used, leaving 7 cells free). Therefore, `(y + 1) // 2` screens are needed to ensure all 2x2 icons fit.

3. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`. This correctly represents the remaining space on the screens after placing all 2x2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells, and `z` screens will have `15 * z` cells in total. Subtracting the space taken by `y` 2x2 icons (which is `y * 4` cells) gives the remaining space `m`.

4. **Adjusting for 1x1 Icons**:
   - The condition `if m < a:` is incorrect. It should be `if m < x:`. The variable `a` is the number of test cases, not the number of 1x1 icons. This is a critical error that would cause incorrect results.
   - The corrected condition `if m < x:` ensures that if the remaining space `m` is less than the number of 1x1 icons `x`, additional screens are needed. The number of additional screens required is calculated as `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`. This formula ensures that we account for any remaining 1x1 icons that cannot fit into the current screens.

5. **Output**:
   - The total number of screens `z` is printed for each test case.

### Issues:
- The original program has a logical error where it incorrectly uses `a` instead of `x` in the condition `if m < a:`. This is a critical error that would cause incorrect results.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < x:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical error where it incorrectly uses `a` instead of `x` in the condition `if m < a:`. After correcting this, the program should work correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
