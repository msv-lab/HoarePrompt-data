### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the number of permutations of length `n` that match the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums, with the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function indeed implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. This is crucial for computing modular inverses.
   - **func_2(a, b)**: This function computes the modular inverse of `b` under modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and then multiplies it by `a`. This is essential for performing division in modular arithmetic, which is necessary for combinatorial calculations.

3. **Algorithm for Permutations**:
   - The main logic of the program involves calculating the number of valid permutations using combinatorial methods. The key steps include:
     - Precomputing factorials modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers efficiently.
     - Checking the validity of the input conditions (e.g., the last prefix maximum should be the first suffix maximum, the first prefix maximum should be 1, and the last suffix maximum should be `n`).
     - Using the precomputed factorials and modular inverses to calculate the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements between the given prefix and suffix maximums.

4. **Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code shows that the program correctly handles the precomputation of factorials and the modular arithmetic required for combinatorial calculations.
   - The program checks the validity of the input conditions and correctly calculates the number of valid permutations using the combinatorial formula.
   - The use of `func_1` and `func_2` is appropriate for handling the modular arithmetic needed for the combinatorial calculations.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions and the main logic of the program are correctly implemented to solve the problem as described. The program correctly counts the number of valid permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
