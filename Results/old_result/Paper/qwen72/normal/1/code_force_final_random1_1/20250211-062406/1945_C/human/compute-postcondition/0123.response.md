Postcondition: ***`lst` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `lst`, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is updated to the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `final` is an empty list unless `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, in which case `final` contains the first element of `lst`.***
