Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of calculating how long it takes for a pinball to leave a one-dimensional grid based on the direction indicators ('<' and '>') at each cell. The solution involves two main parts: preprocessing the string to gather information about the positions and effects of '>' and '<' characters, and then using this information to compute the time for the pinball to exit the grid from each starting position.

### Preprocessing:
1. **List `A` and `idx_A`**:
   - These lists are used to store the cumulative effect of '>' characters from left to right.
   - For each '>' character encountered, the program calculates the total distance traveled by the pinball due to the presence of previous '>' characters and stores this in `A`.
   - `idx_A` keeps track of the indices of these '>' characters.

2. **List `B` and `idx_B`**:
   - Similar to `A` and `idx_A`, but for '<' characters from right to left.
   - For each '<' character encountered, the program calculates the total distance traveled by the pinball due to the presence of previous '<' characters and stores this in `B`.
   - `idx_B` keeps track of the indices of these '<' characters.

### Calculation of Exit Times:
- The program iterates through each cell of the grid and uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from that cell.
- Depending on whether the current cell contains '>' or '<', different calculations are performed to account for the movement and inversion of the pinball.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the preprocessing and calculation steps as described in the problem statement.
- The logic for handling the movement and inversion of the pinball is consistent with the rules provided.
- The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as when there are no '>' or '<' characters in the string.

Given the complexity of the problem and the detailed steps taken by the program, it appears to be correctly implementing the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
