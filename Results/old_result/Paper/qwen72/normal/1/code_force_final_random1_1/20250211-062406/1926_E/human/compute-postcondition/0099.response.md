Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing at least one element, `tot` is the next element in `L`, `pow` is 2, and `m` is the last value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` becomes 0. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
