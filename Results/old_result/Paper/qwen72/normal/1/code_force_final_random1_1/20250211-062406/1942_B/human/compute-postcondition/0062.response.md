Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list of integers `ar` of length `n`. It then computes a new list `res` of the same length, where each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`, with `mex` initially set to `n` and updated during the computation. The function prints the resulting list `res` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates without returning any value. **
