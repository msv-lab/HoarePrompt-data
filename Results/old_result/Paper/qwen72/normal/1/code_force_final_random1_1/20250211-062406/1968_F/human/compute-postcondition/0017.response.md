Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `q` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is increased by 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `a[1]` which is set to `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `{0: [0], pf[1]: []}`, `i` is 1, `pf[1]` is `a[1]`, and `pf[i]` is not in `mp`.**

Explanation:
- The line `mp[pf[i]] = []` adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary `mp` where the key is `pf[1]` (which is equal to `a[1]`), and the value is an empty list `[]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
