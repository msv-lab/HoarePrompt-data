Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `q` are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30; each query consists of two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input. `idx` is 1. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    q = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    a = [0] * (n + 1)
    pf = [0] * (n + 1)
    mp = {(0): [0]}
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        a[i] = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
        if pf[i] not in mp:
            mp[pf[i]] = []
        mp[pf[i]].append(i)
    for _ in range(q):
        l = int(data[idx])
        r = int(data[idx + 1])
        idx += 2
        x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
        if x == 0:
            results.append('YES')
            continue
        v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
        v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
        it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
        it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
        if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    results.append('')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the same as initially assigned, `q` is 0, `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2)`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the corresponding integer value from `data` starting from `data[idx - n - (q * (n + 2))]` to `data[idx - (q * (n + 2)) - 1]`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index, `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values in `pf` and values being lists of indices where these `pf` values occur, `results` contains the final results of the loop's operations ('YES' or 'NO' for each iteration), and the last element of `results` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - (n + 2) * q - 1]` and must be at least 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - (n + 2) * q - 2]`, `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2) + n + 1`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is `int(data[idx - (n + 2) * q - n + i - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is the cumulative XOR of elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to the unique values in `pf` and their respective indices as values, `results` contains the final results of the loop's operations ('YES' or 'NO' for each iteration), with the last element being an empty string, `i` is `n`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index in `v2` just before the position where `r` would be inserted to maintain sorted order. An additional empty string is appended to the `results` list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop completes all iterations, `mp` will contain all the unique prefix XOR values encountered during the loop, with each value mapped to a list of indices where it occurs. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating the loop has run `n` times. The array `a` will be populated with integers from `data` starting from index `0` up to `n-1`. The array `pf` will store the cumulative XOR values of elements in `a` up to each index. The variable `idx` will be equal to `n + 2 * q`, as it was incremented by 2 for each iteration. The variable `q` will be equal to 0, as the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `results` will contain a list of strings, each either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on the conditions evaluated within the loop for each query, plus an additional empty string at the end. All other variables (`t`, `data`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`) will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
