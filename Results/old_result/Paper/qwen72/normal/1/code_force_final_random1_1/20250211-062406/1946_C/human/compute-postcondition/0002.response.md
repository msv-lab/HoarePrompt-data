The only object in the loop head is the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`, which determines how many times the loop will run. Since the loop has already executed once, the number of iterations left is one less than the original value read from `sys.stdin`.

At the end of the last iteration, the input read from `sys.stdin` was a valid integer greater than 0, and the `solve()` function has been called. For the loop to execute one more time, the remaining number of iterations must be greater than 0.

Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly tracked, we can infer that the loop will continue to execute as long as the initial value read from `sys.stdin` minus the number of iterations completed is greater than 0.

State: **The input read from `sys.stdin` must be a valid integer greater than 1, and the `solve()` function has been called.**
