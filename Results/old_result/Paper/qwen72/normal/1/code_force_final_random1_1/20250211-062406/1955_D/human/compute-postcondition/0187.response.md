Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0; otherwise, `curr` remains 0. All elements in `b_values` are unique and represent the distinct elements from the list `b`. `cnt_b[i]` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `b` for each element `i` in `b_values` except for `a[0]` which is now one less. `n` remains an input integer, `k` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers read from the input, `b` remains a list of integers read from the input, and the current value of `a[i]` is in `b_values`.***
