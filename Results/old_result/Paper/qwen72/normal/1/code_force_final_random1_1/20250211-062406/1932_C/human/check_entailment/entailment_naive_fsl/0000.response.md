Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it works for every potential case:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Processing Commands**:
   - The function `func_1` processes the commands in the string `s`.
   - It maintains two pointers `l` and `r` to track the leftmost and rightmost indices of the array `a`.
   - For each command in `s`, it appends the appropriate element to the list `b` and updates the pointers accordingly.

3. **Calculating the Product Modulo**:
   - After processing all commands, the program calculates the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` modulo `m` for each step.
   - It uses a running product `p` to keep track of the product modulo `m` and appends the result to the list `ans`.

4. **Reversing the Results**:
   - The results are stored in reverse order due to the way the elements are processed, so the final result is reversed before returning.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case as required.

The program handles all edge cases, including:
- When `n` is 1.
- When all commands are 'L' or 'R'.
- When the product of the elements is large and needs to be taken modulo `m`.

Since the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases, it is considered correct.
