Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`. If `t1` is not in the set `st` and `t2` is in the set `st`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates `x` times, so after all iterations, `i` will be `x - 1`.
- For each iteration, `t1` and `t2` are calculated as `(a[i] + 1) % n` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` respectively.
- If `t1` is not in the set `st` and `t2` is in the set `st`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
- After the loop completes, the final value of `i` will be `x - 1`, and the final value of `ans` will depend on how many times the condition `t1 not in st and t2 in st` was true during the loop's execution.
