Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `mov`, `grid`, and `player` remain unchanged unless specified. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` is equal to '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is `True`. If `el` is equal to '.S', `team` is set to 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is set to 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `len(command) != 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, and `nxt` is (`pos[0]` + `mov[com][0]`, `pos[1]` + `mov[com][1]`). If `obj == '.B'` and either `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` or `isPlayer(obj)` and `elements['.B'] == nxt`, then `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`. If `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)` and `points[team]` is increased by 1. If `com` is not 'T' and `isPlayer(obj)` is true, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]` before the update, `nxt` is (`pos[0]` + `mov[com][0]`, `pos[1]` + `mov[com][1]`), and `elements[obj]` is now `nxt`. If `com` is not 'T' and `isPlayer(obj)` is false, `pos` remains the value of `elements[obj]` and `nxt` is (`pos[0]` + `mov[com][0]`, `pos[1]` + `mov[com][1]`).***
