Postcondition: ***`lst` has all its original elements, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `final` contains all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`, sorted in ascending order, and `c1` is the integer result of `o * 100 // n`. The length of `final` is 0, and `c1` is less than 50.***
