The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given the initial state, `ans` can be 0, 1, or 2. After the increment, the new value of `ans` will be:

- If `ans` was 0, it becomes 1.
- If `ans` was 1, it becomes 2.
- If `ans` was 2, it becomes 3.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 1, 2, or 3. If `curr` was greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2 or 3, and the conditions related to `cnt_b` and `a` remain unchanged. If `curr` was less than `k`, `ans` is 1, and the conditions related to `cnt_b` and `a` remain unchanged. If `a[1]` is in `b_values`, the count of `a[1]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[1]]` was greater than 0 before the increment, `curr` is now `curr - 1`. Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged. If `a[1 + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[1 + m]]` is decremented by 1, and `curr` is now `curr + 1`. If `a[1 + m]` is not in `b_values`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
