The value of `score` is incremented by the first element of the list `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged, except that `i` is used to access the first element of `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is now equal to the first element of `l`, `i` is 0, and `2 * n` is greater than 0.**
