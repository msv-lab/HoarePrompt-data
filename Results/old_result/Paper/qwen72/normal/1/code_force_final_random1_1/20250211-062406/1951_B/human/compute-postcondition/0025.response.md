To determine what will be printed by the `print(ind)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **List `a`**: 
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`.
   - Each element `a_i` is unique and within the range `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`.

2. **Variable `x`**:
   - `x` is equal to `a[14]`. This means `x` is the 15th element in the list `a` (since Python uses 0-based indexing).

3. **List `ind`**:
   - `ind` is a list containing the indices of up to 2 elements in `a` that are greater than `x`.
   - If there are fewer than 2 elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, `ind` will contain the indices of those elements.

4. **Variable `c`**:
   - `c` is 2 if there are at least 2 elements in `a` greater than `x`.
   - Otherwise, `c` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `x` and less than 2.

5. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is the index of the last element checked in the loop, which could be any value from 0 to `n-1` depending on when the loop breaks or completes.

6. **Variable `n`**:
   - `n` is the length of the list `a`.

7. **Variable `k`**:
   - `k` is 14, which is used to determine `x` as `a[14]`.

Given this information, the `print(ind)` statement will print the list `ind`, which contains the indices of up to 2 elements in `a` that are greater than `x`.

### Explanation of the Output:
- The exact values of the indices in `ind` depend on the specific elements in the list `a` and their positions relative to `x`.
- Since the exact values of the elements in `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical indices.
- However, we know that `ind` will contain up to 2 indices of elements in `a` that are greater than `x`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ind (where ind is a list containing the indices of up to 2 elements in a that are greater than x)**
