The code snippet `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt_b` at the index corresponding to the first element of `b` (since `i` is 0). Given that initially `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for every `i` in `b_values`, the value of `cnt_b[b[0]]` will now be 1.

Output State: **All elements in `b_values` have been processed, `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for every `i` in `b_values` except for `cnt_b[b[0]]` which is 1. `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0.**
