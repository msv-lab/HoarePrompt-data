The value of `count` is updated from `m + 1` to `2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than or equal to 5, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1 + int((int(n / 4) - 3) / 4) + 1 + int((int(n / 5) - 4) / 5) + 1 + ... + int((int(n / m) - (m - 1)) / m) + 1`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `int(n / m) - (m - 1)`**.
