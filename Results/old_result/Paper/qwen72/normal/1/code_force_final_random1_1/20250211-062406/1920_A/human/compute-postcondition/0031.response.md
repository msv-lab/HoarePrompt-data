The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `t` and `v`. The initial state specifies conditions based on the value of `t` and how `v` affects `start` and `end`. However, the code snippet only updates `t` and `v` and does not modify `start`, `end`, `num`, `n`, or `i`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` and `v` are integers from the input, `start` and `end` remain unchanged, and `num` remains unchanged.**
