Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. The function computes a specific value `sm` for each test case based on the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` and the operations defined by `k`. The final value of `sm` is adjusted to ensure it is non-negative and then printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates. **
