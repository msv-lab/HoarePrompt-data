Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user from the second input, `ad` is a list containing only the element 0, `bd` is a list containing only the element 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `bd = [0]` initializes a new list `bd` with a single element 0.
- The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and `ad` remain unchanged.
- The new list `bd` is now part of the state, containing only the element 0.
