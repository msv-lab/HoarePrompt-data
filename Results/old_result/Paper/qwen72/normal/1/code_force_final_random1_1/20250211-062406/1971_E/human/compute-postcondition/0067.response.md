Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `l` is equal to `q - 1`, `m` is the final calculated value based on the formula `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` for the last iteration, `ql` is the final adjusted value after subtracting `a[s - 1]` for the last iteration, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql` for the last iteration, and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.**
