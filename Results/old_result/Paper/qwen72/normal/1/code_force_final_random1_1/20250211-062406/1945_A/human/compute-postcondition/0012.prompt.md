Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a, b, and c are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    a, b, c = map(int, s.split())
    b += c
    print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a, b, and c are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. The values of a, b, and c are now updated to the integers parsed from the first line of the input provided to `open(0)`. After the code execution, `b` is equal to the original value of `b` plus the original value of `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is the same as before, `b` is now `b + c`, `c` is the same as before, `s` is the second line of the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is the first integer from the third line of the input, `b` is the sum of the second and third integers from the third line of the input, `c` is the third integer from the third line of the input, `s` is the third line of the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
