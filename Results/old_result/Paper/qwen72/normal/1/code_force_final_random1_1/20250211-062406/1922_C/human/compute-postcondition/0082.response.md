Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by the user input, if the last `y` > `x`, the condition `y` > `x` holds true, if the last `y` ≤ `x`, the condition `y` ≤ `x` holds true, and the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`.***
