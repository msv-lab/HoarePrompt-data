Postcondition: ***`delta` is the minimum of the original `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`, `rest` is now `k - 3 * delta`, `pos` is the number of monsters that have been defeated and must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`, `distance` is now `distance + 1`, and the values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged except for the modifications to `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `delta` is the minimum of the original `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is decreased by `delta`, `pos` is incremented by 1, and the values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged except for the modifications to `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`.***
