Output State: **All initial conditions remain unchanged, except that `l` is now the integer value of `data[idx-2]`, `r` is now the integer value of `data[idx-1]`, `idx` is increased by 2, and `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.** 

This means that the values of `l` and `r` are set to the integer values of `data[idx-2]` and `data[idx-1]` respectively, `idx` is incremented by 2, and `x` is calculated as the bitwise XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`. All other initial conditions remain the same.
