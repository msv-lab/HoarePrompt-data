Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None`, `mex` is now equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `ar[len(ar) - 2]` is greater than 0, `res[i]` is `n - 2 * ar[len(ar) - 2]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` updates the value of `res[i]`.
- `i` is `len(ar) - 2`.
- `mex` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]`.
- `ar[i]` is `ar[len(ar) - 2]`.
- Therefore, `res[i]` becomes `mex - ar[i]`, which simplifies to `(n - ar[len(ar) - 2]) - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, resulting in `n - 2 * ar[len(ar) - 2]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
