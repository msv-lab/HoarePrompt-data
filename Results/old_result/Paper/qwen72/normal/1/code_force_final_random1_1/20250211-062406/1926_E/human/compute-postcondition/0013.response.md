Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` and `k` are input integers, `n` must be non-zero and greater than 1, `L` is [m, m], `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now `n - m`, and `n` must be greater than 1 before the subtraction.**

Explanation:
- `m` is assigned the value `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The list `L` remains `[m, m]`.
- `n` is updated to `n - m`, which simplifies to `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
