The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`. The loop will continue to execute as long as the current value of `_` is less than the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1 again, and it must still be less than `t`.

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string, and the loop will continue to execute as long as the current value of `_` is less than the value of `t`.**
