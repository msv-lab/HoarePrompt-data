Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases and then iterating over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion Check**: The function checks if the promotional price for two yogurts (`b`) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`). This is done with the condition `if B * 2 < C:`. If true, it prints the total cost as `A * B`, which is the correct approach because buying each yogurt individually is cheaper.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts**: If the number of yogurts `A` is even and the promotional price is cheaper or equal to the regular price, the function prints the total cost as `int(A * C / 2)`. This is correct because it takes full advantage of the promotion.

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts**: If the number of yogurts `A` is odd, the function calculates the cost by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price and then buying one additional yogurt at the regular price. This is done with the calculation `X = A // 2` and `print(X * C + B)`. This is also correct because it minimizes the cost by using the promotion as much as possible and then adding the cost of the extra yogurt.

5. **Output**: The function prints the correct minimum cost for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above points, the function appears to handle all edge cases and logic correctly.

Correctness: **True**
