The only object in the loop head is the variable `c`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c` and the value of `cases`. If `c` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is equal to the number of cases processed so far. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be incremented by 1, and `cases` must still be greater than the new value of `c`.

State: **`pos_final` is decreased by the number of iterations, `total` is the cumulative sum of the smaller costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each iteration, `best` is the minimum value between the initial `best` and the sum of `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each iteration where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `v` is 0, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.**
