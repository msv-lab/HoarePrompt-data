Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2` (a floating-point number), `sl` is a list of characters from `s`.** 

Explanation: The code `sl = list(s)` converts the string `s` into a list of its characters and assigns it to the variable `sl`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`) remain unchanged.
