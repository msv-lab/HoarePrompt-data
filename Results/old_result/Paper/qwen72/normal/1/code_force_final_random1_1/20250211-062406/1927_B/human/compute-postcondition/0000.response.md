To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), representing the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of:
  - An integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).
  - A list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i < n).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`.
- For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
- The state before the loop starts includes `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Input Requirement**: The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`. This value must be greater than 0 for the loop to run at least once.
2. **Initial State**: The initial state includes `t`, `n`, and the list `a`. However, these values are not directly involved in the loop head.
3. **Adjustment Needed**: The only state that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the input value. Specifically, the input value must be greater than 0.

### Adjusted State:
- The input value must be greater than 0.
- The initial state of `t`, `n`, and `a` remains unchanged but is not directly relevant to the loop execution.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, and the input value must be greater than 0.**
