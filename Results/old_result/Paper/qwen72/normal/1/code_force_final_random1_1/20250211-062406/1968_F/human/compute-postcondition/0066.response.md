Output State: **`it2` is the index in `v2` where `r` would fit in order to maintain the sorted order of `v2`, decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged: `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would fit in order to maintain the sorted order of `v1`. `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[l - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not in `mp`. `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[r]` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not in `mp`. `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the same as initially assigned, `idx` is increased by `n + 6`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the corresponding integer value from `data` starting from `data[idx - n - 8]` to `data[idx - 7]`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index, `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values in `pf` and values being lists of indices where these `pf` values occur, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` is equal to 0, `results` includes the string 'YES'. If `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`, then `results` includes the string 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` includes both the strings 'YES' and 'NO'. `q` is decremented by 1. `results` now includes the string 'NO'.**
