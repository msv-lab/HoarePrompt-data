You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. x, y, and r are lists of integers where for each i (0 ≤ i < n), x[i] and y[i] are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x[i], y[i] ≤ 10^9, and r[i] is an integer such that 1 ≤ r[i] ≤ 10^9. visited is a list of booleans initialized to False for each element. coef is a list of None values, which will later be assigned integer values.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `i` is `n-1`.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list where all elements are `True`, `coef` is a list where each element is either 1 or another value depending on the DFS traversal, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` is the total count of nodes processed during the DFS traversals (specific value depends on the implementation), `bipartite` is `True` or `False` depending on whether the graph is bipartite, `ok` is `True` if the graph is bipartite and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` is `False`.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list where all elements are `True`, `coef` is a list where each element is either 1 or another value depending on the DFS traversal, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` is the total count of nodes processed during the DFS traversals (specific value depends on the implementation), `bipartite` is `True` or `False` depending on whether the graph is bipartite. If `ok` is `True`, the graph is bipartite and `tot` is not 0. If `ok` is `False`, the graph is not bipartite or `tot` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` based on the integer `n`, where `n` is the length of these lists. It updates the `visited` list to mark elements as visited and assigns integer values to the `coef` list.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
