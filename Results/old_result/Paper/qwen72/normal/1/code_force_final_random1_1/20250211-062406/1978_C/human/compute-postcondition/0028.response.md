Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `k` is now `(k // 2) - 2 * (n - 3) - n + 5`, `l` is the result of `func_3(3, l)`, `c` is 3, `i` is `n - 4`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer.
- The value of `k` is calculated using the expression `(k // 2) - 2 * (n - 3) - n + 5`.
- The value of `l` is updated to the result of calling `func_3(3, l)`, since `c` is 3.
- The value of `c` remains 3.
- The value of `i` remains `n - 4`.
