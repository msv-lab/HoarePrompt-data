Functionality: ** The function `func` interacts with a hidden permutation of integers from 0 to n-1 by making queries to determine the indices `i` and `j` such that the XOR of the elements at these indices in the permutation is maximized. It does this by performing at most 3n queries. The function handles multiple test cases, each with a different permutation, and outputs the indices `k` and `best` for each case, where `k` is the index that maximizes the bitwise OR operation with 0 among the indices 1 to n-1, and `best` is the index that maximizes the bitwise OR operation with `k` among the indices 0 to n-1. The function does not explicitly accept any parameters and does not return any values; instead, it prints the results directly. **
