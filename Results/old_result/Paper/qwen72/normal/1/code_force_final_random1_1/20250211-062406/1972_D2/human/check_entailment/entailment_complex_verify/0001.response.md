### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input.
     - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
     - It iterates over possible values of \(x\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
     - For each \(x\), it iterates over possible values of \(y\) starting from 1.
     - It checks if \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
     - If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments the counter `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
     - Finally, it prints the value of `cnt`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function reads the number of test cases \(t\).
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Input Handling**: The input handling is correct. It reads the number of test cases and the values of \(n\) and \(m\) for each test case.
   - **Condition Checking**: The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is correctly checked by ensuring \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and then counting the valid pairs.
   - **Efficiency**: The algorithm uses a nested loop with a complexity of \(O(\sqrt{n} \cdot \sqrt{m})\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\).
   - **Output**: The output is correctly printed for each test case.

4. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The function `func_1` correctly iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checks the conditions.
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

5. **Challenges to the Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment is thorough and accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - There are no logical errors or inefficiencies that would cause the program to fail for valid inputs within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is correct and should work as expected for the given problem description.

Final: **True**
