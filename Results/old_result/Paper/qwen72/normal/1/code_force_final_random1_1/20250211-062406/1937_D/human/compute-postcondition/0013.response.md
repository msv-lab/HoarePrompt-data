To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given State:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- If the first character of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is '>', then `idx_A` is a list containing `[0]`.
- If `len(idx_A) == 0`, then `A` is [0] and `idx_A` remains an empty list.
- Otherwise, `A` is a list containing one element `[x]`, `idx_A` is not empty, and `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 1] + (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
- If the first character of `s` is not '>', then `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged as empty lists.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The loop condition is `i < n`.

### Adjustments:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `n` must remain greater than the new value of `i` for the loop to continue.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

### After Increment:
- `i` becomes 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the first character of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is '>', then `idx_A` is a list containing `[0]`. If `len(idx_A) == 0`, then `A` is [0] and `idx_A` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `A` is a list containing one element `[x]`, `idx_A` is not empty, and `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 1] + (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`. If the first character of `s` is not '>', then `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged as empty lists.**
