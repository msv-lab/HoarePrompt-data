Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least one more character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the next character of `s` minus 97, `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`, `cnt` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cur` is updated by adding `1 << cur_ss` to its current value.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cur_ss`, `cnt`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the next character of `s` minus 97, and `1 << cur_ss` shifts the binary number 1 left by `cur_ss` positions.
- The new value of `cur` is `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`.
