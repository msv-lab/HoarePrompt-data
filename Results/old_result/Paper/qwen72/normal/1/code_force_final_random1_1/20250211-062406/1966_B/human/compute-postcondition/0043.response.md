Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 1, `m` is the input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`. If `impossible` is `True`, then `ans` is 'NO' and for all `i` from 0 to `n-2`, `gr[i][0] == gr[i + 1][0]` and `gr[i][m - 1] == gr[i + 1][m - 1]`. If `impossible` is `False`, then `ans` remains 'NO'.***
