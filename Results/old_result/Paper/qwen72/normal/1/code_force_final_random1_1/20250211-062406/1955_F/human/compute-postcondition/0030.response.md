The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part into an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This operation changes the value of `a` but does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `cnt` is `cnt + sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a)`, `x` is the last element of `a`**.
