To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, len(a)):
```

This means the loop will iterate over the range from 1 to `len(a) - 1` (inclusive). For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
- `len(a)` must be greater than 1, because the range `range(1, len(a))` requires `len(a)` to be at least 2 for the loop to have at least one iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9
- `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)
- `y` is an input integer
- `tt` is greater than 2
- `ii` is 2
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order
- `tmp` is an empty list
- `ans` is `x + y - 2`

We need to adjust the state to ensure that `len(a)` is at least 2. The variable `i` in the loop head is initialized to 1, and it will increment up to `len(a) - 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `a` must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is 1 (as it is the starting point of the loop).

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `tt`, `ii`, `tmp`, `ans`) do not affect the loop's execution directly and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `tmp` is an empty list, `ans` is `x + y - 2`**
