The code snippet `ans += int(g / count) + 1` updates the value of `ans` by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to its current value. Let's break down the impact:

- `n` is the first input integer.
- `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than or equal to 5.
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `count` is 4.
- `ans` is initially `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1 + int((int(n / 3) - 2) / 3) + 1`.
- `countmins` is 3.
- `g` is `int(n / 4) - 3`.

If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, since the code snippet only involves updating `ans`, we assume `g` is not less than `countmins` (otherwise, the code would not execute).

Let's calculate the new value of `ans`:

1. Calculate `int(g / count) + 1`:
   - `g` is `int(n / 4) - 3`.
   - `count` is 4.
   - `int(g / count)` is `int((int(n / 4) - 3) / 4)`.
   - Adding 1 gives `int((int(n / 4) - 3) / 4) + 1`.

2. Update `ans`:
   - Initial `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1 + int((int(n / 3) - 2) / 3) + 1`.
   - New `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1 + int((int(n / 3) - 2) / 3) + 1 + int((int(n / 4) - 3) / 4) + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than or equal to 5, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `count` is 4, `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1 + int((int(n / 3) - 2) / 3) + 1 + int((int(n / 4) - 3) / 4) + 1`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `int(n / 4) - 3`.**
