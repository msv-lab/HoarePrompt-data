The code snippet `z = arr[x:n - y]` extracts a substring from `arr` starting at the index `x` (the first occurrence of '1') up to, but not including, the index `n - y` (where `y` is the last occurrence of '1'). Here's the detailed calculation:

- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
- `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- The slice `arr[x:n - y]` starts at `x` and ends at `n - y`.

Let's consider the different scenarios:

1. If `x` and `y` are both valid indices (not `-1`), and `n - y` is greater than `x`, then `z` will be a substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1`.
2. If `n - y` is less than or equal to `x`, then `z` will be an empty string.
3. If `x` or `y` is `-1`, then `z` will be an empty string because the slicing operation will not be valid.

Given these considerations, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in `arr', `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in `arr', `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1` if `x` and `y` are valid and `n - y > x`, otherwise `z` is an empty string.**
