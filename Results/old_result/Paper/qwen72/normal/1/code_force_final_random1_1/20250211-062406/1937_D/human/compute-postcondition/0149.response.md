To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `j` is equal to `n`.
- `i` is 1.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order.
- `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is '>' or not.
- `r` is the length of `B` minus 1.
- The values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions described in the if-else part.

### Expression to Evaluate:
```python
print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`**: 
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Value of `n`**:
   - `n` is greater than 1, but the exact value is not specified. Let's denote it as `n`.

3. **Value of `l`**:
   - `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is '>' or not. Since `i` is 1, `s[1]` is the second character of the string `s`.
   - If `s[1]` is '>', then `l` is 1.
   - If `s[1]` is not '>', then `l` is 0.

4. **Value of `idx_A[l - 1]`**:
   - `idx_A` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is likely related to the indices of some characters in the string `s`.
   - If `l` is 1, then `idx_A[l - 1]` is `idx_A[0]`, which is the first element of `idx_A`.
   - If `l` is 0, then `idx_A[l - 1]` would be out of bounds (since `l - 1` would be -1), which suggests that `l` must be 1 for this expression to be valid.

5. **Expression Calculation**:
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`.
   - Substituting the known values:
     - `i` is 1.
     - `l` is 1 (assuming `s[1]` is '>').
     - `idx_A[l - 1]` is `idx_A[0]`.

   Therefore, the expression becomes:
   \[
   n - 1 + (1 - idx_A[0]) * 2
   \]

6. **Simplifying the Expression**:
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     n - 1 + 2 - 2 \cdot idx_A[0]
     \]
     \[
     n + 1 - 2 \cdot idx_A[0]
     \]

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of the expression `n + 1 - 2 * idx_A[0]`.

Output: **n + 1 - 2 * idx_A[0]** (where `n` is the value of `n` and `idx_A[0]` is the first element of the `idx_A` list)
