Let's break down the initial state and the logic leading up to the `print` statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- If `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are set to `a // 2`.
- If `a1` is not equal to `b`, the current iteration is skipped.
- If `a` is odd, the conditions for continuing to the next iteration of the loop remain unchanged.
- `b1` is set to `b // 2`.
- `b2` is set to `b // 2`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for `a` being even:**
   - If `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are both set to `a // 2`.
   - The code checks if `a1` is not equal to `b`. If this condition is true, the current iteration is skipped.

2. **Condition for `a` being odd:**
   - If `a` is odd, the conditions for continuing to the next iteration of the loop remain unchanged. This means the loop continues without any specific action related to `a1` and `b`.

3. **Setting `b1` and `b2`:**
   - Regardless of whether `a` is even or odd, `b1` and `b2` are always set to `b // 2`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print('Yes')` statement is executed after the above conditions are met.

### Conclusion:
- The `print('Yes')` statement will always print "Yes" because it does not depend on any conditional logic that would prevent it from executing. The conditions described in the initial state do not affect the execution of the `print` statement directly.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
