Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is greater than 1, `t1` is `(a[1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[0] + 2) % n`. If `t1` is not in the set `st` and `t2` is in the set `st`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is still 1.
- The value of `x` is still greater than 1.
- The value of `t1` is updated to `(a[1] + 1) % n`.
- The value of `t2` remains `(a[0] + 2) % n`.
- The condition for updating `ans` remains the same: if `t1` is not in the set `st` and `t2` is in the set `st`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
