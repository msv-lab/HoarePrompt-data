The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`, and the parameters of the `range` function. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the range starts from 1 and increments by 2. For the loop to execute, `i` should start at 1 (the first odd number), and `n` should be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the new integer input by the user that must be greater than 1, `a` is the new string input by the user, `b` is the new string input by the user, and `i` is 1**
