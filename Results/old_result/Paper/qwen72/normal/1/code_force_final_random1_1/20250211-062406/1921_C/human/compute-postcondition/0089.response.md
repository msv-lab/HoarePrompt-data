Postcondition: ***`array2` is an empty list or contains one element, which is the result of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` and is less than `b`. `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). `test_cases` must be greater than `n + 1`. `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, where `n` is the first element and must be greater than 0, `f` is the second element, `a` is the third element, and `b` is the last element. `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input. `i` is not 0. If the difference between the current element `arr[i]` and the previous element `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains one element, otherwise, `array2` remains empty.***
