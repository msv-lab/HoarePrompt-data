Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None`, `mex` is now equal to `n - 2 * ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `ar[len(ar) - 2]` is greater than 0, `res[i]` is `n - 2 * ar[len(ar) - 2]`.**

Explanation:
- `mex` was initially `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]`.
- The code `mex = mex - ar[i]` updates `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from its current value.
- Since `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `ar[i]` is `ar[len(ar) - 2]`.
- Therefore, `mex` becomes `n - ar[len(ar) - 2] - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, which simplifies to `n - 2 * ar[len(ar) - 2]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
