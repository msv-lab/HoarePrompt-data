You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers where 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the last input, and `m` is the second integer from the last input. The values of `n` and `m` will depend on the final input provided during the last iteration of the loop. If `n` == `m`, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. If `m` > `n`, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. If `m` <= `n`, and specifically if `m` equals `n - 1`, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. If `m` does not equal `n - 1`, the values of `n` and `m` are maintained regardless of whether they are even or odd.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is done using a loop that iterates `t` times.

2. **Parsing Input**: For each test case, the program parses two integers `n` and `m` from the input. This is done correctly using list comprehension.

3. **Conditions**:
   - **Condition 1**: `if n == m:` This checks if the number of moves `n` is equal to the desired number of cubes `m`. If true, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can simply add one cube per move.
   - **Condition 2**: `elif m > n:` This checks if the desired number of cubes `m` is greater than the number of moves `n`. If true, it prints 'No' because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
   - **Condition 3**: `elif m == n - 1:` This checks if the desired number of cubes `m` is one less than the number of moves `n`. If true, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can add one cube in each move except the last one.
   - **Condition 4**: `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:` This checks if both `m` and `n` are even. If true, it prints 'Yes' because an even number of moves can result in an even number of cubes.
   - **Condition 5**: `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:` This checks if both `m` and `n` are odd. If true, it prints 'Yes' because an odd number of moves can result in an odd number of cubes.
   - **Else**: If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'No'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `m` is greater than `n` or when `m` and `n` have different parities correctly.

5. **Output**: The program outputs 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case, which matches the problem requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to handle all the specified conditions and edge cases correctly.
