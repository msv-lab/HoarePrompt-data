The code snippet `ql = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the user input to the variable `ql`. This operation does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input split by spaces, `len(b)` is greater than or equal to 1, `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `a` has at least `len(b) + (len(a) - 1)` elements, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `m` is 0, `ql` is an input integer.**
