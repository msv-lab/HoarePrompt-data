### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the score by selecting pairs of numbers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score.
   - The goal is to ensure that we always pick the smallest possible number in each pair to maximize the overall score.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - It sorts the list of integers. Sorting ensures that the smallest numbers are considered first, which is crucial for maximizing the score.
   - The program then iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element starting from the first (index 0). This is because, in a sorted list, the smallest elements will be at even indices when considering pairs.
   - The sum of these elements (which are the minimums of the pairs) is added to the score.
   - Finally, the score is printed for each test case.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **Sorting**: Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are considered first, which is necessary for maximizing the score.
   - **Pair Selection**: By iterating through the sorted list and taking every second element, the program correctly selects the minimum of each pair.
   - **Score Calculation**: The score is calculated by summing the selected elements, which are the minimums of the pairs.
   - **Test Cases**: The program handles multiple test cases correctly by using a loop to process each test case independently.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the smallest possible input (n=1) correctly.
   - It also handles larger inputs (up to the constraints) correctly by sorting and selecting the appropriate elements.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **Initial State**: Before the function call, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, representing the number of test cases.
- **Loop over Test Cases**: The outer loop runs `t` times, processing each test case independently.
- **Reading Input**: For each test case, `n` is read, and a list of `2n` integers is read and sorted.
- **Score Initialization**: `score` is initialized to 0.
- **Iterating and Summing**: The inner loop iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element starting from the first (index 0), and adds it to `score`.
- **Printing the Score**: After the inner loop completes, the score is printed for the current test case.
- **Final State**: After all iterations, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the final input, `score` is the sum of every second element starting from the first element in `l` up to the last even-indexed element within the range of `2 * n`, `i` is `2 * n`, and `2 * n` is greater than 0. The loop has completed all its iterations for all `t` test cases.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It sorts the list, selects the minimums of the pairs, and calculates the score accurately.

### Correctness:
