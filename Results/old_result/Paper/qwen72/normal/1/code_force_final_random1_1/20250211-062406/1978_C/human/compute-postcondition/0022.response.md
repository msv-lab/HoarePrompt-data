Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `k` is now `(k // 2) - 2 * (n - 3)`, `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`, `c` is 3, `i` is `n - 4`, and `k` is still greater than or equal to `i - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `l`, `i`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions.
