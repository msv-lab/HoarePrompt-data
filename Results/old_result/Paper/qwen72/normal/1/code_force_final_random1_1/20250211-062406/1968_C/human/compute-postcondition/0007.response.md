The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros except `a[0]` which is 1000 and `a[1]` which is 1000 + `x[0]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
