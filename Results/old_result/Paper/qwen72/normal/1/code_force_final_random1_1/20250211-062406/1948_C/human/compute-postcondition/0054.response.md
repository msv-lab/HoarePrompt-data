Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the new integer input by the user, `a` is the new string input by the user, `b` is the new string input by the user, and `i` is the last odd number less than `n`. The loop has completed all iterations without breaking, and the final value of `i` is the largest odd number less than `n`. If the loop did not break due to the condition `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program will print 'yes'.**
