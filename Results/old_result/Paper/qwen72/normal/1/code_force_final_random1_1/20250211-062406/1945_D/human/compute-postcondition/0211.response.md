To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object `custos` in the loop head. The loop will iterate over each element in the `custos` list. For the loop to execute, `custos` must contain at least one element.

Given the state before the loop starts, we know that after the loop has executed all iterations, `custos` is a list containing the calculated costs for each of the `t` test cases. This implies that `custos` should already have elements if the previous part of the program has run correctly.

However, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to explicitly state that `custos` must have at least one element. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `i`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `nf`, `y`) remain unchanged and are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.
