The code snippet updates the value of `k` by subtracting `i` and adding 1. Let's break down the changes:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - `k` is now `(k // 2) - 2 * (n - 3)`.
   - `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`.
   - `c` is 3.
   - `i` is `n - 4`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - `k = k - i + 1`

3. **Impact:**
   - The new value of `k` is calculated as `k - i + 1`.
   - Substituting the initial value of `i` (which is `n - 4`), the new value of `k` becomes:
     \[
     k = ((k // 2) - 2 * (n - 3)) - (n - 4) + 1
     \]
   - Simplifying the expression:
     \[
     k = (k // 2) - 2 * (n - 3) - n + 4 + 1
     \]
     \[
     k = (k // 2) - 2 * (n - 3) - n + 5
     \]

4. **Output State:**
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - `k` is now `(k // 2) - 2 * (n - 3) - n + 5`.
   - `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`.
   - `c` is 3.
   - `i` is `n - 4`.

Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer, `k` is now `(k // 2) - 2 * (n - 3) - n + 5`, `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`, `c` is 3, and `i` is `n - 4`.**
