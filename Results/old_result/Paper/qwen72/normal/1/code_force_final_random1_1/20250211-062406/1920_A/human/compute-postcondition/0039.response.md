Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` and `v` are integers from the input, `start` remains unchanged or is updated to `v` if `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`, `end` is updated to `v` if `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, and `num` remains unchanged unless `t` is 3, in which case `num` now includes `v` as its last element.***
