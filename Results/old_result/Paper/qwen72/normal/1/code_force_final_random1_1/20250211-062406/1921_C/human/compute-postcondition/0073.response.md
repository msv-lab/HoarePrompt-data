Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will have iterated through all values from 0 to `test_cases - 1`. For each iteration, `feat` will be updated with the new input values, and `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` will be set based on the current `feat`. The list `arr` will be populated with the new input values for each test case. The list `array2` will be recalculated for each test case, containing the values `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for all `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` where the condition `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) < b / a` is true. The final output for each test case will be 'Yes' if the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, otherwise 'No'. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**
