To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `j` is equal to `n`.
- `i` is 1.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order.
- `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is '>' or not.
- `r` is the length of `B` minus 1.
- `a` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.

### Variables Involved in the Print Statement:
- `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.

2. **Value of `a`:**
   - `a` is calculated as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
   - Since `i` is 1, we need to determine `l` and `idx_A[l - 1]`.
   - `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is '>' or not.
   - If `s[i]` is '>', then `l` is 1.
   - If `s[i]` is not '>', then `l` is 0.
   - Let's assume `s[i]` is '>', so `l` is 1.
   - Therefore, `a` becomes `A[1 - 1] + (1 - idx_A[1 - 1]) * 1`, which simplifies to `A[0] + (1 - idx_A[0])`.

3. **Value of `b`:**
   - `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
   - Since `i` is 1 and `l` is 1, `b` becomes `b + (idx_B[r] - 1) * 1`, which simplifies to `b + (idx_B[r] - 1)`.

4. **Final Expression:**
   - The expression to be printed is `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.
   - Substituting the values:
     - `a` is `A[0] + (1 - idx_A[0])`.
     - `b` is `b + (idx_B[r] - 1)`.
     - `i` is 1.
   - Therefore, the expression becomes:
     \[
     (A[0] + (1 - idx_A[0])) * 2 + (b + (idx_B[r] - 1)) * 2 + 1 + 1
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     2A[0] + 2(1 - idx_A[0]) + 2b + 2(idx_B[r] - 1) + 2
     \]
   - Combining like terms:
     \[
     2A[0] + 2 - 2idx_A[0] + 2b + 2idx_B[r] - 2 + 2
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     2A[0] - 2idx_A[0] + 2b + 2idx_B[r] + 2
     \]

### Final Output:
The exact numerical value of the expression depends on the specific values of `A[0]`, `idx_A[0]`, `b`, and `idx_B[r]`. However, based on the given information, the print statement will output the result of the expression `2A[0] - 2idx_A[0] + 2b + 2idx_B[r] + 2`.

Output: **2A[0] - 2idx_A[0] + 2b + 2idx_B[r] + 2 (where A[0] is the first element of A, idx_A[0] is the first element of idx_A, b is the value of b, and idx_B[r] is the last element of idx_B)**
