The only object in the loop head is the range generated by `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by the user input. Since the loop is controlled by the number of iterations specified by the user, and there are no other variables or conditions in the loop head that need to be adjusted, the state does not change in terms of the loop control.

However, since the task specifies that we should adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, and given that the loop is controlled by an external input, the state remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, but the loop is ready to execute again if the user provides a positive integer.

State: **All elements in `b_values` have been processed, and `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for every `i` in `b_values`.**
