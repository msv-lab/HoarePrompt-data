The only variable in the loop head is `_` (the loop counter) and `t` (the number of iterations). The loop counter `_` is not explicitly tracked or modified outside of the loop's control structure, so we focus on `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be at least 1 at the start of the next iteration. However, since the loop counter `_` is incremented implicitly by the loop, we don't need to adjust it directly. The key is to ensure that `t` is still greater than 0.

Given that the loop has already run once, `t` was at least 1 at the end of the previous iteration. For the loop to continue, `t` must be at least 1 again at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer.**
