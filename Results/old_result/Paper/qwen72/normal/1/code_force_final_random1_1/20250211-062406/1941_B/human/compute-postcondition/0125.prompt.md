Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` is an integer where 1 ≤ numTest ≤ 10^4, for each test case, `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of elements in the array. The array `a` consists of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(0, numTest):
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    stop = False
    for i in range(0, n - 2):
        if a[i] < 0:
            print('NO')
            stop = True
            break
        opNum = a[i]
        a[i] -= opNum
        a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
        a[i + 2] -= opNum
    if stop == True:
        continue
    if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `numTest` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is equal to `a[n-3]`, `a[n-3]` has been updated to `0`, `a[n-2]` has been updated to `a[n-2] - 2 * opNum`, `a[n-1]` has been updated to `a[n-1] - opNum`. If `stop` is set to True, at least one element in `a` became less than 0 during the loop execution, and the loop skips the rest of its body and moves to the next iteration. Additionally, either the last element of `a` (`a[len(a) - 1]`) is not 0 or the second-to-last element of `a` (`a[len(a) - 2]`) is not 0, or both `a[len(a) - 1]` and `a[len(a) - 2]` are 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *The loop will terminate when `i` reaches `n - 3` or when `a[i]` becomes less than 0 for any `i`. The final state of the array `a` will depend on the values of `a` and the number of iterations. Specifically, `a[i]` will be updated as follows: `a[i] -= a[i]`, `a[i + 1] -= 2 * a[i]`, and `a[i + 2] -= a[i]` for each iteration `i` from 0 to `n - 3`. If any `a[i]` becomes less than 0 during the process, the loop will break, and `stop` will be set to True. If `stop` is True, it indicates that the loop has terminated due to an element in `a` becoming less than 0. If `stop` is False, it indicates that the loop completed normally without any element in `a` becoming less than 0. Additionally, either the last element of `a` (`a[len(a) - 1]`) is not 0, or the second-to-last element of `a` (`a[len(a) - 2]`) is not 0, or both are 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`numTest` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input with the first `n-2` elements now equal to 0, `a[n-1]` and `a[n]` are unchanged, `i` is `n-3`, `opNum` is 0. If `stop` is True, we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged. Additionally, either `a[len(a) - 1]` is not 0 or `a[len(a) - 2]` is not 0, or both `a[len(a) - 1]` and `a[len(a) - 2]` are 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
