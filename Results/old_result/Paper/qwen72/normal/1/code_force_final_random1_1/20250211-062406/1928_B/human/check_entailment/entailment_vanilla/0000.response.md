### Reasoning:

The provided program does not directly address the problem statement. Instead, it defines several functions that seem unrelated to the task at hand. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads an integer from input.
   - `func_2()`: Reads a list of integers from input.
   - `func_3()`: Reads a list of integers from input and returns it as a list.
   - `func_4()`: Reads a list of integers from input, sorts it, and returns it.
   - `func_5()`: Reads a list of strings from input.
   - `func_6()`: Reads a string from input and returns it as a list of characters.
   - `func_7()`: Reads a list of strings from input, sorts it, and returns it.
   - `func_8(arr)`: Computes the cumulative product of elements in a list.
   - `func_9(arr)`: Computes the cumulative product of elements in a list in reverse order.

2. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The problem requires determining the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation to the array.
   - This involves understanding the distribution of elements in the array and how adding a permutation can affect this distribution.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The provided functions do not perform any operations related to the problem's requirements.
   - There is no logic to handle multiple test cases, read the array, add a permutation, or count the frequency of elements.
   - The functions `func_8` and `func_9` compute cumulative products, which are not relevant to the problem of finding the maximum number of equal elements after adding a permutation.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not solve the problem as described. It lacks the necessary logic to handle the input, process the array, and produce the correct output.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
