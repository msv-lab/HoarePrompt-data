To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `a` is equal to `A[l]`
- `j` is equal to `n`
- `i` is 2
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order
- `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop
- `l` is 0
- `r` is the length of `B` minus 1
- `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * 1`

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `a`:**
   - `a` is equal to `A[l]`
   - Given `l` is 0, `a` is the first element of the list `A`.

2. **Determine `b`:**
   - `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * 1`
   - `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, so `r - 1` is the second-to-last index of `B`.
   - `idx_B[r - 1]` is the second-to-last index of `<` in the string `s`.
   - `b` is then calculated as `(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * 1`.

3. **Determine the expression inside the `print` statement:**
   - The expression is `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`
   - Substitute the known values:
     - `a` is the first element of `A`
     - `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * 1`
     - `i` is 2

4. **Calculate the final value:**
   - Let's denote the first element of `A` as `A[0]`.
   - Let's denote the second-to-last index of `<` in `s` as `idx_B[r - 1]`.
   - The expression becomes:
     \[
     2 \times A[0] + 2 \times (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) + 2 + 1
     \]
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     2A[0] + 2(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) + 3
     \]
     \[
     2A[0] + 2idx_B[r - 1] - 4 + 3
     \]
     \[
     2A[0] + 2idx_B[r - 1] - 1
     \]

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `2A[0] + 2idx_B[r - 1] - 1` followed by a space.

Output: **2A[0] + 2idx_B[r - 1] - 1 (where A[0] is the first element of the list A and idx_B[r - 1] is the second-to-last index of '<' in the string s)**
