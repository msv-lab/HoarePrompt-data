Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in an order determined by the characters in `s`, `l` is `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', otherwise it is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is -1 if all characters in `s` are 'R', otherwise it is `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in `s`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being the cumulative product of the elements in `b` from the last to the current index, modulo `m`, and `p` is the final cumulative product of all elements in `b`, modulo `m`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the elements of `b` in reverse order.
- For each iteration, `p` is updated by multiplying the current value of `p` with the current element `v` from `b`, and then taking the result modulo `m`.
- The updated value of `p` is appended to the list `ans`.
- After all iterations, `ans` contains `n` elements, each representing the cumulative product of the elements in `b` from the last to the current index, modulo `m`.
- The final value of `p` is the cumulative product of all elements in `b`, modulo `m`.
