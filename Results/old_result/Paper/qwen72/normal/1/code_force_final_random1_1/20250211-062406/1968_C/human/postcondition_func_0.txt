The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it generates a list `a` of length `n` where `a[0]` is always 1000, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is calculated as `1000 + sum(x[:i])`. The function prints the list `a` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
