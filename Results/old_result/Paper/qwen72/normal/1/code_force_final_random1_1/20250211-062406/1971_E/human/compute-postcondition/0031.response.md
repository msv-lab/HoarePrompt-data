Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers provided by the user input where `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations plus 1, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user from the second input, `ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b` for all elements in `b` except the last one, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `len(b)` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, `v` is a list containing 0 followed by the values `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., up to `ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]`, `l` is 0, `m` is 0.**
