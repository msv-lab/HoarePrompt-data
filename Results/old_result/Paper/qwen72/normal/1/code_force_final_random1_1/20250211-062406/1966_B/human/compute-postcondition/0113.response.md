Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input (greater than 1), `m` is the second integer from the input (greater than 1), `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is a user's input), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, `ans` is 'YES', the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`. If any of the conditions `gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]` were true for any `j` in the range `0` to `m-2`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range `0` to `m-2` (inclusive).
- For each iteration, the loop checks if the elements `gr[0][j]` and `gr[0][j + 1]` are not equal, or if the elements `gr[n - 1][j]` and `gr[n - 1][j + 1]` are not equal.
- If either condition is true for any `j`, the variable `impossible` is set to `False`.
- After all iterations, if none of the conditions were met, `impossible` remains `True`.
- The variables `t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
