Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, and `m` is the second integer from the new input. If both `m` and `n` are odd, the program does not change the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`. Otherwise, the program does not change the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`.***
