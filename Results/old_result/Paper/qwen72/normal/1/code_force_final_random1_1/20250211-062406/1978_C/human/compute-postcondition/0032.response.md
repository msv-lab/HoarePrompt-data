The code `l.pop(-1)` removes the last element from the list `l`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `i` is `n - 3`
- `k` is `k - n + 3`
- `1 + i` is less than or equal to `k`
- The list `l` now has `x` inserted at the beginning and the last two elements removed
- `x` is no longer the last element of `l`
- If `k` is 0, the list `l` is returned as is, but with `x` no longer being the last element
- If `1 + i` is greater than `k` and `k` is not 0, `x` is also inserted at the position `-k` in the list `l`
- `x` is the last element of the list `l`

After executing `l.pop(-1)`, the last element of the list `l` is removed. Since `x` was the last element of `l`, it is no longer in the list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 3`, `k` is `k - n + 3`, `1 + i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` now has `x` inserted at the beginning and the last three elements removed, and `x` is no longer in the list `l`. If `k` is 0, the list `l` is returned as is, but with `x` no longer being the last element. If `1 + i` is greater than `k` and `k` is not 0, `x` is also inserted at the position `-k` in the list `l`.**
