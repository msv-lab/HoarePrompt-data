To determine what will be printed by the `print(c)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context:

### Initial State:
- `custos` is a list containing the calculated costs for each of the `t` test cases.
- The list `custos` must have at least three elements.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(c)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `c` is not explicitly defined in the provided initial state or code snippet.
- Since `c` is not defined, it is not clear what value it holds.
- In Python, if a variable is used without being defined, it will raise a `NameError`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `c` is not defined in the provided context, the `print(c)` statement will result in a `NameError`.

Output: **NameError (since `c` is not defined)**
