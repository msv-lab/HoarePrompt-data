To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the user.
   - `x` is the smallest integer such that `x * x > n`.
   - `y` is 1.
   - `cnt` is the total count of valid `(x, y)` pairs where:
     - `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` (i.e., `x` and `y` are coprime).
     - `(x + y) * x <= n`.
     - `(x + y) * y <= m`.

2. **Explanation:**
   - The value of `x` is determined by finding the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`.
   - The value of `y` is fixed at 1.
   - The variable `cnt` counts the number of valid pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy the given conditions.

3. **Conditions for Valid Pairs:**
   - `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`: Since `y` is 1, this condition is always true because the greatest common divisor (GCD) of any integer and 1 is 1.
   - `(x + y) * x <= n`: This simplifies to `(x + 1) * x <= n`.
   - `(x + y) * y <= m`: This simplifies to `(x + 1) * 1 <= m`, or `x + 1 <= m`.

4. **Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - For each `x` that satisfies `x * x > n`, check if `(x + 1) * x <= n` and `x + 1 <= m`.
   - If both conditions are met, increment `cnt`.

Given these conditions, the value of `cnt` will be the number of valid `x` values that meet the criteria.

**Final Output:**
The `print(cnt)` statement will print the total count of valid `(x, y)` pairs where `x` is the smallest integer such that `x * x > n`, `y` is 1, and the pairs satisfy the conditions `(x + 1) * x <= n` and `x + 1 <= m`.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the total count of valid (x, y) pairs meeting the specified conditions)**
