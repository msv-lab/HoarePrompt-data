Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is the logarithm base 2 of an input integer.
   - `power` is equal to `n`.
   - The current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2 ** power)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `n` is the logarithm base 2 of an input integer. This means if the input integer is `x`, then `n = log2(x)`.
   - `power` is set to `n`, so `power = n`.
   - The expression `2 ** power` is equivalent to `2 ** n`.
   - Since `n = log2(x)`, the expression `2 ** n` simplifies to `2 ** log2(x)`, which is equal to `x`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of the input integer `x`.

Output: **x (where x is the input integer whose logarithm base 2 is n)**
