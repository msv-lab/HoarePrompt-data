The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute another iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and `func_1()` has been called. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0, but since the loop counter `_` is not used, it does not change the state of `t`. However, the loop itself decrements an implicit counter that is based on `t`.

Since the loop counter is decremented by 1 each time the loop runs, for the loop to execute again, `t` must now be greater than 1 (because the loop has already run once, reducing the initial `t` by 1).

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `func_1()` has been called.**
