Postcondition: ***`x` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `n` is updated to the value provided by the input, `q` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`, and the value of `t` remains unchanged. If `x % i == 0` and `(x - n * (x // i))` is non-negative, divisible by `(x // i)`, and `x // i` is greater than 0, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value (1) and `x`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.***
