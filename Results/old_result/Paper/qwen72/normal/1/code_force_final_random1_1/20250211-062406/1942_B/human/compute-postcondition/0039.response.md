To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
   - `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`.
   - `mex` is now equal to `n - sum(ar)`.
   - The variable `i` is `-1` after the loop has completed all its iterations.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` is the length of the list `ar`.
   - `ar` is a list of integers.
   - `mex` is calculated as `n - sum(ar)`.
   - `res` is a list where each element `res[i]` is computed as `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Calculating `mex`:**
   - `mex` is the difference between `n` and the sum of all elements in `ar`.
   - For example, if `n = 5` and `ar = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `sum(ar) = 15` and `mex = 5 - 15 = -10`.

4. **Constructing `res`:**
   - Each element `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`.
   - Continuing the example, if `mex = -10` and `ar = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then:
     - `res[0] = -10 - 1 = -11`
     - `res[1] = -10 - 2 = -12`
     - `res[2] = -10 - 3 = -13`
     - `res[3] = -10 - 4 = -14`
     - `res[4] = -10 - 5 = -15`
   - Therefore, `res` would be `[-11, -12, -13, -14, -15]`.

5. **Printing `res`:**
   - The `print` statement converts each element of `res` to a string and joins them with spaces.
   - For the example, the output would be `-11 -12 -13 -14 -15`.

6. **General Case:**
   - The output will be a space-separated list of integers where each integer is `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **`mex - ar[0] mex - ar[1] ... mex - ar[n-1]` (where `mex` is `n - sum(ar)`)**
