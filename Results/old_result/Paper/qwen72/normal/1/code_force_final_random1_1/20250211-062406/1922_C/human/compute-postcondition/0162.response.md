Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
- `m` is a new input integer and must be greater than 1.
- `j` is 1.
- `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by the user input.
- `d1` is a dictionary that will contain keys from 2 to `n` with values determined by the loop logic.
- `d2` is a `defaultdict` initialized with the default factory `int` and contains the key `n - 1` with the value 1.
- `x` and `y` are now updated to the new pair of integers provided by the user input.
- If the new `y` > new `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(d2[y] - d2[x])
```

### Analysis:
1. **`d2` Initialization**:
   - `d2` is a `defaultdict` with the default factory `int`, meaning any key that does not exist in `d2` will return 0.
   - `d2` contains the key `n - 1` with the value 1.

2. **Values of `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by the user input.
   - If the new `y` > new `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

3. **Accessing `d2`**:
   - When accessing `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`, if `y` or `x` is not a key in `d2`, the default value 0 will be returned.
   - The only key in `d2` that we know for sure is `n - 1` with the value 1.

4. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - If `y == n - 1` and `x` is not `n - 1`, then `d2[y]` will be 1 and `d2[x]` will be 0.
   - If `x == n - 1` and `y` is not `n - 1`, then `d2[y]` will be 0 and `d2[x]` will be 1.
   - If neither `y` nor `x` is `n - 1`, both `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` will be 0.

### Conclusion:
- If `y == n - 1` and `x` is not `n - 1`, the output will be `1 - 0 = 1`.
- If `x == n - 1` and `y` is not `n - 1`, the output will be `0 - 1 = -1`.
- If neither `y` nor `x` is `n - 1`, the output will be `0 - 0 = 0`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 if y == n - 1 and x is not n - 1, -1 if x == n - 1 and y is not n - 1, 0 otherwise**.
