Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is equal to `m`, `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with all elements processed, `p` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative sum of elements in `l`, `c` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative count of `1`s encountered in `l`, `i` is the count of `1`s in the last processed sublist `l[a:b+1]`, `j` is the total count of `1`s in `l`, `a` and `b` are the last input values for the indices, `s` is the sum of elements in the last processed sublist `l[a:b+1]`. The loop has completed all `m` iterations, and the conditions for each iteration have been checked and printed accordingly.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `_` will be equal to `m`, indicating that the loop has run the specified number of times. The lists `l`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are initialized before the loop and not modified within it. The variables `a` and `b` hold the last set of indices used in the loop, and `i` and `s` hold the results of the last iteration's calculations. The conditions for each iteration have been evaluated, and the appropriate 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed for each.
