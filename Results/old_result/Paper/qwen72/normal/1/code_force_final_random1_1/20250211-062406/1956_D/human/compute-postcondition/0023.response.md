Functionality: ** The function `recursive_maximize_sum` takes two parameters, `l` and `r`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), where `a` is a list of integers. The function modifies the list `a` and the list `ops`. If the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r+1]` is less than or equal to the square of the length of this sublist, the function updates the sublist `a[l:r+1]` to contain only the value of the length of the sublist, and appends the tuple `(l, r)` to the list `ops`. If the sum is greater, the function recursively processes the left and right sublists around the maximum element in the sublist `a[l:r+1]`. The function does not return any value. After the function completes, the list `a` will have been modified according to the rules described, and the list `ops` will contain tuples representing the ranges of indices that were processed. **
