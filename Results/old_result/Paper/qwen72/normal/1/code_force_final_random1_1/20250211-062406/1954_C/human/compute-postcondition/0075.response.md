Postcondition: ***After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are still strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The lists `a` and `b` are unchanged, containing the digits from the input strings `x` and `y`, respectively. If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, the list `new` contains the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices up to `i-1`, and the remaining elements are `None`. Similarly, the list `new2` contains the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices up to `i-1`, and the remaining elements are `None`. If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, the list `new` contains the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices, and there are no `None` values left. The list `new2` contains the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices, and there are no `None` values left.***
