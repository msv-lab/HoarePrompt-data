Output State: **All elements in `b_values` have been processed, and for each element `i` in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0 except for `cnt_b[b[0]]` which is now 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is now 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt_b[b[1]]` by 1, since `i` is 1. Initially, `cnt_b[b[1]]` was 0, so after the increment, it becomes 1. The rest of the state remains unchanged.
