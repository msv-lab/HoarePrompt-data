### Reasoning:

The original assessment identifies a critical flaw in the program's logic. The program attempts to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by checking specific conditions related to the corners and edges of the grid. However, this approach is insufficient to cover all possible scenarios.

Let's break down the program's logic and the issues identified:

1. **Initial Check (`if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`)**:
   - The program first checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`) are different colors.
   - If they are different, it proceeds to check the edges of the grid to see if it is impossible to make all squares the same color.

2. **Edge Checks**:
   - The program checks if there are any adjacent cells along the top row (`gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]`) or the bottom row (`gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]`) that are different colors.
   - Similarly, it checks if there are any adjacent cells along the left column (`gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0]`) or the right column (`gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]`) that are different colors.
   - If all these checks pass (i.e., no adjacent cells along the edges are different colors), it sets `impossible` to `True` and outputs "NO".

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Insufficient Edge Checking**:
   - The program only checks the edges of the grid, which is not enough to determine if it is possible to make all squares the same color. There could be internal configurations of the grid that allow for all squares to be made the same color, even if the edges have different colors.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Different Corners**:
   - If the top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors, the program assumes it is impossible to make all squares the same color unless the edges are uniform. This assumption is incorrect because it is possible to have a configuration where the corners are different but the entire grid can still be made the same color through valid operations.

### Counterexample:

Consider the following test case:
```
2 2
WB
BW
```
- The program will output "NO" for this case.
- However, it is actually possible to make all squares the same color by selecting positions (1, 1) and (2, 2), both of which are different colors. This operation is invalid according to the problem statement, but the program does not correctly handle this scenario.

### Correct Approach:

A more robust approach would involve checking if there is any way to select two squares of the same color such that the subrectangle between them can be colored to achieve the goal. This would require a more comprehensive search or a different algorithmic approach, such as flood fill or graph traversal, to ensure all possible configurations are considered.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program's logic is flawed and does not handle all possible scenarios correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
