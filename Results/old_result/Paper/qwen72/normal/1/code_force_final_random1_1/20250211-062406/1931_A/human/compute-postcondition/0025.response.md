Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `word` is an empty string.** 

The code snippet assigns an empty string to the variable `word`. Since `word` was already an empty string in the initial state, its value remains unchanged. The values of `i` and `n` are not affected by this code snippet.
