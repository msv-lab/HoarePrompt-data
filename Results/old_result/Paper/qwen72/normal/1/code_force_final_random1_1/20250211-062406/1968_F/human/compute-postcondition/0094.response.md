Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and must be at least 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2) + 3`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `a[1]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `{0: [0]}`, `results` contains the final results of the loop's operations ('YES' or 'NO' for each iteration), the last element of `results` is an empty string, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- `idx` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `idx` is `q * (n + 2) + 3`.
- The value of `n` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` because `idx` was previously increased by `q * (n + 2) + 2` and is now further increased by 1.
- The value of `q` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 2]` because `idx` was previously increased by `q * (n + 2) + 2` and is now further increased by 1.
- The value of `a[1]` is now `int(data[idx - 1])` because `idx` was previously increased by `q * (n + 2) + 2` and is now further increased by 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
