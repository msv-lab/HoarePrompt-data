Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `i` is `m-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates `m` times, with `i` starting at 0 and incrementing by 1 each iteration until it reaches `m-1`.
- For each iteration, the value at index `b[i]` in the `cnt_b` list is incremented by 1.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `m-1`, indicating the last iteration has been completed.
- The `cnt_b` list will have been updated such that for each index `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, the value `cnt_b[b[j]]` will have been incremented by 1.
- The variables `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
