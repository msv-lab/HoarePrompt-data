Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `best` is 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will output a string starting with `'?'`.
- The next value is `k`, which is either the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 1 if no such `i` exists. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, and since no previous values of `i` have been considered, `k` will be 1.
- The next value is `best`, which is 0.
- The next value is `k` again, which is 1.
- The next value is `i`, which is 1.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the following:
Output: **? 1 0 1 1**
