To determine what will be printed by the `print(sm)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `i` is set to `n`.
- `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index.
- `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements, where each element is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index.
- `sm` is a variable that is updated based on the following conditions:
  - If `sm` < 0, then `sm` is updated to `sm * 2 + suf[n] + (abs(sm) // 10 + 1) * 10`.
  - Otherwise, `sm` is updated to `sm % 10`.

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `suf` and `smin`:**
   - `suf` is a list of cumulative sums of elements in `l`.
   - `smin` is a list of minimum values encountered in `suf` up to each index.

2. **Updating `sm`:**
   - The value of `sm` depends on whether it is negative or non-negative.
   - If `sm` is negative, it undergoes a more complex transformation involving the last element of `suf` and the absolute value of `sm`.
   - If `sm` is non-negative, it is simply updated to `sm % 10`.

### Determining the Final Value of `sm`:
- Since the exact values of `l`, `suf`, and `smin` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `sm`.
- However, we can describe the process and the potential outcomes based on the given conditions.

### Possible Outcomes:
- If `sm` is initially negative, the update formula `sm * 2 + suf[n] + (abs(sm) // 10 + 1) * 10` will produce a new value for `sm`.
- If `sm` is initially non-negative, the update formula `sm % 10` will produce a new value for `sm`.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity and the lack of specific values for `l`, `suf`, and `smin`, the best we can do is describe the process and the potential outcomes.

Output: **sm (where sm is the result of the update formula based on the initial value of sm and the elements in the suf list)**
