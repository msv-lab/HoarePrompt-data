The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which is now 2).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order followed by a 0, `dp` is `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or not True`, `i` is 2**
