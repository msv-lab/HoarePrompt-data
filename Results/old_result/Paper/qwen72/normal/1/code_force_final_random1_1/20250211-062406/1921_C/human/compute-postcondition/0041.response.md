The provided code snippet appends a calculated value to the list `array2`. This calculation is based on the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i-1` of the list `arr`, multiplied by the value of `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `test_cases` must be greater than `n`
- `i` is 3
- `feat` is a list of integers read from input
- `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 3
- `f` is the second element of `feat`
- `a` is the third element of `feat`
- `b` is the last element of `feat`
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the new input
- `array2` is determined based on the condition involving the difference between the second and first elements of `arr` and the division of `b` by `a`

The code snippet:
```python
array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
```

Impact of the code:
- The value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` is appended to `array2`.
- Since `i` is 3, the value being appended is `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `array2` now contains the additional value `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than `n`, `i` is 3, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 3, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the new input, `array2` is a list containing the result of `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a` along with its previous elements.**
