### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading an integer `t` that specifies the number of test cases. It then iterates over this number to process each test case individually.

2. **Variable Assignment**: For each test case, the program reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` which represent the number of yogurts, the price per yogurt, and the promotional price for two yogurts, respectively.

3. **Promotion Check**: The program checks if the promotional price for two yogurts (`C`) is less than twice the regular price (`B * 2`). This is a crucial step to determine whether it's cheaper to buy yogurts at the promotional price or the regular price.

4. **Even Number of Yogurts**: If the number of yogurts `A` is even, the program calculates the total cost by dividing `A` by 2 and multiplying by the promotional price `C`. This ensures that all yogurts are bought at the promotional price, which is the most cost-effective option when `C` is less than `2 * B`.

5. **Odd Number of Yogurts**: If the number of yogurts `A` is odd, the program buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price and then buys one additional yogurt at the regular price. This is done by calculating `X = A // 2` (the number of pairs) and then adding the cost of one additional yogurt `B` to the total cost.

6. **Output**: The program prints the calculated minimum cost for each test case, which is the expected output format.

### Correctness:
Based on the reasoning above, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts given the regular and promotional prices. The program handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

**Correctness: True**
