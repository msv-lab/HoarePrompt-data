Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. Additionally, either `obj` is `.B` and the next position `nxt` contains a player, or `obj` is a player and the next position `nxt` is the same as the position of `.B`.**
