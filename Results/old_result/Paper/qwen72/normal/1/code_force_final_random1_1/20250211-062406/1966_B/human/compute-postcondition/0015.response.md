To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head:

```python
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `j`.
   - The loop will execute if `range(m - 1)` generates a sequence of numbers, which means `m - 1` must be greater than 0.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `m - 1` must be greater than 0.
   - This implies that `m` must be greater than 1.

3. **Initial State Adjustments:**
   - We need to ensure that `m` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial state provides `m` as an input integer, but it does not specify that `m` is greater than 1. Therefore, we need to adjust this condition.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - The other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `gr`, `i`, `ans`, `impossible`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted State:
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `j` is initialized to 0 (as it is the starting point of the range).

### Final State:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, `impossible` is True, `j` is 0**
