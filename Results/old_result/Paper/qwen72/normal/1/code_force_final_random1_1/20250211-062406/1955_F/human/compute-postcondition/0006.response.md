The only object in the loop head is the loop counter `_`, which is implicitly managed by the `range` function. The loop counter is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, and the loop continues as long as the loop counter is less than the value of `int(input())`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `p` is a list of even integers derived from the current input.
- The loop counter is incremented by 1 and must still be less than the value of `int(input())`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the loop counter must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than the value of `int(input())`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `p` is a list of even integers derived from the current input, the loop counter is incremented by 1 and must still be less than the value of `int(input())`**
