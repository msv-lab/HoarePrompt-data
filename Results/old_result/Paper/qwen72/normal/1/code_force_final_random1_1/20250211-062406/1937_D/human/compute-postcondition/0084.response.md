Postcondition: ***`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 0, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`, `n` is greater than 0, and the current character at position `i` in the string `s` is '>'. If `r` is 0, both `B` and `idx_B` remain empty lists. If `r` is not 0, `a` is set to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` if `l - r > 0` or `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` otherwise, and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.***
