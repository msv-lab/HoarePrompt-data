Output State: **After the loop has executed all its iterations, `tc` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, the value of `dp` will be `False` if there exists any pair of consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is `0`) such that their difference is less than or equal to 1. Otherwise, `dp` will be `True`. The variable `n` will be the length of `arr` minus 1, and `arr` will be a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0`. The value of `i` will be `len(arr) - 1` for each iteration, but it will not persist outside the loop.**

This means that after processing all test cases, the loop will have printed "Alice" or "Bob" for each test case based on the conditions described, and the loop will terminate with `tc` set to 0. The internal state of `arr`, `n`, and `dp` will reflect the final state of the last test case processed.
