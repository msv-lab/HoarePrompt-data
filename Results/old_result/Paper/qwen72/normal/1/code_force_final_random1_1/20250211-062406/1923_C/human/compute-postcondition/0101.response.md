Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `m` is greater than 1 (this variable is also not directly used in the print statement).
- `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input.
- `i` is defined as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is defined as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

### Conditions:
- If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met.
- Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 ≤ 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition 1**: `b - a + 1 > 1`
   - This means that the range between `a` and `b` must include more than one element.
   - If this condition is not met, then `b - a + 1 ≤ 1`, and the print statement will execute.

2. **Condition 2**: `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`
   - This means that the difference between `s` and the length of the range `(b - a + 1)` must be greater than or equal to `i`.
   - If this condition is not met, then `s - (b - a + 1) < i`, and the print statement will execute.

### Conclusion:
- If either of the conditions is not met, the print statement `print('NO')` will execute.
- Since the problem does not specify the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `p`, we cannot definitively determine if the conditions are met. However, the print statement will always execute if the conditions are not met.

### Final Output:
The print statement will always print 'NO' if the conditions are not met. Given the problem's setup, it is clear that the conditions are not met, leading to the execution of the print statement.

Output: **NO**
