Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `c` will be equal to `cases`, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, `na_frente` and `pos_final` will be adjusted to their respective indices (decremented by 1), and the variable `total` will hold the cumulative sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0. The variable `best` will hold the minimum value between the initial `best` (10^12) and the sum of `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` where `v <= pos_final`. The variable `v` will be -1, indicating the loop has completed its iterations. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.**
