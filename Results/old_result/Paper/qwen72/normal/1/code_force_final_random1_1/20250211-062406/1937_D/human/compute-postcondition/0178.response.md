Postcondition: ***`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, and `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If `l` is less than `r`, `a` is equal to `A[l]`, and `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * 1`. If `l` is equal to or greater than `r`, and `r` is 0, the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions described in the else part. Specifically, if `s[i]` is '>', `l` is incremented by 1, `r` remains unchanged, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `s[i]` is not '>', `l` is 0, and `r` is the length of `B` minus 1. If `r` is 0 and `l` is 0, `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions described in the if part. If `r` is 0 and `l` is 1, `a` is set to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `r` is 0 and `l` is greater than `r`, the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions described in the else part. If `r` is not 0, `a` is equal to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.***
