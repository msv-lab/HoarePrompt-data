Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `x` is the new input string, `xx` is a list that includes the new input string `x` at least once, `j` is 2, `xx` has one additional element which is the new input string `x`, `a[3]` is increased by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'F', `xx` includes `x` twice and `a[1]` is increased by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', the value at index 1 of `b` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value at index 1 of `b` remains unchanged.**
