Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 2 elements.
- `test` is True.
- The difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j - 1]` in the list `lis` is greater than 1.
- The index `j` is odd.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('Bob')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
