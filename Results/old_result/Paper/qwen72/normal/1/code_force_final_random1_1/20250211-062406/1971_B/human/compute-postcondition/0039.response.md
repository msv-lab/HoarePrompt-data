The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `s`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. The function's output is not specified in the given information, so I cannot determine the exact return value. However, based on the parameters, the function likely processes the integer `t` and the string `s` in some way.
