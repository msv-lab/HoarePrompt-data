Postcondition: **After all iterations, `_` is 0 (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), `b` is the last input string provided during the final iteration. The list `k` contains the counts of '1' characters from each input string `b` where '1' was present, in the order the inputs were received. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and the grid remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. Additionally, the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`.**
