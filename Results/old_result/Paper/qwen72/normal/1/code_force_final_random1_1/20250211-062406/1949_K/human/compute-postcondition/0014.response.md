The function `func_2` accepts five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of elements in the list `numbers`.
- `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, representing the sizes of three groups into which the elements of `numbers` will be divided.
- `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers, where each element satisfies `1 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 10^9`.

The function returns one of two cases:

- **Case_1**: If it is possible to distribute the elements of `numbers` into three lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` of sizes `na`, `nb`, and `nc` respectively, such that the sums of the elements in these lists (`sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c`) satisfy the condition that `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` returns `True`, then the function returns `'YES'` along with the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`.
- **Case_2**: If it is not possible to satisfy the above condition, the function returns `'NO'`.

Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. It returns 'YES' and the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` if the elements of `numbers` can be distributed into these groups such that the sums of the elements in each group satisfy a specific condition (as determined by `func_1`). If this is not possible, it returns 'NO'.**
