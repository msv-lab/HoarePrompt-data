Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string according to the specified algorithm. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the `func_1` function handles the replacement of characters. The function attempts to replace each character in the string `s` with a corresponding character from the `unique_chars` list, but it does not correctly maintain the mapping between the original characters and their symmetric counterparts.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
10
serofedsoc
```

**Expected Output:**
```
codeforces
```

**Actual Output:**
The actual output will not match the expected output because the function incorrectly manipulates the `unique_chars` list and does not correctly map the characters in the string `s` to their symmetric counterparts.

To illustrate, let's walk through the function step-by-step with the input "serofedsoc":

1. `unique_chars` is initialized as `['c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's']`.
2. The function iterates over each character in the string "serofedsoc":
   - For 's': It replaces 's' with 'c' and updates `j` to 5.
   - For 'e': It replaces 'e' with 'r' and updates `j` to 4.
   - For 'r': It replaces 'r' with 'o' and updates `j` to 3.
   - For 'o': It replaces 'o' with 'f' and updates `j` to 2.
   - For 'f': It replaces 'f' with 'e' and updates `j` to 1.
   - For 'e': It replaces 'e' with 'd' and updates `j` to 0.
   - For 'd': It replaces 'd' with 'c' and updates `j` to -1.
   - For 's': It replaces 's' with 'c' and updates `j` to -2.
   - For 'o': It replaces 'o' with 'c' and updates `j` to -3.
   - For 'c': It replaces 'c' with 'c' and updates `j` to -4.

As you can see, the function does not correctly handle the symmetric replacement, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
