To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `t` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 3 elements
- `j` is 2
- `test` is either True or False depending on the condition inside the loop

### Loop Head:
```python
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of `lis` starting from 1 up to `len(lis) - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `len(lis)`.

### Adjustments:
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to 3.
- The length of `lis` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute one more time (since `j` will be 3, and the loop condition is `j < len(lis)`).

### Updated State:
State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 4 elements, `j` is 3, `test` remains either True or False as it was initially.**
