Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 1 if no such `i` exists.
   - `res` is an input string.
   - If `res` is '<', `best` is set to 1. Otherwise, `best` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `k` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` was ever '<' for any previous value of `i`, `k` will be that value of `i`. If `res` was never '<', `k` will be 1.
   - `best` is 1 if `res` is '<', otherwise it is 0.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `res` is '<':
     - `best` will be 1.
     - `k` will be the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<'. Since `i` is currently 2, if this is the first time `res` is checked, `k` will be 2.
   - If `res` is not '<':
     - `best` will be 0.
     - `k` will be 1 because no `i` has made `res` '<'.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `res` is '<':
     - The print statement will output: `? 2 1 2 2`
   - If `res` is not '<':
     - The print statement will output: `? 1 0 1 2`

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be one of the two scenarios described above. Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both possibilities.

Output: **? [k] [best] [k] 2 (where [k] is 2 if res is '<', otherwise 1, and [best] is 1 if res is '<', otherwise 0)**
