Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `p` is `[0]`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least one element, `c` is `[0]`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `x` is the first element of `l`, and the value of `x` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
