The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts parameters related to the test cases, including `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`. 

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5 (number of test cases).
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26.
  - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26.
  - `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000.
  - `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- The sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.

The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, but typically, such a function would process the input and produce some result based on the given parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by parameters `n`, `k`, `m`, and a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the given parameters.**
