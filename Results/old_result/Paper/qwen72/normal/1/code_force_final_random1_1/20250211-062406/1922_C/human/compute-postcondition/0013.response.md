Output State: **`t` is an integer where 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is equal to `t` and greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d1[3]` is 2, `d1[4]` is 2, `d2` remains a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int`.**

Explanation:
- The code `d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]` updates the value of `d1[4]` (since `i` is 2) to be `1 + d1[3]`.
- From the initial state, `d1[3]` is either 2 or `l[2] - l[1] + d1[2]`. However, since `d1[2]` is 1, `d1[3]` is 2 regardless of the condition.
- Therefore, `d1[4]` is set to `1 + 2`, which is 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
