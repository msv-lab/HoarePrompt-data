Postcondition: **After all iterations of the loop, `lst` contains indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. The variable `elem` is the last element processed in `lst`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `mini`, `ele`) remain unchanged. Additionally, the length of `final` is 1. If `c1` (which is equal to `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` contains the element 0. Otherwise, `final` contains the value `n`.**
