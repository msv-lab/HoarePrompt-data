Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value (1) and `i` (1), `i` is 1, `int(sqrt(x))` must be at least 1, and the current value of `i` divides `x` without a remainder. Additionally, the current value of `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i` without a remainder.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value (which was 1) and the current value of `i` (which is also 1). Since both values are 1, `ans` remains 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `i`) and conditions remain unchanged.
