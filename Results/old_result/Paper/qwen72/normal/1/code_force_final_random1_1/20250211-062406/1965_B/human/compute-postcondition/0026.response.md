The code snippet `ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))` appends a new element to the list `ans`. This new element is calculated as `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, where `sum(ans)` is the sum of all elements currently in the list `ans`.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Current State of `ans`:**
   - `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`.
   - The length of `ans` is `lk - 1` because it contains elements from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`.

2. **Sum of `ans`:**
   - The sum of the elements in `ans` is the sum of the first `lk - 1` powers of 2, which is `2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^(lk-2)`.
   - The sum of the first `n` powers of 2 is `2^n - 1`. Therefore, the sum of the first `lk - 1` powers of 2 is `2^(lk-1) - 1`.

3. **New Element Calculation:**
   - The new element to be appended is `k - 1 - (2^(lk-1) - 1)`.
   - Simplifying this, we get `k - 1 - 2^(lk-1) + 1`, which simplifies further to `k - 2^(lk-1)`.

4. **Updated `ans`:**
   - After appending the new element, `ans` will now contain the elements `[2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^(lk-2), k - 2^(lk-1)]`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `i`, `lk`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`, `2 ≤ k ≤ n`, `b` is the binary string of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary string of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)` followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `lk` is the length of `bk`, `i` is `lk - 2`, `lk` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
