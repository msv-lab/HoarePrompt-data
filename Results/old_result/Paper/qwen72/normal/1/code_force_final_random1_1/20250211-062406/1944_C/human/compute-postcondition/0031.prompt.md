You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 0 ≤ arr[i] < len(arr), and the length of arr (n) satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    start = 0
    vis = set()
    while nums.get(start, 0):
        vis.add(start)
        
        nums[start] -= 1
        
        if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
            nums[start + 1] -= 1
            start += 1
        else:
            print(start + 1)
            return
        
    #State: The loop will continue to execute until it can no longer find a valid `start + 1` in `nums` with a non-zero frequency. At the end of the loop, `start` will be the last index that was successfully processed, and `vis` will be a set containing all the indices from 0 up to `start`. The frequencies in `nums` will be updated such that for each index `i` in `vis`, the frequency of `i` in `nums` will be reduced by the number of times it was decremented during the loop. If the loop exits due to `nums.get(start, 0)` being 0, the final value of `start` will be the last index processed, and the program will print `start + 1` and terminate.
    print(start)
    #This is printed: start (where start is the last index that was successfully processed before the loop exited)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and modifies a `Counter` object `nums` by decreasing the frequency of 0 by 1, the frequency of 1 by 2, and the frequency of 2 by 2 (ensuring the frequency of 2 remains greater than 0). It also sets `start` to 2 and `vis` to a set containing 0, 1, and 2. The function does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing.

Case_2: The program does not return any value.

Case_3: The program returns nothing. However, the state of the program after execution includes: `nums` is a Counter object where the frequency of the integer 0 is decreased by 1, the frequency of the integer 1 is decreased by 2, and the frequency of the integer 2 is decreased by 2 (but still greater than 0); `start` is 2; and `vis` is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 2.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
