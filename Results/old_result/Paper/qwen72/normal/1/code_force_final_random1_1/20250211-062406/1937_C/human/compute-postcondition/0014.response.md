The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4, and `n` must still be greater than 4.

State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `k` is 1, and `res` is the new input string provided. If `res` is '<', then `k` is updated to 3. The input provided to `int(input())` must be greater than 0.**
