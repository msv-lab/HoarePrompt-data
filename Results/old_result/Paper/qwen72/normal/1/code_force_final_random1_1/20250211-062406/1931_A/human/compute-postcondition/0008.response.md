Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 27 and 52 (inclusive), `word` is 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The value of `n` remains an integer between 27 and 52 (inclusive).
- The value of `word` is updated to `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. This means `word` now contains the string 'a', followed by the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 28`, followed by 'z'. For example, if `n` is 27, `word` becomes 'aayz'; if `n` is 52, `word` becomes 'azyz'.
