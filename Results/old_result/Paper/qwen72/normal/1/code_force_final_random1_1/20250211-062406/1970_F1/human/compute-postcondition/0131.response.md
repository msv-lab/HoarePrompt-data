Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `time` is 0.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`.
   - `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
   - Either `obj` is not equal to `.B` or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is not a player.
   - Either `obj` is not a player or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`.
   - `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`.
   - The current value of `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, indicating that `pos` is within a goal area.
   - `team` is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Explanation of Variables:**
   - `time` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `team` is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`, and since `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, it means `pos` is within a goal area, and `team` is a valid team identifier.
   - `GoalName` is a dictionary or list that maps team identifiers to their corresponding names.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will format the string with `time` and `GoalName[team]`.
   - Since `time` is 0, the first part of the string will be `0`.
   - `GoalName[team]` will be the name of the team associated with the goal area where `pos` is located.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **0 [GoalName[team]] GOAL (where [GoalName[team]] is the name of the team associated with the goal area where `pos` is located)**
