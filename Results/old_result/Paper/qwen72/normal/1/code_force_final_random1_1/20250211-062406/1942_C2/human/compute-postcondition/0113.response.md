Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is adjusted based on the condition: if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)`. `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `tmp` is a list containing one element: `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` if the condition is met, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty list, and `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2 + (a[3] - a[2]) // 2` if the condition is met, otherwise `ans` remains `x + y - 2`.***
