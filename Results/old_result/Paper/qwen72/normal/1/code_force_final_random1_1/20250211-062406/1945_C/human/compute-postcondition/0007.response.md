Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` is odd, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2` (a float)**

Explanation:
- The value of `pk` is calculated as `n / 2`. Since `n` is an input integer and is specified to be odd, `pk` will be a float because dividing an odd integer by 2 results in a non-integer value.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from the initial state.
