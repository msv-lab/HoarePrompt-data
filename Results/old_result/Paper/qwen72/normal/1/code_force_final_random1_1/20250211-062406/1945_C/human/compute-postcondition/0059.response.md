The code `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`.

- `elem` is the third element in `lst`.
- `final` initially contains the first element in `lst` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in `lst` is equal to `mini`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, `final` also contains the second element in `lst`.

After appending `elem`, the new state of `final` includes the third element from `lst`.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `mini`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the count of '1' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` must have at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `lst`, `final` is a list containing the first element in `lst` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in `lst` is equal to `mini`, and if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, `final` also contains the second element in `lst`, and now `final` also contains the third element in `lst`.**
