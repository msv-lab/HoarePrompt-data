### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_10()` to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_15()` to compute the result and prints it.

2. **Function `func_15`**:
   - This function reads two integers `n` and `m` using `func_7()`.
   - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It enters a loop where it increments `i` and adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans` until \(i^2 > n + i\).
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Problem Requirements**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Analysis of `func_15`**:
   - The function `func_15` does not directly address the problem requirements. It calculates a sum based on a different formula and returns a value that does not correspond to the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as required by the problem.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_15` is not correctly solving the problem as described. It does not count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because the function `func_15` does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as specified. It calculates a different value that does not match the problem's requirements.
