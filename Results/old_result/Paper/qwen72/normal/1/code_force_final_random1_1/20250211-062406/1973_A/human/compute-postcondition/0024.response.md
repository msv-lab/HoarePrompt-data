Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `total_points` is equal to the sum of the elements of the next tuple (p1 + p2 + p3), `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is equal to the sum of the next tuple's elements minus 2 * (next p3 - next p2) - 2 * (next p3 - next p1). If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends `-1` to the list `resultats`.
- The values of `t`, `cas_de_test`, `total_points`, `total_matchs`, and `egalites` remain unchanged.
- The condition for appending `-1` to `resultats` is that `total_points` is odd, which is part of the initial state and remains true after the code execution.
- No other variables are affected by the code.
