Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`, and `mex` is now equal to `n - sum(ar)`. The variable `i` is `-1` after the loop has completed all its iterations.**

Explanation:
- The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `ar`.
- The initial state mentions that `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, which is consistent with the effect of the code.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `res`, and `mex` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
- The variable `i` remains `-1` as it is not modified by the given code snippet.
