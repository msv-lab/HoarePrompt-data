Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the next `n` elements are the input strings corresponding to each iteration, `a` and `b` are updated based on the transitions in the input strings, `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. Additionally, the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. If `a[1]` and `b[1]` are both 0, then `sa` now includes the index `1`.***
