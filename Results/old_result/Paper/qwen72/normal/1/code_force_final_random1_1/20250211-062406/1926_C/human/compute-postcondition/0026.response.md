To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the current state:

### Given Loop:
```python
for j in str(i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Current State:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case
- `N` is 200001
- `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0
- `pd[N]` is now the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N` plus `pd[N-1]`
- `i` is `N`
- `pd[i]` is now `pd[i]` plus the integer value of `j`

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each character `j` in the string representation of `i`.
- The loop will continue as long as there are characters left in `str(i)`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which is derived from `str(i)`.
2. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `str(i)` must be processed.
3. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` will be the next character in `str(i)`.
   - The value of `i` remains the same because the loop is iterating over the characters of `i`, not changing `i` itself.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `N` remains the same.
- `pd` remains the same.
- `i` remains the same.
- `pd[i]` will be updated based on the next character `j`.

Since the loop is iterating over the characters of `i`, the next state will be:

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0, `pd[N]` is now the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N` plus `pd[N-1]`, `i` is `N`, `pd[i]` is now `pd[i]` plus the integer value of the next character `j` in `str(i)`**.
