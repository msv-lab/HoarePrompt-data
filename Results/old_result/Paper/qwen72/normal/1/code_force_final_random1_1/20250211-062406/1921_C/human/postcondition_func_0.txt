The function `func` reads multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of messages `n`, the initial phone's charge `f`, the charge consumption per unit of time `a`, the charge consumption when turning the phone off and on `b`, and a list of moments `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n` when messages need to be sent. For each test case, it calculates whether the phone can send all messages without running out of charge. If the total charge required to send all messages (considering both continuous usage and turning the phone off and on) is less than the initial charge `f`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each one. The variable `t` (number of test cases) remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
