Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `ntest` is equal to `t`.
- `itest` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `ntest` must be greater than 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `a`**:
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers. This means the elements in `a` are arranged in non-decreasing order.
   - The smallest element in `a` is `a[0]`.
   - The largest element in `a` is `a[len(a) - 1]`.

2. **Expression in the Print Statement**:
   - The expression `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]` calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the list `a`.

3. **Output**:
   - The print statement will output the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the list `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[len(a) - 1] - a[0] (where a[len(a) - 1] is the largest element in the sorted list `a` and a[0] is the smallest element in the sorted list `a`)**

This means the output will be the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted list `a`.
