The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 2 because the loop starts from 1 and increments by 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2. The variable `i` will start at 1 as specified by the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `i` is 1**
