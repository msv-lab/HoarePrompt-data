Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters). It returns a list of `n` integers, where each integer is the cumulative product of the elements in a reordered list `b` from the last to the current index, taken modulo `m`. The list `b` is constructed by rearranging the elements of `a` based on the characters in `s`: if `s[i]` is 'L', the element from the start of `a` is added to `b`; if `s[i]` is 'R', the element from the end of `a` is added to `b`. The final list is reversed before being returned. **
