Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 â‰¤ 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`. `l` is a list of integers from user input.**
