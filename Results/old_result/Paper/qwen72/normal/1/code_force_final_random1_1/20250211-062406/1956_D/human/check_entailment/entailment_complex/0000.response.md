### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
   - Each operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, l, r, ops)`**:
     - This function handles the base cases and recursive steps for modifying the array and recording operations.
     - If `l == r` and `a[l] != 0`, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and records the operation.
     - If `l != r` and `a[l] != r - l + 1`, it sets the subarray `a[l:r+1]` to `r - l + 1` and records the operation.
     - It recursively calls itself to ensure all subarrays are processed correctly.

   - **`func_2(a)`**:
     - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array.
     - It returns the sum of the modified array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

   - **`recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`**:
     - This function decides whether to apply the MEX operation based on the sum of the subarray.
     - If the sum is less than or equal to the square of the subarray length, it applies the MEX operation and records it.
     - Otherwise, it recursively processes the subarrays around the maximum element.

   - **`func_3()`**:
     - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the results, and prints the required output.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Base Cases**: The base cases in `func_1` are correctly handled, ensuring that single-element subarrays are processed appropriately.
   - **Recursive Calls**: The recursive calls in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` ensure that all subarrays are processed, and the operations are recorded correctly.
   - **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the modified array is calculated correctly in `func_2`.
   - **Operation Count**: The number of operations is correctly counted and recorded in `ops`.
   - **Output Format**: The output format matches the problem requirements, printing the sum, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array using the specified operations and meets the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: **True**
