Output State: **`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and the value at `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `rest` remains `k - delta`, `pos` remains the same, `a` remains the same except the element at index `sorted_indices[pos]` is reduced by `delta`, `distance` is `distance + 1`, and the values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `delta` is calculated as the minimum of `rest` and the value at `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`.
- `rest` remains `k - delta` as specified in the initial state.
- `pos` remains the same unless `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, in which case `pos` would be incremented by 1. However, since the code snippet only calculates `delta`, `pos` does not change.
- The element at index `sorted_indices[pos]` in `a` is reduced by `delta`.
- `distance` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged except for the modification to `a` as described.
