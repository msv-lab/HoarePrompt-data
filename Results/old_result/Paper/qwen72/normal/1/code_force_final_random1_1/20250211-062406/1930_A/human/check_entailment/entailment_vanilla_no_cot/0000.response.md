Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted. This ensures that when we take pairs of elements, the smaller element of each pair (which is what we need to maximize the score) is always the first element of the pair in the sorted list.

2. **Pair Selection**: The loop iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, effectively selecting the smaller element of each pair (since the list is sorted, `l[i]` is always the smaller element of the pair `(l[i], l[i+1])`).

3. **Score Calculation**: The score is incremented by the smaller element of each pair, which is `l[i]`.

4. **Output**: The final score is printed for each test case.

This approach guarantees that the maximum possible score is achieved because the smallest elements are always chosen first, ensuring the sum of the minimum values is maximized. The solution handles all constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.
