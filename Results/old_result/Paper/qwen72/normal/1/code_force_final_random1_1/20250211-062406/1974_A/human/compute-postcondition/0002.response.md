The values of `x` and `y` are updated based on the input provided by the user. The input is split into two parts, which are then converted to integers and assigned to `x` and `y` respectively. The values of `t`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user (0 <= x, y <= 99), `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
