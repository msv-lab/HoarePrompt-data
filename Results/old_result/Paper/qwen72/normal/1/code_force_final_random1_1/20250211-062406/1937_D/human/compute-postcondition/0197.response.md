Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 2, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`**.

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.
- All other variables (`j`, `i`, `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, `r`, `a`) remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `b` after the update depends on the initial value of `b`, the value of `i`, the value of `idx_A[l - 1]`, and the value of `r`.
