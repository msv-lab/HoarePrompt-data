Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `x` remains at least 1, `n` is updated to the value provided by the input, `q` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`, and `t` remains unchanged. If `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the previous `ans` and 3, and the loop will execute again if `3 < int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. Otherwise, the loop will not update `ans` and will continue to check the condition for the next iteration.***
