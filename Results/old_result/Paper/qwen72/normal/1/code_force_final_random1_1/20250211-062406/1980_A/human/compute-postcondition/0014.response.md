The code appends the value of `missing` to the list `results`. This operation does not alter the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `freq`, or `missing` themselves, but it changes the state of `results` by adding one more element to it.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is managed by the `range` function, `n`, `m`, and `a` are the values from the tuple `test_cases[_]`, `a` must be a non-empty iterable, `freq` is a list where each element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` for each `prob` in `a` is incremented by 1, and all other elements remain 0, `missing` is the sum of the differences `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, `results` now includes the value of `missing` as its last element.**
