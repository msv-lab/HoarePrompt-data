Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This is done using a loop that iterates `t` times.

2. **Reading and Sorting Input**: For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers. It then sorts this list. Sorting is crucial because the optimal strategy involves always choosing the smallest available number to maximize the score.

3. **Score Calculation**: The program calculates the score by iterating over the sorted list and adding every second element (starting from the first element) to the score. This is because, in a sorted list, the minimum value of any pair `(x, y)` will always be the smaller of the two, which corresponds to the elements at even indices when considering 0-based indexing.

4. **Output**: After calculating the score for each test case, it prints the result.

This approach ensures that the program always selects the smallest possible values to maximize the score, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

Given the above points, the program is logically correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
