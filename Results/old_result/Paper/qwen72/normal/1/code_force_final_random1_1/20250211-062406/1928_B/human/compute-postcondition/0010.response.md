The code appends the value of `tem` to the list `ans`. The value of `tem` is the product of the last three elements of `arr`. The initial state specifies that `ans` already contains the last element of `arr` and the product of the last two elements of `arr`. After appending `tem`, the list `ans` will contain these three elements.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, the product of the last two elements of `arr`, and the product of the last three elements of `arr`, `tem` is `arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2] * arr[len(arr) - 3]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 3`.**
