### Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The function correctly processes the input `t` and `cas_de_test`, ensuring that `t` is a positive integer within the range [1, 500] and `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \) such that \( 0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 \).

2. **Total Points Check**:
   - The function checks if the total points \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \) is odd. If it is, the result is immediately set to -1 because the total points must be even for the scores to be consistent with the rules of the game (each game contributes either 2 points for a win/loss or 2 points for a draw).

3. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the total number of matches \( \text{total\_matchs} \) as \( \text{total\_points} // 2 \). This is correct because each match (whether a win/loss or a draw) contributes 2 points to the total.

4. **Feasibility Check**:
   - The function checks if \( \text{total\_matchs} \) is greater than 3 or if \( p_3 \) is greater than \( \text{total\_matchs} \). This is necessary because:
     - The maximum number of matches that can be played is 3 (since there are only 3 players).
     - The highest score \( p_3 \) cannot exceed the total number of matches.

5. **Draws Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the number of draws \( \text{egalites} \) using the formula \( \text{total\_points} - 2 \times (p_3 - p_2) - 2 \times (p_3 - p_1) \). This formula is derived from the fact that the difference in points between the highest scorer and the others must be accounted for by wins and losses, and the remaining points are due to draws.
   - If \( \text{egalites} \) is negative, the result is set to -1, indicating an inconsistency.
   - Otherwise, the number of draws is \( \text{egalites} // 2 \).

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or to detect inconsistencies in the scores. The conditions and calculations are logically sound and align with the problem requirements.
