Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 4. If `aOnes` < `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1.***
