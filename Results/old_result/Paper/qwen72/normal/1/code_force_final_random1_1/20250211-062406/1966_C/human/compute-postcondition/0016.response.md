The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is `tc - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`dp` will be `False` if there exists any pair of consecutive elements in `arr` such that the difference between them is 1 or less. Otherwise, `dp` will be `True`. The value of `i` will be `len(arr) - 1`, and the variables `tc`, `n`, and `arr` will remain unchanged, except `tc` must be greater than 0.**
