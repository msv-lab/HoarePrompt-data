You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; c is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [0]
        
        c = [0]
        
        i, j = 0, 0
        
        for x in l:
            if x == 1:
                j += 1
            i += x
            p.append(i)
            c.append(j)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
            s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is decremented by the number of test cases executed, `m` is 0 for the current test case, `a` and `b` are the last values provided by the user input for the current test case, `i` is equal to `c[b] - c[a - 1]` with the final values of `a` and `b`, and `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]` with the final values of `a` and `b`. The conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO' are evaluated based on these final values of `a` and `b`. All other variables (`n`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `j`) remain unchanged for the current test case, but will be reinitialized for the next test case if any.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of elements `n`, the number of queries `q`, a list of integers `c`, and a list of queries `queries`. For each query `(l_i, r_i)`, the function returns a result based on the sublist `c[l_i-1:r_i]`. The function returns a list of results for all queries across all test cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
