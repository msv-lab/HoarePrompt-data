Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is \((n + 1) // 2\)**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is updated to \((n + 1) // 2\).
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `tot`, `pow`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
