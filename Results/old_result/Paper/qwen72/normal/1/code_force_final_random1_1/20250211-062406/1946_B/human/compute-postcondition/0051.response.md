To determine what will be printed by the `print(sm)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `b` is a list of strings obtained from user input split by whitespace.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b`.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from a new user input split by whitespace.
   - `suf` is a list containing the elements `[0, 0 + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]]`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `smin` is a list where each element at index `i` (from 0 to `n`) is the minimum value of the suffix sums from `suf[1]` to `suf[i+1]`.
   - `sm` is initially `2 + suf[n]`.

2. **Update Logic for `sm`:**
   - If `sm` (which is initially `2 + suf[n]`) is less than 0, then `sm` is updated to `2 + suf[n] + (abs(2 + suf[n]) // 10 + 1) * 10`.
   - Otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % 10`.

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - **Calculate `suf`:**
     - `suf` is a cumulative sum list starting with 0 and adding each element of `l` to the previous sum.
     - For example, if `l = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, then `suf` would be `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10]`.

   - **Calculate `smin`:**
     - `smin` is a list where each element at index `i` is the minimum value of the suffix sums from `suf[1]` to `suf[i+1]`.
     - For example, if `suf = [0, 1, 3, 6, 10]`, then `smin` would be `[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.

   - **Calculate `sm`:**
     - `sm` is initially `2 + suf[n]`.
     - For example, if `n = 4` and `suf = [0, 1, 3, 6, 10]`, then `suf[n] = 10` and `sm = 2 + 10 = 12`.

   - **Update `sm` based on the condition:**
     - If `sm < 0`, then `sm` is updated to `2 + suf[n] + (abs(2 + suf[n]) // 10 + 1) * 10`.
     - If `sm >= 0`, then `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % 10`.

4. **Final Value of `sm`:**
   - Since `sm` is initially `12` (which is greater than 0), it will be updated to `12 % 10 = 2`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(sm)` statement will be:
Output: **2**
