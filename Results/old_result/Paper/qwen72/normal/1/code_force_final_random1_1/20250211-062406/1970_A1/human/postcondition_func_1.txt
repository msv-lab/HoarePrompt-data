The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a non-empty string of balanced parentheses with a maximum length of 500,000. It processes the string to create a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, each containing the cumulative balance of parentheses, the index, and the character at that index. After sorting this list based on the balance and then the negative index, it constructs a new string from the sorted list and prints it. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints a rearranged version of the original string `s` that is also a valid balanced parentheses sequence.
