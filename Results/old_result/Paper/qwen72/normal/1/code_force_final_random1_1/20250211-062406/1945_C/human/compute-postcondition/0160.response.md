Output State: **`lst` is an empty list, `ele` is undefined, `mini` is 100000000, `final` is an empty list or contains either 0 or `n` based on `c1`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `i` is 0, if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0' then `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0 and `zero_perc` is 100, otherwise `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1 and `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`**.

Explanation:
- The variable `one_perc` is calculated using the formula `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.
- `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`.
- `one` is 0 if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', otherwise it is 1.
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `i` is 0.
- The formula calculates the percentage of remaining '1' characters in the string `s` after the first character has been considered.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
