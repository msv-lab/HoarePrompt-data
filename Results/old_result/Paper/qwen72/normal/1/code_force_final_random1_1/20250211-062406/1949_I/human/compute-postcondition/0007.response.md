The code snippet reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the first elements of the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` respectively. The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` initially contain `None` values of length `n`. After executing the code, the first element of each of these lists will be updated with the corresponding integer values from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list where the first element is an input integer and the rest are `None`, `y` is a list where the first element is an input integer and the rest are `None`, `r` is a list where the first element is an input integer and the rest are `None`, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `i` is 0.**
