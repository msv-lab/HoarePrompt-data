Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `j` will be equal to `n`.
- `i` will be 0.
- `idx_B` will contain the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order.
- `B` will contain the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop.
- If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty lists.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is the length of `B` minus 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- The character at index `i` of the string `s` is not '>'.
- Additionally, `r` is 0, which means `B` contains exactly one element.
- `l` is greater than `r`.

### Analysis:
- Since `r` is 0, `B` contains exactly one element.
- `l` is greater than `r`, so `l` must be 1.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order. Since `B` contains exactly one element, `idx_B` must also contain exactly one element.
- `idx_A` is not mentioned in the initial state, but it is used in the print statement. We need to assume that `idx_A` is similar to `idx_B` but for some other character or condition. Since `l` is 1, `idx_A` must have at least one element, and `l - 1` refers to the first element of `idx_A`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **`n - i`**:
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - Therefore, `n - i` is simply `n`.

2. **`(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `l` is 1, so `l - 1` is 0.
   - `idx_A[l - 1]` is the first element of `idx_A`.
   - Let's denote the first element of `idx_A` as `idx_A[0]`.
   - Therefore, `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` is `(0 - idx_A[0]) * 2`, which simplifies to `-2 * idx_A[0]`.

3. **Combining the Results**:
   - The expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` becomes `n + (-2 * idx_A[0])`.
   - This simplifies to `n - 2 * idx_A[0]`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the value of `n - 2 * idx_A[0]`.

Output: **n - 2 * idx_A[0]** (where `n` is the value of `n` and `idx_A[0]` is the first element of `idx_A`)
