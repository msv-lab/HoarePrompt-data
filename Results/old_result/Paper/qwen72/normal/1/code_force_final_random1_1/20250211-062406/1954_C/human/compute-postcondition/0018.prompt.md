Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `b` is a list of integers derived from the input string, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`, `i` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
    new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `b` is a list of integers derived from the input string, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `new` is a list where the first element is `max(a[0], b[0])` and the rest are `None`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`, except the first element which is `min(a[0], b[0])`, `i` is 1, and `a[0]` is equal to `b[0]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `b` is a list of integers derived from the input string, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `new` is a list where the first element is `max(a[0], b[0])`, the second element is `max(a[1], b[1])`, and the rest are `None`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`, except the first element which is `min(a[0], b[0])` and the second element which is `min(a[1], b[1])`, `i` is 2, and `a[1]` must be equal to `b[1]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `b` is a list of integers derived from the input string, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `new` is a list where the first element is `max(a[0], b[0])`, the second element is `max(a[1], b[1])`, the third element is `a[2]` (or `b[2]` since they are equal), and the rest are `None`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`, except the first element which is `min(a[0], b[0])`, the second element which is `min(a[1], b[1])`, and the third element which is `min(a[2], b[2])`, `i` is 3, `len(a)` must be greater than 2, and `a[2]` must be equal to `b[2]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
