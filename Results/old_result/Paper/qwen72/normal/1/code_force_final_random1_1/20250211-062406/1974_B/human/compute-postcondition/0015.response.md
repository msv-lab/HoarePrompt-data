Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's analyze the impact:

- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 2.
- `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the string `s`.
- `char` is the second character in `s`.
- If `char` is in `unique_chars`, `s` is updated by replacing all occurrences of `char` with `unique_chars[j-1]`, `i` is 0, and `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 2`.
- If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `char` is inserted at index 0 of `unique_chars`, `i` is 1, and `j` is `len(unique_chars)`.

The code snippet:
```python
unique_chars.insert(i, char)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `char`:**
   - `char` is the second character in `s`.

2. **Check if `char` is in `unique_chars`:**
   - If `char` is in `unique_chars`, `i` is 0, and `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 2`.
   - If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `i` is 1, and `j` is `len(unique_chars)`.

3. **Insert `char` into `unique_chars` at index `i`:**
   - If `i` is 0, `char` is inserted at the beginning of `unique_chars`.
   - If `i` is 1, `char` is inserted at index 1 of `unique_chars`.

### Output State Calculation:
- If `char` is in `unique_chars`, `i` is 0, and `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 2`. The insertion at index 0 will duplicate `char` in `unique_chars`, which contradicts the requirement that `unique_chars` should contain unique characters. Therefore, this scenario is invalid under the given conditions.
- If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `i` is 1, and `j` is `len(unique_chars)`. The insertion at index 1 will add `char` to `unique_chars`.

### Final Output State:
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `unique_chars` now includes `char` at index 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is `len(unique_chars)`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 2, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the string `s` with `char` inserted at index 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is `len(unique_chars)`.**
