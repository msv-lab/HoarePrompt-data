Postcondition: **`x` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `n` is updated to the value provided by the input, `q` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`, `ans` is 1, the value of `t` remains unchanged, `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), and `(x - n * i)` is non-negative and divisible by `i` (i.e., `(x - n * i) % i == 0`).**
