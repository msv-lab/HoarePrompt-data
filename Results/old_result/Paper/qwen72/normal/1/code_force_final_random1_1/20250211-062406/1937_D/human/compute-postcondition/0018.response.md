Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `idx_A` is `[1]` if `s[0]` is '>', otherwise `idx_A` is `[0, 1]`, and `A` is `[x, x + 1]` if `s[0]` is '>', otherwise `A` and `idx_A` are `[0, 1]` and the code snippet will raise an error.**
