Output State: **`l` is 1, `q` is greater than 1, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the element at index `s` in the list `a` is equal to `ql`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.** 

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the conditions specified in the initial state still hold true.
