To determine what will be printed by the `print(final[0])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `lst` contains indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50.
   - `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`.
   - `elem` is the last element processed in `lst`.
   - If the length of `final` is 0, then `final` contains either the element 0 (if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50) or the value `n` (if `c1` is less than 50).

2. **Understanding `final`**:
   - `final` is a sorted list of elements from `lst` that meet a specific condition (absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`).
   - If `final` is empty, it is populated with either 0 or `n` based on the value of `c1`.

3. **Determining the Output**:
   - The `print(final[0])` statement will print the first element of the `final` list.
   - If `final` is not empty, it will print the first element of the sorted list.
   - If `final` is empty, it will be populated with either 0 or `n` based on the value of `c1`.

Given the initial state, we need to consider two scenarios:

### Scenario 1: `final` is not empty
- In this case, `final` contains elements from `lst` that meet the condition.
- The first element of `final` will be printed.

### Scenario 2: `final` is empty
- In this case, `final` will be populated with either 0 or `n` based on the value of `c1`.
- If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` will contain 0.
- If `c1` is less than 50, `final` will contain `n`.

### Conclusion
Since the exact values of `c1` and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the conditions given:

- If `final` is not empty, the output will be the first element of `final`.
- If `final` is empty, the output will be either 0 or `n` based on the value of `c1`.

Therefore, the output can be described as:

Output: **final[0] (where final[0] is the first element of the sorted list `final` if it is not empty, or 0 if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, or `n` if `c1` is less than 50)**
