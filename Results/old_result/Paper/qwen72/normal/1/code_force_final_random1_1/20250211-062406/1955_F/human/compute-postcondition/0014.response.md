To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `p_i` are integers such that \(0 \leq p_i \leq 200\).
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations.
   - `cnt` is calculated as follows:
     - If the first three elements of `a` are equal and are odd numbers, add 1 to `cnt`.
     - For each element in `a`, perform floor division by 2 and add the result to `cnt`.

2. **Calculation of `cnt`:**
   - **Step 1:** Check if the first three elements of `a` are equal and are odd numbers.
     - If they are, add 1 to `cnt`.
   - **Step 2:** For each element in `a`, perform floor division by 2 and add the result to `cnt`.

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `a = [3, 3, 3, 6, 9, 12]`.
     - The first three elements are `[3, 3, 3]`, which are equal and odd. So, add 1 to `cnt`.
     - Perform floor division for each element:
       - \(3 // 2 = 1\)
       - \(3 // 2 = 1\)
       - \(3 // 2 = 1\)
       - \(6 // 2 = 3\)
       - \(9 // 2 = 4\)
       - \(12 // 2 = 6\)
     - Sum of these results: \(1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16\)
     - Add the initial 1 from the first three elements: \(16 + 1 = 17\)
     - Therefore, `cnt` is 17.

4. **General Case:**
   - The value of `cnt` depends on the specific elements in the list `a`.
   - If the first three elements are equal and odd, `cnt` starts with 1.
   - Otherwise, `cnt` starts with 0.
   - For each element in `a`, `cnt` is incremented by the result of the floor division of that element by 2.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(cnt)` statement will print the value of `cnt` as calculated above.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of 1 (if the first three elements of `a` are equal and are odd numbers) plus the floor division of each element in `a` by 2)**
