Output State: **_ is incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `a` are updated to the values from the tuple `test_cases[_]`, `a` is a non-empty iterable with no elements remaining, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where each integer represents the count of corresponding characters (A to G) in `a`, `missing` is recalculated as the sum of the differences `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, `results` now includes the value of `missing` as its last element, `prob` is the last element of `a`.**

Explanation:
- The line `results.append(missing)` appends the current value of `missing` to the list `results`.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `freq`, `missing`, `prob`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The output state reflects the updated `results` list with the new value of `missing` appended to it, while all other conditions and values remain the same as described in the initial state.
