The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts no direct parameters but expects input in a specific format that includes the number of test cases `t`, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each test case, it expects an integer `n` where `3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, representing the number of elements in an array `a`. The array `a` consists of `n` integers, each ranging from `0` to `10^9`. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases should not exceed `2 · 10^5`.

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. However, the specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not specified in the given information.**
