Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is 1 if `s[i]` is '>', otherwise `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` if `s[i]` is '>', otherwise `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `a` is `A[l]`.**
