Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program sorts the array and prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements (`a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`). However, this approach does not consider the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2 1 3
```
The correct output should be 2, as explained in the problem statement. However, the program will output 2 - 1 = 1, which is incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, the array should be sorted, and the beauty should be calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting. The correct approach would be:
```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        beauty = sum(a[i] - a[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)
```
