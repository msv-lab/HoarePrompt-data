Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where the elements at indices `p` and `k-1` have been swapped, `h` is equal to the first element of `s` (which is now the original first element), `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that was compared with `h` before the loop broke or completed, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` starting from the second element up to the point where `h` is no longer greater than or equal to the current element `i` in the loop, `p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the last element of `s` that was compared with `h` before the loop broke or completed. If any element in `s` equals `h` and `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is the count of such occurrences. If any element in `s` is greater than `h`, the loop breaks and `z` remains 1. If no element in `s` is greater than `h` and `z` is 1, `ans1` is the count of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` after the first occurrence of `h`. Otherwise, `ans1` remains 0 and `z` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates through each element `i` in the list `s`.
- If `i` equals `h` and `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is incremented.
- If `i` is greater than `h`, the loop breaks immediately.
- If `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is 1, `ans1` is incremented.
- The variable `z` is set to 1 when the first occurrence of `h` is found.
- The loop continues until it either breaks due to an element being greater than `h` or completes the iteration through `s`.
- After the loop, `i` will be the last element that was compared with `h` before the loop broke or completed.
- The final value of `ans1` will be the count of elements that meet the conditions described above.
