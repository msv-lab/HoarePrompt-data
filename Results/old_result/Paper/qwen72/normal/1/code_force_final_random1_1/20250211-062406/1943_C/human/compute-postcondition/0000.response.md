Output State: **No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads input from stdin, where the first input is an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree. The value of `n` is now a specific integer. The subsequent inputs (n-1 lines) are still expected to contain pairs of integers representing edges between vertices.**
