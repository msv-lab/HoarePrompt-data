To determine what will be printed by the `print('\n'.join(results))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the implications of the variables and objects involved:

1. **Initial State Summary**:
   - `t` is 0, meaning there are no more test cases to process.
   - `n` retains the value of the last assigned `n`, which is the size of the array for the last test case.
   - `q` is 0, indicating no additional queries beyond the main processing.
   - `idx` is increased by the total number of elements processed in `data` (which is `t * (n + 2 + q * 2)`). Since `t` is 0, this means `idx` is not affected by any further processing.
   - `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the corresponding integer value from `data` for the last test case.
   - `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index for the last test case.
   - `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values in `pf` and values being lists of indices where these `pf` values occur for the last test case.
   - `results` contains the final results of the loop's operations ('YES' or 'NO' for each query across all test cases).
   - The last element of `results` is an empty string.

2. **Understanding `results`**:
   - `results` is a list that contains the results of the loop's operations for each test case.
   - Each element in `results` is either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on the outcome of the queries for each test case.
   - The last element of `results` is explicitly mentioned as an empty string.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - The `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will join all elements of the `results` list into a single string, separated by newline characters (`\n`).
   - Since the last element of `results` is an empty string, it will result in an extra newline at the end of the output.

Given the above, the output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each on a new line, followed by an extra newline due to the empty string at the end of `results`.

Output: **[sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each on a new line, followed by an extra newline]**
