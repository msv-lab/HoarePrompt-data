Output State: **`n` and `m` are the input integers, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `int(n / 3)`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g` remain unchanged. However, the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently executing.
