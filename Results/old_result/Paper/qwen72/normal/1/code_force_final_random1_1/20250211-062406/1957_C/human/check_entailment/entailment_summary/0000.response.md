Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Recursion Limit**: The program starts by setting the recursion limit to 400,000, which is necessary because the dynamic programming (DP) table is being precomputed up to 300,000. This ensures that the program can handle large values of `n`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The DP table `dp` is initialized with `-1` values, indicating that the values have not been computed yet. The function `func_1` is called to precompute the DP table up to 300,000.

3. **Precomputation Function (`func_1`)**:
   - `dp[1]` is set to 1, which represents the base case where there is only one way to place a rook on a 1x1 board.
   - `dp[2]` is set to 3, which represents the number of ways to place rooks on a 2x2 board without attacking each other.
   - For `i` from 3 to `n`, the DP table is filled using the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. This recurrence relation correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on an `i x i` board, considering the constraints of the problem.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the board `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and adds the rows and columns of these moves to a set `invalid` to keep track of the positions that are already occupied.
   - Finally, it prints the number of possible final configurations, which is `dp[n - len(invalid)]`. This value is computed using the precomputed DP table and adjusted for the number of invalid positions.

5. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The precomputation of the DP table ensures that the values are computed efficiently and reused for multiple test cases.
   - The logic for handling the invalid positions and computing the final configurations is correct and follows the problem's constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
