Output State: **`mp` is updated to `{(0): [0]}`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a[1]` is set to `int(data[idx-1])`, `idx` is incremented by 1, all other variables (`t`, `q`, `data`, `a`, `pf`, `results`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`) remain unchanged.** 

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their previous values. The specific value of `a[1]` is determined by the previous value of `idx` before the increment.
