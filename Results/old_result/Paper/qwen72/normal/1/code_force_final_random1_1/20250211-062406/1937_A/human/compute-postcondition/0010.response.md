The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. If `power` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 2 and `n` is the log2 of the input integer (with the input integer being greater than 2).

For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must remain less than `n`. Since `power` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. Given that `n` is the log2 of the input integer, and the input integer must be greater than 2, `n` will indeed be greater than 1, but to ensure the loop executes again, `n` must be greater than 2.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` is log2 of the input integer (input integer must be greater than 2), `power` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2**
