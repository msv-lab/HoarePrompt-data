Postcondition: **After all iterations of the loop, `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`. `numbers` is an empty list. `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` contain the elements from the original `numbers` list distributed according to the `distribute_number` function. `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are the sums of the elements in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`, respectively. Additionally, the function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` returns `True`.**
