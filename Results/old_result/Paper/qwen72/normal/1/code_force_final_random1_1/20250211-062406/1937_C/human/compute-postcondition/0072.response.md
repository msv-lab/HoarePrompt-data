Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 1 if no such `i` exists.
   - `res` is an input string.
   - If `res` is '<', `best` is 2. Otherwise, `best` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `k` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` contains a '<' at any point, `k` will be the last value of `i` where this occurred. If `res` does not contain a '<', `k` will be 1.
   - `best` is 2 if `res` is '<'. Otherwise, `best` is 0.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - **Scenario 1:** If `res` contains a '<' at some point, let's say the last occurrence of '<' was at `i = 3` (or any other value), then `k` will be that value. For simplicity, let's assume the last '<' was at `i = 3`.
     - In this case, `k` is 3.
     - `best` is 2.
   - **Scenario 2:** If `res` does not contain a '<', then:
     - `k` is 1.
     - `best` is 0.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `res` contains a '<' and the last occurrence is at `i = 3`:
     Output: **? 3 2 3 3**
   - If `res` does not contain a '<':
     Output: **? 1 0 1 3**

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both scenarios. However, the most precise answer based on the given information is:

Output: **? [k] [best] [k] 3 (where [k] is the last value of i for which res was '<', or 1 if no such i exists, and [best] is 2 if res is '<', otherwise 0)**
