No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads input from stdin, where the first input is an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, followed by `n - 1` lines, each containing two integers `u` and `v` representing an edge between vertices `u` and `v`. The vertices are 1-indexed, and the edges form a tree.
