To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the user.
- `x` is 3.
- `y` is 1.
- `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
- `n` must be at least 12.
- `m` must be at least 4.
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `(x + y) * x` and `(x + y) * y`:**
   - `x` is 3.
   - `y` is 1.
   - `(x + y) * x = (3 + 1) * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12`.
   - `(x + y) * y = (3 + 1) * 1 = 4 * 1 = 4`.

2. **Evaluate the expressions `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`:**
   - `n / ((x + y) * x) = n / 12`.
   - `m // ((x + y) * y) = m // 4`.

3. **Determine the minimum of the two values:**
   - `min(n / 12, m // 4)`.

4. **Update `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is incremented by the minimum value calculated above.

### Output State:
- `n` and `m` remain the same.
- `x` remains 3.
- `y` remains 1.
- `cnt` is incremented by `min(n / 12, m // 4)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the user, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `cnt` is incremented by `min(n / 12, m // 4)`, `n` must be at least 12, `m` must be at least 4, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.**
