Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  Reads an integer from standard input and returns this integer. The function does not accept any parameters. After the function concludes, the program has read an integer from the user and the function returns this integer.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads a line from standard input, splits the line into parts based on whitespace, converts each part to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the caller receives a map object that can be iterated over to access the integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
'''

After the function concludes, the program has a list of integers derived from the input line.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `rows_number`, which is a non-negative integer, and returns a list containing the results of calling `func_3()` `rows_number` times. If `rows_number` is 0, an empty list is returned. The function does not modify any external state or variables.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
'''

Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` reads the next line from standard input (stdin), strips any trailing whitespace, decodes the bytes to a string, and returns this string. It does not accept any parameters.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, where the input is expected to be a space-separated string of integers. The function then converts this string into a list of integers and returns this list. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has a list of integers derived from the user's input.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a non-negative integer `rows` and returns a list of length `rows`. Each element in the list is the result of calling the function `func_7()`. The specific values of the elements depend on the implementation of `func_7()`. After the function concludes, the program has a list of length `rows` containing the results of `func_7()`.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user for input and returns the input provided by the user. After the function concludes, the program has returned the user's input.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to input a value, converts that input into an integer, and returns the integer value. After the function concludes, the program has returned an integer value entered by the user.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the standard input, splits the input into a list of strings based on whitespace, and returns this list. After the function concludes, the program has a list of strings derived from the user's input.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` takes four parameters: a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of integers, an integer `da` which is a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers. The function updates the `rank` list and returns an integer value. If the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed yet (as indicated by the `processing` list), updating the `rank` list and returning the minimum value found plus 1. The `processing` list is used to track which elements have been processed during the recursion, and it is reset after each recursive call.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, where at least one of them is not zero. It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` such that `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, and `x` and `y` are coefficients satisfying the equation `a*x + b*y = g`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively computes the values using the Euclidean algorithm. After the function concludes, the final state is that the GCD of `a` and `b` is computed, and the coefficients `x` and `y` are determined such that the linear combination of `a` and `b` equals the GCD.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, its length `n`, a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the list `a` and for each element that is less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference between `m` and the element. After processing all elements, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function modifies `k` based on the elements of `a` and returns a value indicating whether `k` is non-negative or negative after the adjustments.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It calculates and returns a value based on a specific formula involving the smallest integer `i` greater than 1 such that \( i^2 > n + i \). The returned value is `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of \((n + j) // (j * j)\) for all \( j \) from 1 to \( i - 1 \). After the function concludes, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the function returns the computed value.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It executes a loop that runs `func_10()` times, where in each iteration, it prints the result of `func_15()` to the console. After the function completes, the console will contain the output of `func_15()` printed `func_10()` times, each on a new line.
