Functionality: **The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters but operates within an environment where it can make queries about a hidden permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. It returns two indices i and j such that the XOR of the elements at these indices in the permutation is maximized, using at most 3n queries. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with a different permutation, and ensures that the total number of test cases and the sum of n across all test cases are bounded.**
