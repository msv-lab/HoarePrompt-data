Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of elements in the array. The array a consists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = int(input())
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1
        ] + 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, and `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string. If the first element of `b` is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or the last element of `b` is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2, then the condition in the if part is true. Otherwise, the first element of `b` is even or the second element of `b` is equal to the first element plus 2, and the last element of `b` is even or the second-to-last element of `b` is equal to the last element plus 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string, and the loop will continue to execute as long as the current value of `_` is less than the value of `t`. If the first element of `b` is odd and the second element is not two more than the first, or if the last element of `b` is odd and the second-to-last element is not two more than the last, the if part's conditions hold. Otherwise, the else part's conditions hold.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string, and the loop will continue to execute as long as the current value of `_` is less than the value of `t`. If `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2` or `(b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2)`, the same conditions hold true. Otherwise, the same conditions also hold true.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
