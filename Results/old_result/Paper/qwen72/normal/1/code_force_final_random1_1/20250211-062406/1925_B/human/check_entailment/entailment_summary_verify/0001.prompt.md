You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import sqrt

def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`. It then calculates the largest divisor `ans` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, where `i` is a divisor of `x` within the range from 1 to the square root of `x`. If no such divisor exists, `ans` remains 1. The function prints the value of `ans` for each test case. The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` are not modified during the function's execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of a set of `n` positive integers whose sum is `x`. This GCD is referred to as the "balance" of the problem set.

2. **Key Insight**: The GCD of a set of numbers is maximized when the numbers are as evenly distributed as possible. If `x` is divisible by `n`, then the optimal solution is to have all sub-problems with difficulty `x // n`, making the GCD `x // n`.

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program iterates over all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x` can be divided into `n` parts where each part has a difficulty that is a multiple of `i`.
   - It also checks the corresponding divisor `x // i` to ensure it covers all possible divisors.
   - The maximum GCD found during this process is stored in `ans`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n = 1`, the GCD is simply `x` because the problem set consists of a single problem.
   - When `x` is not divisible by `n`, the program still finds the largest divisor that can be used to form the sub-problems.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses a loop that runs up to the square root of `x`, which is efficient for the given constraints (`1 <= x <= 10^8`).

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases.
   - It efficiently finds the maximum GCD by checking all possible divisors up to the square root of `x`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
