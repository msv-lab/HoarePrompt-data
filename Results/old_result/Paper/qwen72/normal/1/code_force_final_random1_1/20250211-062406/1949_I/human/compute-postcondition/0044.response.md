The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the context provided, it seems to operate on predefined lists `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`. The function's behavior is expected to process these lists according to the given constraints and relationships.

Given the constraints:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000.
- `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers where for each i (0 ≤ i < n), `x[i]` and `y[i]` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x[i], y[i] ≤ 10^9, and `r[i]` is an integer such that 1 ≤ r[i] ≤ 10^9.
- `visited` is a list of booleans initialized to False for each element.
- `coef` is a list of None values, which will later be assigned integer values.

Since the function does not return any value explicitly mentioned, it is likely that the function modifies the `visited` and `coef` lists in place.

Functionality: **The function processes lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` based on the integer `n`, where `n` is the length of these lists. It updates the `visited` list to mark elements as visited and assigns integer values to the `coef` list.**
