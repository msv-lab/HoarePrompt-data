Postcondition: **The loop will terminate when `i` reaches `n - 3` or when `a[i]` becomes less than 0 for any `i`. The final state of the array `a` will depend on the values of `a` and the number of iterations. Specifically, `a[i]` will be updated as follows: `a[i] -= a[i]`, `a[i + 1] -= 2 * a[i]`, and `a[i + 2] -= a[i]` for each iteration `i` from 0 to `n - 3`. If any `a[i]` becomes less than 0 during the process, the loop will break, and `stop` will be set to True. Currently, `stop` is True, indicating that the loop has terminated due to an element in `a` becoming less than 0.**
