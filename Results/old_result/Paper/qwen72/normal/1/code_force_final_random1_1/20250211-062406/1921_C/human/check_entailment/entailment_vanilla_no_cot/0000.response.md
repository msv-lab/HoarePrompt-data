Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The logic in the provided program is flawed in several ways:

1. **Charge Calculation for Continuous Operation**: The program attempts to calculate the total charge used by the phone when it operates continuously between messages. However, it incorrectly assumes that the phone should be turned off and on if the time difference between two consecutive messages is less than `b/a`. This is not always the optimal strategy. The phone should be turned off and on only if doing so saves more charge than keeping it on.

2. **Incorrect Charge Calculation for Off/On Cycles**: The program calculates the charge used for turning the phone off and on as `(n - len(array2)) * b`, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should consider the actual times when the phone is turned off and on, and the charge consumed during these periods.

3. **Summing Up Charge Usage**: The program sums up the charge used for continuous operation and the charge used for turning the phone off and on, but it does not correctly account for the initial charge and the charge used during the entire process.

A correct approach would involve:
- Calculating the charge used if the phone is kept on continuously.
- Determining the optimal points to turn the phone off and on to save charge.
- Ensuring the total charge used does not exceed the initial charge.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initial charge after the first message
        remaining_charge = f - arr[0] * a
        
        if remaining_charge <= 0:
            print('No')
            continue
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
            charge_used_continuous = time_diff * a
            charge_used_turn_off_on = b
            
            if charge_used_continuous > charge_used_turn_off_on:
                remaining_charge -= charge_used_turn_off_on
            else:
                remaining_charge -= charge_used_continuous
            
            if remaining_charge <= 0:
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('Yes')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the phone is turned off and on only when it saves more charge, and it correctly calculates the remaining charge after each message.
