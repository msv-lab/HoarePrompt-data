The value of `sm` is updated to `2 ** k * sm - sm`. This simplifies to `sm * (2 ** k - 1)`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `suf`, `smin`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` remains greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index, `sm` is now `sm * (2 ** k - 1)`**.
