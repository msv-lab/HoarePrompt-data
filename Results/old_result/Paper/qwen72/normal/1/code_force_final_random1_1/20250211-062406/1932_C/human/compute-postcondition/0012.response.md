The code `b.append(a[l])` appends the element at index `l` of the list `a` to the list `b`. Let's break down the impact of this code on the program:

- `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `b` is updated by appending the element `a[l]` to it.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `r` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- If `s[0]` is 'L', `b` initially contains the first element of `a`, and `l` is 1.
- If `s[0]` is 'R', `b` initially contains the last element of `a`, and `l` is 0.

After executing the code:
- If `s[0]` is 'L', `b` now contains the first element of `a` and the second element of `a`.
- If `s[0]` is 'R', `b` now contains the last element of `a` and the first element of `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing the first element of `a` and the second element of `a` if `s[0]` is 'L' or the last element of `a` and the first element of `a` if `s[0]` is 'R', `l` is 1 if `s[0]` is 'L' or remains 0 if `s[0]` is 'R', `r` is `n - 1` if `s[0]` is 'L' or `n - 2` if `s[0]` is 'R', and `i` is 1.**
