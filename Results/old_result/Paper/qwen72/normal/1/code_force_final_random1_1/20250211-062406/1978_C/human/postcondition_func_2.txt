The function `func_3` takes a positive integer `c` and a list of integers `l` with at least 2c elements. It swaps the elements at index `c - 1` and index `-c` in the list `l`. The function returns the modified list `l`, where the elements at these two indices have been swapped, while all other elements in the list remain unchanged.
