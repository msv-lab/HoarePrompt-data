To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case.
- `N` is 200001.
- `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0.
- `pd[i]` (where `i` is `N`) is now the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N`.
- `i` is `N`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, N):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `N-1` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `N-1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

### Adjustments:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- Since the loop iterates from 1 to `N-1`, the next value of `i` should be `N`.

### Final State:
- `i` is incremented to `N`.
- The loop will not execute again because `i` will be equal to `N`, and the condition `i < N` will no longer be true.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0, `pd[i]` (where `i` is `N`) is now the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N`, `i` is `N`**.
