Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, A is an empty list, idx_A is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if len(idx_A) == 0:
            A.append(0)
        else:
            x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
            A.append(x)
        idx_A.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0. If the first character of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is '>', then `idx_A` is a list containing `[0]`. If `len(idx_A) == 0`, then `A` is [0] and `idx_A` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `A` is a list containing one element `[x]`, `idx_A` is not empty, and `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 1] + (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`. If the first character of `s` is not '>', then `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged as empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the first character of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is '>', then `idx_A` is `[1]` and `A` is `[x, x + 1]` where `x` is the last element of `A` before the update. If the first character of `s` is not '>', then `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged as empty lists. If `s[1]` is '>', then `idx_A` is updated to `[1]` and `A` is updated to `[x, x + 1]` if `s[0]` is '>', otherwise `idx_A` is `[0, 1]` and `A` is `[0, 1]`. If `s[1]` is not '>', then `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `s[2]` is '>', then `idx_A` is `[1, 2]` if `s[0]` is '>' and `s[1]` is '>', otherwise `idx_A` is `[0, 1, 2]` if `s[0]` is not '>' and `s[1]` is '>', and `idx_A` remains `[1]` if `s[1]` is not '>' and `s[0]` is '>'. `A` remains `[0]` if `s[0]` is '>' and `s[1]` is '>', otherwise `A` is `[0, 1]` if `s[0]` is not '>' and `s[1]` is '>', and `A` remains unchanged as an empty list if `s[0]` and `s[1]` are not '>' and `len(idx_A) != 0`. If `s[2]` is not '>', `idx_A` and `A` remain unchanged from their previous states.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
