To solve this, let's go through the steps:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` must be at least 15.
   - `m` must be at least 10.
   - `x` is 3.
   - `y` is 2.
   - `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / 12` and `m // 4` if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is 1.

2. **Calculate GCD of `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` is 3.
   - `y` is 2.
   - The GCD of 3 and 2 is 1.

3. **Determine the initial value of `cnt`**:
   - Since the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1, we calculate `cnt` as the sum of the minimum of `n / 12` and `m // 4`.
   - `n / 12` is at least `15 / 12` which is approximately 1.25.
   - `m // 4` is at least `10 // 4` which is 2.
   - The minimum of 1.25 and 2 is 1.25.
   - Therefore, `cnt` is initially 1.25.

4. **Update `cnt`**:
   - The code snippet updates `cnt` by adding the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
   - Calculate `x + y`: `3 + 2` is 5.
   - Calculate `(x + y) * x`: `5 * 3` is 15.
   - Calculate `(x + y) * y`: `5 * 2` is 10.
   - Calculate `n / 15`: Since `n` is at least 15, `n / 15` is at least `15 / 15` which is 1.
   - Calculate `m // 10`: Since `m` is at least 10, `m // 10` is at least `10 // 10` which is 1.
   - The minimum of 1 and 1 is 1.
   - Therefore, `cnt` is updated by adding 1 to its current value of 1.25, resulting in `cnt` being 2.25.

5. **Final Output State**:
   - `n` must be at least 15.
   - `m` must be at least 10.
   - `x` is 3.
   - `y` is 2.
   - `cnt` is 2.25.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 15, `m` must be at least 10, `x` is 3, `y` is 2, `cnt` is 2.25.**
