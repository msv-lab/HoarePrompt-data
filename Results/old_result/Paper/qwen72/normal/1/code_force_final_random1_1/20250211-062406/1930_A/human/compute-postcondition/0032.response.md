Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is now equal to the sum of the first and third elements of `l`, `i` is 2, and `2 * n` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation: The code `score += l[i]` adds the value of the third element of the list `l` (since `i` is 2) to the current value of `score`. Initially, `score` was equal to the first element of `l`. After the addition, `score` is now the sum of the first and third elements of `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
