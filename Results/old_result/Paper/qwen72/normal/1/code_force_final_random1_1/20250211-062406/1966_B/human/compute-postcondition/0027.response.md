Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `m` is the input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'NO', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is `m-2`. If any pair of consecutive characters in the first string of `gr` or the last string of `gr` are not equal, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` is `True`. The current value of `impossible` is `True`.**
