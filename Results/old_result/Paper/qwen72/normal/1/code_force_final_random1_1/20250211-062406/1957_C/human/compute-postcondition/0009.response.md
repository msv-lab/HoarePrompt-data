The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer representing the size of the chessboard, with the constraint that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5. However, the provided output section does not specify what the function returns based on the input `n`. Without this information, I cannot fully describe the functionality of the function.

If you can provide the expected output or behavior of the function based on the input `n`, I can complete the description. For now, here is the partial description:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the size of the chessboard, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5. The function's return value is not specified.**
