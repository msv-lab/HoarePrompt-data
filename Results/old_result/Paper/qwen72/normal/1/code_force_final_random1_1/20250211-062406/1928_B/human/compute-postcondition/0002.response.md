To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `arr`.
2. **Range Function**: The `range` function is used with three arguments:
   - `start`: `len(arr) - 1`
   - `stop`: `-1` (exclusive)
   - `step`: `-1` (decrementing)

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if `start` is greater than or equal to `stop` when considering the step direction.
   - In this case, `start` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `stop` is `-1` with a step of `-1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `len(arr) - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - `arr` must have at least one element for the loop to execute. This means `len(arr)` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` will start at `len(arr) - 1`.

### Final State:
- `arr` must be a list of integers with at least one element.
- `i` will start at `len(arr) - 1`.
- `ans` remains an empty list.
- `tem` remains 1.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**
