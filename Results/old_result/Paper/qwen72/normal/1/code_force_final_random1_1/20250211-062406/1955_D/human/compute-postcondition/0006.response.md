The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should start at 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
