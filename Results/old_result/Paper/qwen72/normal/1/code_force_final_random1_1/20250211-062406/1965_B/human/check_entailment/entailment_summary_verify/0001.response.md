### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires generating a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence must ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - For all values `v` from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`), there should be a subsequence that sums to `v`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_14**: This function is responsible for generating the required sequence based on the given `n` and `k`.
     - **Special Case Handling**:
       - If `k == 1`, it handles the special case where `n == 2` separately by returning "1\n2".
       - For other values of `n`, it initializes the sequence with `[2, 3]` and appends additional powers of 2 to cover all values up to `n`.
     - **General Case Handling**:
       - For `k > 1`, it constructs the sequence by including powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`.
       - It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum condition is met.
       - Additional values like `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` are added to cover the remaining range.
   - **func_15**: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_14` for each test case, printing the results.

3. **Special Case Handling**:
   - The special case where `k == 1` is handled correctly. For `n == 2`, the sequence `[2]` is returned, which meets the conditions.
   - For other values of `n`, the sequence `[2, 3]` and additional powers of 2 are used to cover all values up to `n`.

4. **General Case Handling**:
   - The general case where `k > 1` is also handled correctly. The sequence is constructed to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` while covering all other values from 1 to `n`.
   - The use of powers of 2 and specific adjustments ensures that the sequence meets the required conditions.

5. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is constructed to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` while covering all other values from 1 to `n`.
   - The sequence is limited to a maximum size of 25, which is within the problem constraints.

6. **Output Validation**:
   - The function prints the sequence in the required format, ensuring it meets the problem constraints.
   - The output format is correct, with the first line containing the size of the sequence and the second line containing the elements of the sequence.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly generates the required sequence for the given problem. It handles both special and general cases appropriately and ensures that the sequence meets all the specified conditions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
