To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, so it doesn't need to be initialized before the loop starts.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a specific integer.
- `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. The state of `u2vs` and the fact that no variables are passed to the function `func_2` do not affect the loop's ability to execute, but they are part of the initial state.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists**
