To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. The variable `i` is initialized by the `range` function, starting from 0.
2. The loop will execute if the value passed to `range` is greater than 0.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.

However, these variables (`t`, `a`, and `b`) are not directly involved in the loop head. The only relevant variable for the loop to execute is the result of `int(input())`.

For the loop to execute, the input provided to `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure this condition is met.

State: **`i` is 0, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
