The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop context is provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement would typically be used within a loop structure. Without a loop, the `continue` statement would cause a syntax error. Assuming the `continue` is part of a loop, the variables remain unchanged, but the control flow moves to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `total_points` is equal to the sum of the elements of the next tuple (p1 + p2 + p3), `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is equal to the sum of the next tuple's elements minus 2 * (next p3 - next p2) - 2 * (next p3 - next p1). If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`. We move to the next iteration of the loop.**
