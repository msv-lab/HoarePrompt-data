You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). It then calculates a value `ans` starting from `n` and incrementing it based on a loop that runs from 2 to `m`. The loop modifies `ans` by adding a computed value derived from `n` and the current loop index. After processing all test cases, the function prints the final value of `ans` for each test case. The state after the function concludes includes `t` remaining unchanged, `n` and `m` being the last input values for the final test case, and `ans` being the final calculated value for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), we need to analyze the relationship between \(a\) and \(b\).
   - If \(b = 1\), then \(a + 1\) must be a multiple of \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\), which is always true. Therefore, all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid.
   - For \(b > 1\), we need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The given program initializes `ans` with `n`, which accounts for all pairs \((a, 1)\).
   - It then iterates over possible values of \(b\) starting from 2 up to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values using the formula:
     - `countmins = count - 1`
     - `g = n // count`
     - If `g < countmins`, it breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it updates `ans` with `g // count + 1`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the base case where \(b = 1\).
   - For \(b > 1\), the logic seems to be attempting to count valid \(a\) values, but the specific formula used is not clearly derived from the problem statement.
   - The condition `if g < countmins` and the update `ans += g // count + 1` are not straightforward and may not correctly count all valid pairs.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The logic for counting valid pairs when \(b > 1\) is not clear and may not be correct.
   - The formula `g // count + 1` does not directly correspond to the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The specific formula used for counting valid pairs when \(b > 1\) is not derived from the problem statement and may lead to incorrect results.
