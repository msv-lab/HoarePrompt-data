Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It processes each test case by reading the number of pairs `n`, then reading and sorting the list of `2n` integers. By sorting the list, the smallest elements are positioned at the beginning, ensuring that when we take every second element starting from the first, we are always taking the minimum of each pair. This approach guarantees the maximum possible score because the smallest elements are used in the score calculation, which maximizes the use of the smaller values in the pairs.

The loop iterates over the sorted list, incrementing the score by the value at every even index (starting from 0), which corresponds to the minimum of each pair in the sorted list. The program then prints the score for each test case, which is the correct output format as specified in the problem statement.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program handles all edge cases and performs efficiently within the given limits. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
