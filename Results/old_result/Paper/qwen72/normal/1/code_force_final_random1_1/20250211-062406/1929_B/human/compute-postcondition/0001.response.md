The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop's execution depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`n` and `k`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
