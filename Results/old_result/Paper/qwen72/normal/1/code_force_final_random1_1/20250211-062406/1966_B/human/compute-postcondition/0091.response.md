The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. This changes the values of `n` and `m` from their initial states to the new input values.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `tc` is 2
- `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1)
- `m` is the new input integer
- `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings
- `i` is `n-1`
- `j` is `m-2`
- If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, then `ans` is 'NO' if `impossible` is `True`, or 'YES' if any pair of adjacent characters in the first string or the last string of `gr` are different, or if any pair of adjacent strings in `gr` have different first or last characters. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES' and `impossible` remains `False`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` is now the first integer from the input
- `m` is now the second integer from the input

The rest of the variables (`t`, `tc`, `gr`, `i`, `j`, `ans`, and `impossible`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input (greater than 1), `m` is the second integer from the input, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`. If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, then `ans` is 'NO' if `impossible` is `True`, or 'YES' if any pair of adjacent characters in the first string or the last string of `gr` are different, or if any pair of adjacent strings in `gr` have different first or last characters. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES' and `impossible` remains `False`.**
