Output State: **`custos` is a list containing the calculated costs for each of the `t` test cases and must have `t` elements.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `custos` will contain exactly `t` elements, where each element represents the calculated cost for one of the `t` test cases. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `i`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `nf`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
