Let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print(sm)` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `j` is 1.
- `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new user input split by whitespace.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in the new `b` and must be greater than 0.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element in the new `b`.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input split by whitespace.
- `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements starting with 0 and followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `smin` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the minimum cumulative sum up to that index in `suf`.
- `sm` is initially `suf[n] + 2`.

### Logic:
1. **Initial Value of `sm`:**
   - `sm` is initialized to `suf[n] + 2`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - If `sm` is less than 0, then:
     - `sm` is updated to `suf[n] + 2 + 1,000,000,007`.
     - `a` is set to 0.
   - Otherwise:
     - `sm` is updated to `(suf[n] + 2) % 1,000,000,007`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate `suf[n]`:**
   - `suf` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0.
   - `suf[n]` is the cumulative sum of the first `n` elements in `l`.

2. **Initial Value of `sm`:**
   - `sm = suf[n] + 2`.

3. **Check if `sm` is less than 0:**
   - If `suf[n] + 2 < 0`, then:
     - `sm = suf[n] + 2 + 1,000,000,007`.
   - Otherwise:
     - `sm = (suf[n] + 2) % 1,000,000,007`.

### Final Output:
- The value of `sm` will be either:
  - `suf[n] + 2 + 1,000,000,007` if `suf[n] + 2 < 0`.
  - `(suf[n] + 2) % 1,000,000,007` otherwise.

Since the exact values of `suf[n]` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these conditions.

Output: **sm (where sm is either `suf[n] + 2 + 1,000,000,007` if `suf[n] + 2 < 0`, or `(suf[n] + 2) % 1,000,000,007` otherwise)**
