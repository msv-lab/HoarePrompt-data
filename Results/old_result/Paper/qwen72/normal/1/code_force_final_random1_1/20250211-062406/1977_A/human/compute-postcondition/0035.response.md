Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, and `m` is the second integer from the new input. If `m` > `n`, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. If `m` ≤ `n`, and `m` equals `n - 1`, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. If `m` ≤ `n`, and `m` does not equal `n - 1`, and both `m` and `n` are even or either `m` or `n` is odd, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` also remain unchanged.***
