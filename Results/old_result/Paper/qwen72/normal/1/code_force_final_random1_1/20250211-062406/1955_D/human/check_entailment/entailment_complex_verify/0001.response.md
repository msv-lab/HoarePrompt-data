### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function initializes a list `cnt_b` to keep track of the frequency of elements in array `b`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Frequency Counting for Array `b`:**
   - The function updates the `cnt_b` list to count the occurrences of each element in `b`.

3. **Initial Subsegment Check:**
   - The function initializes `curr` to count the number of matching elements in the first subsegment of length `m` from array `a`.
   - It decrements the count in `cnt_b` for each element in this subsegment and increments `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is non-negative.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The function uses a sliding window approach to check each subsequent subsegment of length `m` in array `a`.
   - For each new element added to the window, it updates `cnt_b` and `curr` accordingly.
   - For each element removed from the window, it also updates `cnt_b` and `curr` accordingly.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` after updating, it increments the answer `ans`.

5. **Resetting Counts:**
   - After processing each test case, the function resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to prepare for the next test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correctness of Frequency Counting:**
  - The `cnt_b` list is correctly initialized and updated to reflect the frequency of elements in `b`.

- **Initial Subsegment Check:**
  - The initial subsegment check is correctly implemented. The function correctly decrements the count in `cnt_b` for each element in the first subsegment and increments `curr` if the count is non-negative.
  - The condition `if curr >= k` correctly checks if the initial subsegment is good and updates `ans` accordingly.

- **Sliding Window Approach:**
  - The sliding window approach is correctly implemented. The function efficiently updates the counts and the current number of matches (`curr`) as the window slides through the array `a`.
  - The conditions for updating `cnt_b` and `curr` when adding and removing elements from the window are correct.

- **Resetting Counts:**
  - The function correctly resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` after processing each test case, ensuring that the next test case starts with a clean slate.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the initialization, frequency counting, initial subsegment check, sliding window approach, and resetting counts accurately. The program meets the requirements of the problem statement and produces the correct output for the given examples.

### Final Answer:
