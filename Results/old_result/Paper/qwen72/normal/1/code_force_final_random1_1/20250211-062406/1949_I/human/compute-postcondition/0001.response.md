Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` and `r` are lists of integers where for each i (0 ≤ i < n), `y[i]` and `r[i]` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ y[i] ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ r[i] ≤ 10^9, `visited` is a list of booleans initialized to False for each element, and `coef` is a list of None values, which will later be assigned integer values.**
