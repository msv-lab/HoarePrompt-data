Output State: **`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `processing[di - 1]` is 1, `da` is an integer key present in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), the length of the list `d[da]` is greater than 1, `di` is the next integer in the list `d[da]`, `tmp` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`.**
