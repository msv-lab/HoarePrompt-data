Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, and `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. Additionally, either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`. Furthermore, either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is greater than `newk`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
