The value of `curr` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `curr` was 1, so now `curr` is 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is decreased by 1, if `a[1]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decreased by 1, if `cnt_b[a[1]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is 2, otherwise `curr` remains 2, if `a[1]` is not in `b_values`, `curr` remains 2.**
