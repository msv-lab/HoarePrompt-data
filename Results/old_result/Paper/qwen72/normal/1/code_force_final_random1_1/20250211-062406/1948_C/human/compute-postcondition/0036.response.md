Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the new integer input by the user, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a new string input by the user, and `i` is the last odd number less than `n`. The loop has completed all iterations without breaking if no conditions were met to break out of the loop. If any condition was met (i.e., `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`), the loop would have broken and printed 'No'. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it prints 'yes'.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be the last odd number less than `n`. The loop checks each odd index `i` from 1 up to `n-1` (if `n` is even) or `n-2` (if `n` is odd). If at any point the condition `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is true, the loop breaks and prints 'No'. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it prints 'yes'. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values.
