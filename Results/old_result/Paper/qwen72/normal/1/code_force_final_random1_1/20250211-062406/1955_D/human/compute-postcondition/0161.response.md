The code snippet `cnt_b[i] = 0` assigns the value 0 to the element at index `i` in the list `cnt_b`. The initial state specifies that `b_values` must contain at least one element, but `cnt_b` and `i` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. Assuming `cnt_b` is a list and `i` is a valid index within the bounds of `cnt_b`, the output state will reflect the updated value of `cnt_b[i]`.

Output State: **`b_values` must contain at least one element, `cnt_b[i]` is 0.**
