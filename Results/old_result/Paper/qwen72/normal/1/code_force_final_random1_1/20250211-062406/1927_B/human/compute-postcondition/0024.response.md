The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `l`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` being less than `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `l` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `j` becomes 2), and `l` must still be greater than `j` (so `l` must be greater than 2).

State: **`j` is 2, `l` must be greater than 2, `ans` is updated by appending `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`**
