Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, x and y are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = list(map(int, list(input())))
    b = list(map(int, list(input())))
    new = [None] * len(a)
    new2 = [None] * len(a)
    i = 0
    while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
        new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
        new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
        i += 1
    if i != len(a):
        new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
        new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
        i += 1
        while i < len(a):
            new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
    print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
    print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are lists of integers derived from the input strings, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9. If `i` is not equal to `len(a)`, `new` is a list where the first `i` elements are `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the rest are `None`, and `new2` is a list where the first `i` elements are `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the rest are `None`. If `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `new` is a list where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`, and `new2` is a list where each element is `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are still strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The lists `a` and `b` are unchanged, containing the digits from the input strings `x` and `y`, respectively. If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, the list `new` contains the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices up to `i-1`, and the remaining elements are `None`. Similarly, the list `new2` contains the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices up to `i-1`, and the remaining elements are `None`. If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, the list `new` contains the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices, and there are no `None` values left. The list `new2` contains the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices, and there are no `None` values left.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are still strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The list `a` is a list of integers corresponding to the digits of a new input string. The list `b` is updated to contain the digits from the new input string such that `b[i] == a[i]` for all `i` where `0 ≤ i < len(a)`. The list `new` is now a list of integers with the same length as `a`, where each element `new[i]` is set to the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The list `new2` is now a list of integers with the same length as `a`, where each element `new2[i]` is set to the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The variable `i` is now equal to `len(a)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
