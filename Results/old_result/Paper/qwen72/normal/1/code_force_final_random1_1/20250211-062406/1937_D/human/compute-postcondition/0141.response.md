Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is '>' or not, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `a` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is updated to `a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- All other variables (`j`, `i`, `idx_B`, `B`, `n`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `a` is calculated based on the initial value of `a` (which is `A[l - 1]`) plus the product of `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` and `l`.
