You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Output

    YES

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

The absolute value of the element at the index `sorted_indices[pos]` in `x` will still not be equal to `distance + 1`, assuming there are any monsters left with positive health. `distance` will be the final distance value after all iterations, which is the number of unique distances covered by the loop. The values of `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can kill all monsters before any of them reach the player's position (0).
   - Each second, we can fire up to `k` bullets at the monsters.
   - Monsters move 1 unit closer to the player each second.
   - If a monster reaches the player, the player loses.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1(a, x, k):**
     - This function takes the health of the monsters (`a`), their positions (`x`), and the number of bullets per second (`k`).
     - It sorts the monsters based on their distance from the player (using `abs(x[i])`).
     - It then iterates through the sorted list, attempting to kill the monsters before they reach the player.
     - The `distance` variable keeps track of how many seconds have passed.
     - The `pos` variable tracks the current position in the sorted list of monsters.
     - The inner loop fires bullets at the current monster until it is killed or the bullet limit is reached.
     - If a monster reaches the player (i.e., `abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`), the function returns `False`.
     - If all monsters are killed before reaching the player, the function returns `True`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where the number of monsters is greater than the number of bullets per second.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the monsters are already very close to the player.

4. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the result.

5. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound. It correctly simulates the process of firing bullets and moving monsters.
   - The sorting step ensures that we prioritize killing the closest monsters first, which is crucial for survival.
   - The function correctly checks if any monster reaches the player and returns the appropriate result.

The given program is correct and should work as expected for the provided problem description.
