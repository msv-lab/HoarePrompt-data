Output State: **_ is 0, `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l` starting with 0, `c` is a list containing the cumulative counts of 1s in `l` starting with 0, `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `j` is the count of 1s in `l`, `a` and `b` are the last input values for the indices, `s` is the sum of elements in the last processed sublist `l[a:b+1]`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `l`.
- For each iteration:
  - If `x` is 1, `j` (the count of 1s) is incremented.
  - `i` (the cumulative sum of elements) is incremented by `x`.
  - `p` (the list of cumulative sums) is updated with the new value of `i`.
  - `c` (the list of cumulative counts of 1s) is updated with the new value of `j`.
- After the loop completes:
  - `p` contains the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, starting with 0.
  - `c` contains the cumulative counts of 1s in `l`, starting with 0.
  - `i` is the total sum of all elements in `l`.
  - `j` is the total count of 1s in `l`.
- The variables `_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
