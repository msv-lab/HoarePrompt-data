### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Encoding Process**:
   - The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` from the distinct characters of the original string `s`, sorted alphabetically.
   - Each character in `s` is then replaced by its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - To decode, we need to reverse the encoding process. This means we need to create the same auxiliary string `r` and then map each character in the encoded string `b` back to its original position in `r`.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` to decode the string.
   - The function `func_1` creates a list of unique characters from the encoded string `b`, sorts them, and then attempts to replace each character in `b` with its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list.

4. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The logic inside the loop in `func_1` is incorrect. The loop iterates over each character in `s` and tries to replace it with the corresponding character from the end of the sorted list. However, it also modifies the `unique_chars` list by inserting characters, which is unnecessary and incorrect.
   - The `replace` method is used incorrectly. It replaces all occurrences of a character in the string, which can lead to incorrect results if the same character appears multiple times.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Create the sorted list of unique characters.
   - Create a mapping from each character in the sorted list to its symmetric counterpart.
   - Use this mapping to construct the decoded string.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly identifies and sorts the unique characters in the string `s`.
  - However, the loop logic is flawed. The function attempts to replace characters in the string `s` while also modifying the `unique_chars` list, which is incorrect.
  - The `replace` method is used in a way that can lead to incorrect results because it replaces all occurrences of a character, not just the current one being processed.

- **Correct Implementation**:
  - Instead of modifying the `unique_chars` list and using `replace`, the function should create a mapping from each character in the sorted list to its symmetric counterpart.
  - Then, use this mapping to construct the decoded string by iterating over the encoded string and replacing each character with its mapped value.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues in the current implementation, the program is indeed incorrect. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
