To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least 1 element.
- `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None` except `res[len(ar) - 1]` which is now `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`.
- `mex` is now equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`.
- `i` is `len(ar) - 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the list `ar` in reverse order, starting from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.
- The loop condition is that `i` must be greater than or equal to `0` for the loop to continue.

### Current State:
- `i` is `len(ar) - 1`.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1.
- The new value of `i` will be `len(ar) - 2`.

### Updated State:
- `i` is now `len(ar) - 2`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None` except `res[len(ar) - 1]` which is now `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `mex` is now equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, and `i` is `len(ar) - 2`.**
