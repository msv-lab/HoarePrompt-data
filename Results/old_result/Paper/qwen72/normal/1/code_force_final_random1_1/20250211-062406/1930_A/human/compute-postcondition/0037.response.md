Output State: **After all iterations, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the final input, `score` is the sum of every second element starting from the first element in `l` up to the last even-indexed element within the range of `2 * n`, `i` is `2 * n`, and `2 * n` is greater than 0. The loop has completed all its iterations for all `t` test cases.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed for all `t` test cases, the variable `t` remains within its original bounds, `n` is still a valid input integer, `l` is the sorted list of integers from the last test case, `score` contains the sum of the elements at even indices in `l`, `i` is set to `2 * n` (indicating the loop has completed its iterations for the current test case), and `2 * n` is still greater than 0. The loop has successfully processed all `t` test cases, and the final `score` for each test case has been printed.
