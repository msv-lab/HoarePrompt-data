Postcondition: ***`n` remains greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index. If `sm` < 0, `sm` is updated to `sm * 2 + suf[n] + (abs(sm) // 10 + 1) * 10`. Otherwise, `sm` is updated to `sm % 10`.***
