Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\).
3. `x` is a new list of integers read from the input.
4. `a` is a list of length `n` where:
   - `a[0]` is 1000.
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is \(1000 + \text{sum}(x[:i])\).
5. `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
6. `i` is `n-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*a)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `a`:**
   - The first element of `a` is `a[0] = 1000`.
   - For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where \(1 \leq i < n\)), the value is calculated as \(1000 + \text{sum}(x[:i])\).

2. **Understanding `a[i]` Calculation:**
   - `a[1] = 1000 + \text{sum}(x[:1]) = 1000 + x[0]`
   - `a[2] = 1000 + \text{sum}(x[:2]) = 1000 + x[0] + x[1]`
   - `a[3] = 1000 + \text{sum}(x[:3]) = 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`
   - And so on, up to `a[n-1] = 1000 + \text{sum}(x[:n-1]) = 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]`.

3. **Printing `a`:**
   - The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
The output will be a sequence of integers where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is 1000 plus the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of the list `x`.

Output: **1000 1000 + x[0] 1000 + x[0] + x[1] 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2] ... 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]**
