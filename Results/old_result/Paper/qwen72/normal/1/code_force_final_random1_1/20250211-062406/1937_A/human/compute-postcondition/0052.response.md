Output State: **`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is log2(n_cases), `power` is equal to `n`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `power` is less than `n`.
- Each iteration of the loop increments `power` by 1.
- The loop will stop when `power` is no longer less than `n`, which means `power` will be equal to `n` when the loop finishes.
- The values of `i` and `n_cases` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
- The value of `n` remains `log2(n_cases)` throughout the loop, as it is not altered within the loop body.
