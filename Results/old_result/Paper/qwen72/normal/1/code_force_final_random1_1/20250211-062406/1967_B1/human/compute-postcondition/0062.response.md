To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation of `ans` step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than or equal to 5.
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `count` is `m + 1`.
- `ans` is computed as follows:
  \[
  ans = n + \left(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor\right) + 1 + \left(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{3}{4} \right\rfloor\right) + 1 + \left(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{5} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{4}{5} \right\rfloor\right) + 1 + \ldots + \left(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{m} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{m-1}{m} \right\rfloor\right) + 1
  \]
- `countmins` is `m - 1`.
- `g` is `int(n / m) - (m - 1)`.
- If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Compute `ans`**:
   - Start with `n`.
   - For each divisor from 2 to `m`, compute the term:
     \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{k-1}{k} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - Add these terms to `n`.

2. **Simplify the Terms**:
   - For any integer `k`, \(\left\lfloor \frac{k-1}{k} \right\rfloor\) is always 0 because \(\frac{k-1}{k}\) is less than 1.
   - Therefore, each term simplifies to:
     \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]

3. **Sum the Terms**:
   - The formula for `ans` becomes:
     \[
     ans = n + \sum_{k=2}^{m} \left( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor + 1 \right)
     \]

4. **Evaluate `g`**:
   - `g` is `int(n / m) - (m - 1)`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins` (which is `m - 1`), the loop breaks. However, since `g` is already defined as `int(n / m) - (m - 1)`, it will be non-negative if `n` is sufficiently large.

5. **Final Computation**:
   - Compute the sum of the terms and add them to `n`.
   - Convert `ans` to an integer (though it should already be an integer).

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n = 10` and `m = 5`:
- `ans = 10 + \left\lfloor \frac{10}{2} \right\rfloor + 1 + \left\lfloor \frac{10}{3} \right\rfloor + 1 + \left\lfloor \frac{10}{4} \right\rfloor + 1 + \left\lfloor \frac{10}{5} \right\rfloor + 1`
- `ans = 10 + 5 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1`
- `ans = 10 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1`
- `ans = 26`

### Final Output:
The `print(int(ans))` statement will print the integer value of `ans`.

Output: **26 (where 26 is the computed value of `ans` based on the given formula and initial state)**
