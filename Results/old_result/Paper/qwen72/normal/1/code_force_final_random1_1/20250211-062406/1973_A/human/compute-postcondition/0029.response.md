Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `total_points` is equal to the sum of the elements of the next tuple (p1 + p2 + p3), `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list containing the value `egalites // 2`. If `total_matchs` > 3 or `p3` > `total_matchs`, and if `total_points` is odd, `resultats` is a list containing `-1` and the loop moves to the next iteration.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value of `egalites // 2` to the list `resultats`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged. If the conditions for appending `-1` to `resultats` are met, the list `resultats` will contain `-1` and the loop will move to the next iteration. However, since the specific conditions for appending `-1` are not mentioned in the code snippet, the primary effect is the addition of `egalites // 2` to `resultats`.
