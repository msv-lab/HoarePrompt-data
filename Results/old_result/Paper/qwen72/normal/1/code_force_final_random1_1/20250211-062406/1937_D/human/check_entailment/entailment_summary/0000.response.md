Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of simulating the movement of a pinball on a one-dimensional grid based on the direction indicated by the characters in the string `s`. The program processes multiple test cases, each with a different grid configuration, and for each test case, it calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid when placed at each cell.

The core logic of the program is implemented in the `func_1` function, which performs the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: It initializes two lists, `A` and `B`, to store cumulative values related to the positions of '>' and '<' characters, respectively. It also initializes two index lists, `idx_A` and `idx_B`, to keep track of the positions of these characters.

2. **Forward Pass**: It iterates through the string from left to right, updating the `A` list and `idx_A` list whenever it encounters a '>' character. This step calculates the cumulative effect of '>' characters on the pinball's movement.

3. **Backward Pass**: It iterates through the string from right to left, updating the `B` list and `idx_B` list whenever it encounters a '<' character. This step calculates the cumulative effect of '<' characters on the pinball's movement.

4. **Calculation and Output**: For each cell in the grid, it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the precomputed values in `A` and `B`. The calculation involves considering the positions and counts of '>' and '<' characters and their impact on the pinball's movement.

The program's logic is complex but appears to correctly implement the required simulation. The execution summary indicates that the function prints the correct output for each test case, and the string `s` remains unchanged, which is expected since the problem only requires printing the results.

Given the complexity of the problem and the detailed steps taken by the program to ensure correctness, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
