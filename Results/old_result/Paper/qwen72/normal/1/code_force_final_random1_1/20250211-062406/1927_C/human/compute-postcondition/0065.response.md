Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 2 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, and `i` is present in both lists `a` and `b`. Additionally, the number of ones in list `a` (`aOnes`) is less than the number of ones in list `b` (`bOnes`).**
