The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function should operate with two positive integers, `n` and `m`, where both `n` and `m` are within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. The output of the function is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact return value without additional context. However, given the typical structure of such functions, it is likely that the function performs some operation using `n` and `m` and returns a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function implicitly operates with two positive integers, `n` and `m`, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The specific return value is not provided, but it is expected to return a result based on the operations performed using `n` and `m`.**
