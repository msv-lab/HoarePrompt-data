Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input split by spaces, `len(b)` is greater than or equal to 1, `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `a` has at least `len(b) + (len(a) - 1)` elements.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
    print(int(m), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input split by spaces, `len(b)` is greater than or equal to 1, `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `a` has at least `len(b) + (len(a) - 1)` elements, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `m` is updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index in `a` where `ql` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the value at index `s` in `a` is equal to `ql`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input split by spaces, `len(b)` is greater than or equal to 1, `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `a` has at least `len(b) + (len(a) - 1)` elements, `q` is greater than 1, `l` is 1, `m` is updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index in `a` where `ql` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 1, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input split by spaces, `len(b)` is greater than or equal to 1, `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `a` has at least `len(b) + (len(a) - 1)` elements, `q` is greater than 1, `l` is 2, `m` is updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`, `ql` is the integer value of the user input minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index in `a` where the original `ql` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`. If `a[s]` is equal to the original `ql`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, but no variables are modified.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
