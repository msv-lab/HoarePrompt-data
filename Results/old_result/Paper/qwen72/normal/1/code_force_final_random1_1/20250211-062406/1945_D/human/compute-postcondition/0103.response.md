Output State: **`pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is 0, `best` is 10 ** 12, `v` is 0, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` is decreased by 1, and `pos_final` are updated with the values from `input().split()`**.

Explanation:
- The variable `best` is set to \(10^{12}\), which is a very large number.
- All other variables (`pos_final`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `total`, `v`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`) retain their previous values or updates as specified in the initial state.
