Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `tmp` is a list containing the single element `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, and `ans` is now `x + y - 2 + (a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to its current value.
- Since `i` is 2, the expression `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` is evaluated and added to `ans`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
