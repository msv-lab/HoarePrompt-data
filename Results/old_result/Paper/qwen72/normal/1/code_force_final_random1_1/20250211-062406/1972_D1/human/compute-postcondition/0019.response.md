Postcondition: ***`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `rank` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `da` is an integer key present in `d`, the length of the list `d[da]` is greater than 1, and `di` is the next integer in the list `d[da]`. If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, `tmp` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`.***
