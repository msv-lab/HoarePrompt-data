Output State: **After all iterations, `i` will have reached `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` for each pair of `x` and `n` processed. The variable `ans` will hold the maximum value among all divisors `i` (from 1 to `int(sqrt(x))`) that satisfy the conditions: `x % i == 0`, `x - n * i >= 0`, `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0`, `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, and `x // i > 0`. If no such divisor exists, `ans` will remain 1. The values of `x`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged for each iteration, but `q` will have incremented from 0 to `t-1`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the inner loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
- During each iteration of the inner loop, the program checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` and if certain conditions involving `n` and `i` are met.
- If these conditions are met, `ans` is updated to the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` that satisfies the conditions.
- After all iterations of the inner loop, `i` will have reached `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
- The final value of `ans` for each test case is printed.
- The values of `x` and `n` are reset for each new test case, and `t` remains unchanged throughout the entire process.
- The loop index `q` increments from 0 to `t-1` as the loop processes each test case.
