Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 2, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, `b` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is updated to be the value of `B[r]`.
- All other variables (`j`, `i`, `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, `r`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
