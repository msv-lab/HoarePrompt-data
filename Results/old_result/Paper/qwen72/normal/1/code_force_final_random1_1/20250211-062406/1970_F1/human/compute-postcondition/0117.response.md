Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input with a length of 3, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` is equal to ".Q", `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. If `el` is equal to ".S", `team` is set to 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is set to 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `el` is neither ".Q" nor ".S", the state remains unchanged.***
