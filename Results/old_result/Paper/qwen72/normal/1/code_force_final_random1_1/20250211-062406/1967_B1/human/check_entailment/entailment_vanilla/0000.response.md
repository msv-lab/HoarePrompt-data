### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), we need to analyze the relationship between \(a\) and \(b\).
   - If \(b = 1\), then \(a + 1\) must be a multiple of \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\), which is always true. Therefore, all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid.
   - For \(b > 1\), we need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The given program initializes `ans` with `n`, which accounts for all pairs \((a, 1)\).
   - It then iterates over possible values of \(b\) starting from 2 up to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values using the formula:
     - `countmins = count - 1`
     - `g = n // count`
     - If `g < countmins`, it breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it updates `ans` with `g // count + 1`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the base case where \(b = 1\).
   - For \(b > 1\), the logic seems to be attempting to count valid \(a\) values, but the specific formula used is not clearly derived from the problem statement.
   - The condition `if g < countmins` and the update `ans += g // count + 1` are not straightforward and may not correctly count all valid pairs.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The logic for counting valid pairs when \(b > 1\) is not clear and may not be correct.
   - The formula `g // count + 1` does not directly correspond to the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The specific formula used for counting valid pairs when \(b > 1\) is not derived from the problem statement and may lead to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
