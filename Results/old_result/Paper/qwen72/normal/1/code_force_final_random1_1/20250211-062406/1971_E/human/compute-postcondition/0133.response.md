To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the formula used to compute `m`.

### Initial State:
- `l` is 2.
- `q` is greater than 2.
- `m` is computed as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `s`**:
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`.
   - Since `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`, the value of `s` will depend on the current value of `ql` and the elements in `a`.

2. **Compute `m`**:
   - `m = b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`
   - To compute `m`, we need the values of `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `a[s - 1]`, and `ad[s]`.

3. **Update `ql`**:
   - `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.

4. **Print `int(m)`**:
   - The `print` statement will print the integer part of `m`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume some example values for the lists `a`, `b`, `ad`, and `bd` to illustrate the calculation:

- `a = [1, 3, 5, 7]`
- `b = [10, 20, 30, 40]`
- `ad = [2, 4, 6, 8]`
- `bd = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `ql = 6` (initially)

1. **Determine `s`**:
   - `s` is the index where `6` would fit in `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, which is `3`.

2. **Compute `m`**:
   - `m = b[2] + bd[3] * (6 - a[2]) / ad[3]`
   - `m = 30 + 4 * (6 - 5) / 8`
   - `m = 30 + 4 * 1 / 8`
   - `m = 30 + 0.5`
   - `m = 30.5`

3. **Update `ql`**:
   - `ql = 6 - 5`
   - `ql = 1`

4. **Print `int(m)`**:
   - `int(m) = int(30.5) = 30`

### Final Output:
Output: **30**
