Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**

Explanation: The variable `winner` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1(a, b)`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `results` remain unchanged. The specific value of `winner` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, but it is now stored in the variable `winner`.
