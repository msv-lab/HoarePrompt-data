To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations performed:

### Initial State:
- `m` is updated to `m + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers provided by user input, with `q` being greater than 0.
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user, and it must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations plus 1.
- `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user from the second input.
- `ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
- `bd` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b` for all elements in `b` except the last one.
- `i` is 1.
- `len(b)` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed.
- `v` is a list containing 0 followed by the values `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., up to `ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]`.
- `l` is 0.
- `ql` is now `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`. If `a[s]` is equal to the original `ql`, the loop continues to the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization and User Input:**
   - `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers provided by the user.
   - `a` and `b` are lists of integers provided by the user, with `a` starting with 0 and `b` starting with 0.
   - `ad` and `bd` are lists of differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - `v` is a list of ratios `ad[i] / bd[i]`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over the elements of `a` and `b`.
   - `s` is determined as the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`.
   - `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
   - `m` is updated to `m + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer value of `m`.

### Final Output:
Given the complexity of the initial state and the operations, the exact value of `m` depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `ql` provided by the user. However, the print statement will output the integer value of `m` after the loop has completed its iterations.

Output: **int(m) (where m is the value of m after the loop has completed its iterations)**
