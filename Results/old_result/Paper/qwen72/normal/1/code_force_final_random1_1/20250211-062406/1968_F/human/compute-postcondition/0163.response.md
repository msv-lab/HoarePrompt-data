Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - (n + 2) * q - 1]` and must be at least 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - (n + 2) * q - 2]`, `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2) + n + 1`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is `int(data[idx - (n + 2) * q - n + i - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is the cumulative XOR of elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to the unique values in `pf` and their respective indices as values, `results` contains the final results of the loop's operations ('YES' or 'NO' for each iteration), with the last element being an empty string, `i` is `n`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index in `v2` just before the position where `r` would be inserted to maintain sorted order. The `results` list will contain 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `n` is determined by the data array and must be at least 0.
- The variable `q` is determined by the data array and must be greater than 0.
- The variable `idx` is updated by adding `q * (n + 2) + n + 1` after each iteration.
- The list `a` is constructed from the data array based on the current values of `n` and `idx`.
- The list `pf` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a`.
- The dictionary `mp` maps each unique value in `pf` to a list of indices where that value occurs.
- The list `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration, depending on whether the conditions inside the loop are met.
- The variables `l` and `r` are updated with new values from the data array at the start of each iteration.
- The variable `x` is the result of the XOR operation between `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`.
- The lists `v1` and `v2` are obtained from the dictionary `mp` using the values `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`, respectively.
- The variables `it1` and `it2` are the indices where `l` and `r` would be inserted into `v1` and `v2` to maintain sorted order.
- The `results` list will contain 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop.
