Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the count of '1' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` is a list of indices, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` that have the minimum absolute difference with `pk`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, the length of `final` is 1, and `c1` is less than 50.** 

Explanation:
- The code `final.append(n)` adds the value of `n` to the list `final`.
- Initially, `final` was an empty list, so after appending `n`, the length of `final` becomes 1.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
