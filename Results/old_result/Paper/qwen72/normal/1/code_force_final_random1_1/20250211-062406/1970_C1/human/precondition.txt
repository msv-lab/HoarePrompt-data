n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, representing the number of nodes in the tree. The tree is represented by n-1 edges, where each edge connects two nodes u and v, with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. The tree has exactly two leaves. The starting node for the game is given by an integer u_1, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.
