### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The total points must be even for a valid set of games.
- The maximum number of draws can be calculated by ensuring that the points are distributed in a way that maximizes the number of draws.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Total Points Check:**
   - The program checks if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are even. If not, it returns `-1`.
   - This check is correct because the total points must be even for a valid set of games.

2. **Total Matches Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `total_matchs` as `total_points // 2`.
   - This calculation is correct because each match (whether a win/loss or a draw) contributes 2 points to the total.

3. **Invalid Cases:**
   - The program checks if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or if `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`. If either condition is true, it returns `-1`.
   - This check is incorrect. The number of matches can be greater than 3, and `p3` can be greater than `total_matchs` in certain valid scenarios. For example, if the scores are `(0, 2, 4)`, the total points are 6, and the total matches are 3, but `p3` is 4, which is valid.

4. **Draws Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `egalites` as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula is incorrect. The correct formula to maximize the number of draws should consider the distribution of points in a way that maximizes the number of draws.

#### Correct Formula:
To correctly calculate the maximum number of draws, we need to ensure that the points are distributed such that the number of draws is maximized. The correct approach involves:
- Ensuring the total points are even.
- Calculating the number of wins and losses.
- Maximizing the number of draws by distributing the remaining points.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        max_wins = (p3 - p1) + (p2 - p1)
        if max_wins > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        draws = total_matchs - max_wins
        resultats.append(draws)
    return resultats
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program uses a flawed formula to calculate the number of draws, leading to incorrect results in some cases. The provided counterexample and the explanation of the correct approach support the original assessment.

Final: **False**
