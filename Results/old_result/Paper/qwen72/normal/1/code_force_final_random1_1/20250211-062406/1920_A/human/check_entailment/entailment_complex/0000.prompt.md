Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

# Annotated Functions:
import math
import re

n = func_1()
ans = []
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
for i in range(n):
    ans.append(func_7())
for i in ans:
    print(i)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: isOne is a boolean value.
def func_1(isOne):
    if (not isOne) :
        return int(input())
        #The program returns an integer value entered by the user.
    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is `True`, it returns the integer value 1. If `isOne` is `False`, it prompts the user to enter an integer and returns the entered integer value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: space is a boolean indicating whether to split the input line by spaces, to_int is a boolean indicating whether to convert the split items to integers.
def func_2(space, to_int):
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: *`space` is a boolean indicating whether to split the input line by spaces, `to_int` is a boolean indicating whether to convert the split items to integers, `line` is the input string provided by the user. If `space` is `True`, `items` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `line` by spaces. If `space` is `False`, `items` is a list of characters from `line`.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers converted from the items in `items`. If `space` is `True`, `items` contains strings obtained by splitting `line` by spaces. If `space` is `False`, `items` contains individual characters from `line`. Since `to_int` is `True`, each item in `items` is converted to an integer before being returned.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns `items`, which is a list of characters from `line` if `space` is `False`. If `space` is `True`, `items` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `line` by spaces. Since `to_int` is `False`, no conversion to integers is performed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes two boolean parameters, `space` and `to_int`. It reads a line of input from the user. If `space` is `True`, the line is split into a list of strings based on spaces. If `space` is `False`, the line is treated as a sequence of characters, resulting in a list of characters. If `to_int` is `True`, each item in the list is converted to an integer. The function returns a list of integers if `to_int` is `True`, or a list of strings/characters if `to_int` is `False`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements that can be converted to strings, and sym is a string.
def func_3(arr, sym):
    string = ''
    for i in arr:
        string += str(i) + sym
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of elements that can be converted to strings, `sym` is a string, `string` is now equal to the concatenation of each element in `arr` converted to a string followed by `sym`, except for the last element which is not followed by `sym`.
    return string
    #The program returns a string that is the concatenation of each element in `arr` converted to a string, followed by `sym`, except for the last element which is not followed by `sym`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes two parameters: `arr`, a list of elements that can be converted to strings, and `sym`, a string. It returns a single string that is the result of concatenating each element in `arr` (converted to a string) followed by `sym`, except that `sym` is not appended after the last element in `arr`. After the function concludes, the input parameters `arr` and `sym` remain unchanged, and the returned string reflects the described concatenation.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string is a string, and substring is a non-empty string.
def func_4(string, substring):
    indices = []
    index = string.find(substring)
    while index != -1:
        indices.append(index)
        
        index = string.find(substring, index + 1)
        
    #State: `string` is a string that contains `substring`. `substring` is a non-empty string. `indices` is a list containing all the indices of every occurrence of `substring` in `string`. `index` is `-1`, indicating that there are no more occurrences of `substring` in `string` after the last found index.
    return indices
    #The program returns a list `indices` containing all the indices of every occurrence of `substring` in `string`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two parameters: `string` (a string) and `substring` (a non-empty string). It returns a list of integers representing the starting indices of every occurrence of `substring` within `string`. If `substring` does not occur in `string`, the function returns an empty list. After the function concludes, the input parameters remain unchanged, and the returned list contains all the indices where `substring` starts in `string`.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and element is an integer.
def func_5(arr, element):
    return [index for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
    #The program returns a list of indices where the value in the list `arr` matches the integer `element`. Each index in the returned list corresponds to a position in `arr` where the value is equal to `element`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `element`. It returns a list of indices where the value in `arr` matches `element`. Each index in the returned list corresponds to a position in `arr` where the value is equal to `element`. If no matches are found, an empty list is returned.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists where each sublist contains at least `index + 1` elements, index is a non-negative integer, and value is an integer.
def func_6(arr, index, value):
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of lists where each sublist contains at least `index + 1` elements, `index` is a non-negative integer, `value` is an integer, and the loop has iterated through all sublists in `arr`. For each sublist `subArray` in `arr`, the element at position `index` in `subArray` is not equal to `value`. The loop did not return any sublist because no sublist in `arr` had an element at position `index` that was equal to `value`.
    return None
    #The program returns None, indicating that no sublist in `arr` had an element at position `index` that was equal to `value`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` takes a list of lists `arr`, a non-negative integer `index`, and an integer `value`. It searches through each sublist in `arr` to find the first sublist where the element at position `index` is equal to `value`. If such a sublist is found, it is returned. If no sublist meets this condition, the function returns `None`. After the function concludes, `arr`, `index`, and `value` remain unchanged, and the function either returns a matching sublist or `None`.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. start and end are floating-point numbers initialized to -1 and 1000000000.0 respectively. num is an empty list.
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = 1000000000.0
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `n` is the total number of iterations performed, `i` is `n-1`, `start` is the maximum value encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value encountered when `t` is 2, and `num` is a list containing all values encountered when `t` is 3. The initial values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged if no updates were made during the loop.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: After all iterations, `n` is the total number of elements in `num`, `i` is the last element in `num`, `start` remains the maximum value encountered when `t` is 1, `end` remains the minimum value encountered when `t` is 2, `num` contains all values encountered when `t` is 3, and `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive).
    if (start > end) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0.
    #State: After all iterations, `n` is the total number of elements in `num`, `i` is the last element in `num`, `start` remains the maximum value encountered when `t` is 1, `end` remains the minimum value encountered when `t` is 2, `num` contains all values encountered when `t` is 3, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive), and `start` is less than or equal to `end`.
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
    #The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus `count_num` if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `start` is the maximum value encountered when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value encountered when `t` is 2, and `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` reads an integer `n` from the user, indicating the number of operations to perform. It then processes `n` lines of input, each containing two integers `t` and `v`. Based on the value of `t`, the function updates the `start` and `end` values or appends `v` to the list `num`. After processing all inputs, the function calculates the number of elements in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive). If `start` is greater than `end`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the count of elements in `num` that fall within the range, ensuring the result is non-negative.
