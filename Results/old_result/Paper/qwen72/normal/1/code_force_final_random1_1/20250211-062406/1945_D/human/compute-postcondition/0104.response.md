To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `v`, `na_frente`, and the range parameters. The loop iterates from `na_frente` down to 0 (inclusive) in steps of -1. For the loop to execute at least once, `na_frente` must be at least 0.

Given the initial state:
- `pos_final` is decreased by 1
- `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `total` is 0
- `best` is 10

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `na_frente` must be at least 0, and `v` should start at `na_frente`.

State: **`pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is 0, `best` is 10, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `v` is `na_frente`**
