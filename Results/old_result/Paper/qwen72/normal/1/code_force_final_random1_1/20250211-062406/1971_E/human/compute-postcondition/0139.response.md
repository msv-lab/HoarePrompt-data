Output State: **`l` is `q - 1`, `q` is greater than or equal to `q`, `m` is the final calculated value, `i` is 1, `ql` is the final adjusted value, `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`, if `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the element at index `s` in the list `a` is equal to `ql`, and the loop has not completed all iterations specified by `t`. `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces. `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers from the input split by spaces. `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers from the input split by spaces.**
