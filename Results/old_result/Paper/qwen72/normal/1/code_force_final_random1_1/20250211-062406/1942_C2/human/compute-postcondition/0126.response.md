The given code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding the current value of `y` to it. Here’s the step-by-step impact of the code:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
   - `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5).
   - `y` is an input integer.
   - `tt` is greater than 2.
   - `ii` is 2.
   - `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
   - `tmp` is a list of integers.
   - `ans` is the final computed value based on the loop's operations.

2. **Code Impact**:
   - The line `ans += y` adds the current value of `y` to `ans`.

3. **Updated Values**:
   - `ans` is now `ans + y`.

4. **Unchanged Variables**:
   - `t`, `n`, `x`, `tt`, `ii`, `i`, `a`, `tmp` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `tmp` is a list of integers, and `ans` is `ans + y`.**
