Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and the function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving a grid of colors, but the function definition provided is incomplete.
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    gr = []
    for i in range(n):
        gr.append(input())
    ans = 'YES'
    if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
        impossible = True
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                impossible = False
        if impossible:
            ans = 'NO'
        impossible = True
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                impossible = False
        if impossible:
            ans = 'NO'
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 1, `m` is the input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`. If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is 'NO'. Additionally, if `impossible` is `True`, then for all `i` from 0 to `n-2`, `gr[i][0] == gr[i + 1][0]` and `gr[i][m - 1] == gr[i + 1][m - 1]`. If `impossible` is `False`, then `ans` remains 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1), `m` is the new input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`. If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, then `ans` is 'NO' if `impossible` is `True`, or 'YES' if any pair of adjacent characters in the first string or the last string of `gr` are different, or if any pair of adjacent strings in `gr` have different first or last characters. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES' and `impossible` remains `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input (greater than 1), `m` is the second integer from the input (greater than 1), `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is a user's input), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, and `ans` is 'YES'. If the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, and if `impossible` is `True`, then `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, if any of the conditions `gr[k][0] != gr[k + 1][0]` or `gr[k][m - 1] != gr[k + 1][m - 1]` were true for any `k` in the range from 0 to `n-2`, then `impossible` is `False` and `ans` remains 'YES'. If none of these conditions are met, `impossible` remains `True` and `ans` remains 'YES'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
