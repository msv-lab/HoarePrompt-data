Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element `res[j]` is `mex - ar[j]` for each `j` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `[n - ar[j] for j in range(len(ar))]`, and `i` is `-1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the list `ar` in reverse order.
- For each element `ar[i]` in the list, the value `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]`.
- The variable `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.
- After the loop completes, `res` contains the computed values for each index, and `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `[n - ar[j] for j in range(len(ar))]`.
- The loop counter `i` ends up being `-1` after the loop completes all iterations.
