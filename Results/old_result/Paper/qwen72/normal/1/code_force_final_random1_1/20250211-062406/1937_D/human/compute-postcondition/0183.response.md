Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 2, `a` is `A[-1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is updated to `a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- Since `l` is 0, `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` simplifies to `0` because any number multiplied by 0 is 0.
- Therefore, `a` is updated to `A[-1] + 0`, which is simply `A[-1]`.
- All other variables (`j`, `i`, `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, `r`, and `b`) remain unchanged.
