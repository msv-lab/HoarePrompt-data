The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the list `set_`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `set_`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `set_`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 3 elements, including 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 3), and `set_` must still have at least 3 elements.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is at least 1 and does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `A` is False; `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 3 elements, including 1; `i` is 3; `not_c` remains True if `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] <= 1`**.
