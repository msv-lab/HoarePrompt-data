Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than `m`, `m` is the length of the list `b`, `k` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers read from the input, `b` remains a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative, `cnt_b[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 1, otherwise `ans` remains 0. Additionally, the current value of `a[0]` is in `b_values`.**
