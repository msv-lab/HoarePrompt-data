Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `results` is a list containing all the values, each of which is the result of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains at least 1 (as it was initially), and the list `results` contains all the values that were generated by calling `func_1(a, b)` during each iteration of the loop. Each value in the `results` list corresponds to one iteration of the loop, and the loop prints each of these values in sequence. The length of the `results` list will be equal to the number of iterations the loop performed.
