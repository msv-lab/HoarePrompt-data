Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is a new input string. If `res` is `<`, then `k` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is set to the value of `i`.
- Since `i` is 3, `k` is now 3.
- The conditions for `n` and `res` remain unchanged.
- If `res` is `<`, then `k` is 3 (as per the updated value).
