You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of s is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    i, j = 0, len(unique_chars) - 1
    for char in s:
        if char in unique_chars:
            s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
            j -= 1
        else:
            unique_chars.insert(i, char)
            i += 1
            j += 1
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `s` will consist of the last unique character in the original `unique_chars` list repeated for the length of the original `s`. The `unique_chars` list will contain all unique characters from the original `s`, including any characters that were not initially in `unique_chars` but were added during the loop execution, and it will be in the order they were processed. The indices `i` and `j` will be such that `i` is equal to the number of unique characters that were not originally in `unique_chars` and were added during the loop, and `j` will be `len(unique_chars) - 1` minus the number of unique characters that were replaced in `s`.
    return ''.join(unique_chars)
    #The program returns a string consisting of all unique characters from the original `s`, including any characters that were not initially in `unique_chars` but were added during the loop, in the order they were processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `s` and returns a new string containing all unique characters from `s` in the order they were first encountered.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string consisting of all unique characters from the original `s`, including any characters that were not initially in `unique_chars` but were added during the loop, in the order they were processed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
