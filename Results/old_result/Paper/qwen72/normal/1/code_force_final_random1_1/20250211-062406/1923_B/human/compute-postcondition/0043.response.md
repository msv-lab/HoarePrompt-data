Output State: **`delta` is the minimum of the original `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`, `rest` is now `k - 2 * delta - delta` and must be greater than 0, `pos` is the number of monsters that have been defeated and must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`, `distance` is now `distance + 1`, and the values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged except for the modifications to `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` as applicable.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rest` is updated by subtracting `delta` from its current value, which was initially `k - 2 * delta`.
- The new value of `rest` is `k - 2 * delta - delta`, which simplifies to `k - 3 * delta`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
