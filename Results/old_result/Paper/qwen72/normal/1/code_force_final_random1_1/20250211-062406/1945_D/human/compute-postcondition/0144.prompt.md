Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; b is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `cases` is an integer input by the user.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(cases):
    na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
    custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    na_frente -= 1
    pos_final -= 1
    total = 0
    best = 10 ** 12
    for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
        if v <= pos_final:
            if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    print(best)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged. The variable `v` will be `-1` (since the loop decrements `v` starting from `na_frente` until it reaches `-1`). The variable `total` will be the sum of the minimum costs (`min(custo_pra_trocar_a[v], custo_pra_passar_b[v])`) for each `v` from `na_frente` down to `0` (inclusive). The variable `best` will be the minimum value between the initial `best` and the updated `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each `v` where `v <= pos_final`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `pos_final` is decreased by the number of iterations, `total` is the cumulative sum of the smaller costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each iteration, and `best` is the minimum value between the initial `best` and the sum of `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each iteration where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. The variable `v` is 0, and `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `pos_final` will be decreased by 1, `custo_pra_passar_b` and `custo_pra_trocar_a` will remain as lists of integers obtained from the input, `total` will be the sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0, and `best` will be the minimum value between the initial `best` (10) and the sum of `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` where `v <= pos_final`. The variable `v` will be -1, indicating the loop has completed its iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
