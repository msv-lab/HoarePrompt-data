Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `pos_final` is decreased by the number of iterations, `total` is the cumulative sum of the smaller costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each iteration, and `best` is the minimum value between the initial `best` and the sum of `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each iteration where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. The variable `v` is 0, and `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.**
