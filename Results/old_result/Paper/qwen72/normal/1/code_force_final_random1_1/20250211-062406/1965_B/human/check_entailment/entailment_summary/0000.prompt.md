Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

    func_15()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single integer from standard input and returns this integer. After the function concludes, the program has read one integer from the standard input and the returned value is the integer that was read.

 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line from standard input, splits the line by spaces, converts each element into an integer, and returns an iterator of these integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters.

Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `rows_number`, which is a positive integer, and returns a list containing the results of calling `func_3()` repeated `rows_number` times. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that a new list has been created, containing the output of `func_3()` for each iteration up to `rows_number`.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  Reads a line from standard input and returns it after stripping any trailing whitespace. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the returned value is a byte string representing the input line without trailing whitespace.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  Reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace, decodes the line from bytes to a string, and returns the resulting string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  Reads a line of input from the user, expecting it to be a sequence of space-separated integers, and returns a list of these integers. The function does not take any parameters and modifies no external state. After the function concludes, the program has a list of integers derived from the user input.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a parameter `rows`, which is a non-negative integer. It returns a list containing the results of calling `func_7()` `rows` times. Each element in the list is the result of one call to `func_7()`. If `rows` is 0, the function returns an empty list.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters and returns the user input as a string. After the function concludes, the program has returned a string containing the input provided by the user.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer input by the user. After the function concludes, the program has returned an integer value provided by the user.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, and returns this list. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the user's input has been processed and returned as a list of strings.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` takes four parameters: a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of integers, an integer `da` which is a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers. The function updates the `processing` and `rank` lists and returns an integer. If the list `d[da]` contains only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed yet (as indicated by `processing[di - 1]` being 0), and sets `rank[da - 1]` to one more than the minimum value returned by these recursive calls. The function ultimately returns this updated value of `rank[da - 1]`.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, where `b` is not zero. It returns a tuple of three elements. If `b` is zero, it returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively computes and returns a tuple where the first element is the second element from a recursive call to `func_13(b, a % b)`, the second element is the result of `x - a // b * y` (where `x` and `y` are the first and second elements from the recursive call), and the third element is the third element from the recursive call. The function effectively computes values related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, though the specific relationship is not explicitly stated.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14():
    (n, k) = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if k == 1:
        if n == 2:
            return '1\n2'
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    else:
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    return ' '.join(map(str, ans))
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` takes no explicit parameters but internally calls `func_7` to obtain two integers `n` and `k` such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. It then processes these values to generate a specific output. If `k == 1` and `n == 2`, the function returns the string '1\n2'. For other values of `n` and `k` where `k == 1`, it constructs a list `ans` containing powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(l-1)`, where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. If `k != 1`, it constructs a list `ans` starting with powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`, followed by `k - 2^(lk-1)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then continues with `2^i` for each `i` from `lk` to `l-1`, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`. Finally, the function returns a space-separated string of the elements in the list `ans`.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It iterates a number of times determined by the return value of `func_10()`, and during each iteration, it prints the result of `func_14()` to the console. After the function completes, the console will contain the output of `func_14()` for each iteration, and the program state will remain unchanged except for the side effect of the console output.
