Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, and `word` is a string. If `n` > 52, `word` is the string formed by appending the character at index `n - 53` of `alphabet` followed by `'zz'`. If `n` is between 27 and 52 (inclusive), `word` is set to `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. If `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), `word` is set to `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.***
