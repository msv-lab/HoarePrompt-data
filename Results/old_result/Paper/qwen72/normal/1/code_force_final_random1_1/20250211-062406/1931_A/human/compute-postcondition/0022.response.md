To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `word` is an empty string initially.

2. **Conditions for setting `word`:**
   - If `n` > 52, `word` is set to the string containing the character from `alphabet[n - 53]` followed by `'zz'`.
   - If `n` is between 27 and 52 (inclusive), `word` is set to `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
   - If `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), `word` is set to `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

3. **Explanation of the conditions:**
   - `alphabet` is assumed to be a list of characters from 'a' to 'z'.
   - For `n` > 52, `word` is set to a character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 53` followed by `'zz'`.
   - For `n` between 27 and 52, `word` is set to `'a'` followed by a character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 28` followed by `'z'`.
   - For `n` between 3 and 26, `word` is set to `'aa'` followed by a character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 3`.

4. **Determine the value of `word` based on the value of `n`:**
   - If `n` > 52, `word` will be a string with a character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 53` followed by `'zz'`.
   - If `n` is between 27 and 52, `word` will be a string starting with `'a'`, followed by a character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 28`, and ending with `'z'`.
   - If `n` is between 3 and 26, `word` will be a string starting with `'aa'`, followed by a character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 3`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we need to consider the possible values of `word` based on the conditions.

Output: **word (where word is determined by the value of n as follows: if n > 52, word is the character from alphabet[n - 53] followed by 'zz'; if 27 <= n <= 52, word is 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'; if 3 <= n <= 26, word is 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3])**
