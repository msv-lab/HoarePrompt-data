To determine what will be printed by the `print(word)` statement, we need to evaluate the value of `word` based on the initial state and the conditions provided.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0 (though this is not used in the calculation of `word`).
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 78 (inclusive).
- `word` is determined based on the value of `n` as follows:
  - If `n` is between 53 and 78 (inclusive), `word` is the character from the alphabet corresponding to the position `n - 53` followed by 'zz'.
  - If `n` is between 27 and 52 (inclusive), `word` is 'a' + the character at position `n - 28` in the alphabet + 'z'.
  - If `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), `word` is 'aa' followed by the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Determine the range of `n`:**
   - Since `n` is between 3 and 78, we need to check which of the three conditions it falls into.

2. **Evaluate the conditions:**
   - If `n` is between 53 and 78:
     - Calculate the position in the alphabet: `position = n - 53`.
     - Convert the position to the corresponding character: `chr(97 + position)`.
     - Construct `word` as: `chr(97 + position) + 'zz'`.
   - If `n` is between 27 and 52:
     - Calculate the position in the alphabet: `position = n - 28`.
     - Convert the position to the corresponding character: `chr(97 + position)`.
     - Construct `word` as: `'a' + chr(97 + position) + 'z'`.
   - If `n` is between 3 and 26:
     - Calculate the position in the alphabet: `position = n - 3`.
     - Convert the position to the corresponding character: `chr(97 + position)`.
     - Construct `word` as: `'aa' + chr(97 + position)`.

### Example Calculation:

Let's assume `n` is 60 (as an example within the range 53 to 78):
- `position = 60 - 53 = 7`.
- The character at position 7 in the alphabet is `h` (since `a` is 0, `b` is 1, ..., `h` is 7).
- Therefore, `word` is `hzz`.

### General Output:

Since `n` can be any integer between 3 and 78, the output will depend on the specific value of `n`. However, we can describe the output based on the conditions:

- If `n` is between 53 and 78, `word` will be a string consisting of a single character from the alphabet (corresponding to `n - 53`) followed by 'zz'.
- If `n` is between 27 and 52, `word` will be a string starting with 'a', followed by a character from the alphabet (corresponding to `n - 28`), and ending with 'z'.
- If `n` is between 3 and 26, `word` will be a string starting with 'aa', followed by a character from the alphabet (corresponding to `n - 3`).

### Final Output:
Output: **word (where word is determined based on the value of n as described above)**
