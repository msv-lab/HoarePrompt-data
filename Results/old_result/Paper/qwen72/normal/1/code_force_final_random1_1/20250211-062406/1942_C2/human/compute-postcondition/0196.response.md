Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in `even`, `odd` is a non-empty list of gaps that are greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order, `even` is a list of gaps that are greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element. `ans` is increased by `2 * y` plus the value of `gap`. `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.**
