Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers read from input and satisfy the conditions 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both `n` and `m` are odd. `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`. `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' and the value (-1, -1), and the key `line[ind]` and the value (0, 2). If `line[1]` is not equal to '..', `elements` also has the key `line[1]` and the value (0, 1), and the key `line[0]` and the value (0, 0). If `isPlayer(line[1])` is true, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key `line[1]` and the value `False`. If `isPlayer(line[1])` is false, `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary. `goal` is a list containing two lists: the first is always empty, and the second contains the tuple (0, 0) if the second character of the string at `line[1]` is 'G', otherwise both lists remain empty. `points` is a list `[0, 0]`. `i` is 0. `line` must contain at least two strings. `ind` is 2. `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the string at `line[ind]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple (0, 2).** 

Explanation: The code appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Since `i` is 0 and `ind` is 2, the tuple `(0, 2)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`. The value of `tmp` depends on the first character of the string at `line[ind]`. If the first character is 'B', `tmp` is 0, otherwise `tmp` is 1. Therefore, `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple `(0, 2)`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
