Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than or equal to 5, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `int(n / 3)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `int(n / 3)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
