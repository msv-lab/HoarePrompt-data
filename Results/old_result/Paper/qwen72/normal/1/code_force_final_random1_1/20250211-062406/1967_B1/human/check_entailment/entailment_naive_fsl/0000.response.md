Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
1
2 2
```
According to the problem, the valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2). Therefore, the expected output should be 3.

However, the program outputs 4, which is incorrect. This discrepancy arises because the logic in the program does not correctly account for all valid pairs in this case. Specifically, the loop and the way `ans` is incremented do not accurately reflect the conditions specified in the problem statement.
