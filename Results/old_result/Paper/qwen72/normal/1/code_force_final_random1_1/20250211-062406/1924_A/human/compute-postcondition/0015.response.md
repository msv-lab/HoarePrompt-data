The code snippet `ans += ss` appends the value of `ss` to the string `ans`. Since `ans` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `ans` will be equal to the value of `ss`. However, `ss` is not defined in the initial state, but `cur_ss` is defined as the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus 97. Assuming `ss` should be `cur_ss` (since `ss` is not defined), the value of `ans` will be the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `cur_ss` + 97.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5
- `i` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `s` is an input string that must contain at least one character
- `cnt` is 1
- `ans` is an empty string
- `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus 97
- `cur` is 0

After executing the code snippet:
- `ans` is now the first character of `s`
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must contain at least one character, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the first character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus 97, `cur` is 0.**
