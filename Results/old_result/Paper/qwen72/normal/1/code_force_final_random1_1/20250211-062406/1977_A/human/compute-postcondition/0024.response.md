The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 1), and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, and `m` is the second integer from the input. If `n` == `m`, then `n` is equal to `m`. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `m`, and the following conditions hold: if `m` > `n`, then `m` is greater than `n`; if `m` <= `n`, then `m` is less than or equal to `n`; if `m` == `n - 1`, then `m` is exactly one less than `n`; if both `m` and `n` are even, then both `m` and `n` are even numbers; if both `m` and `n` are odd, then `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0` holds true.**
