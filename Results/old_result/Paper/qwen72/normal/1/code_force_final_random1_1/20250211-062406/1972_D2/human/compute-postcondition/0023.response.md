Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the user, `x` is 3, `y` is 1, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`, and `n` must be at least 12 and `m` must be at least 4. Additionally, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.**
