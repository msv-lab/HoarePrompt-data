Output State: **`pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_passar_b` and `custo_pra_trocar_a` are lists of integers obtained from the input, `total` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `v` is `na_frente`, `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, and if `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` before the update, then `best` is now `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**
