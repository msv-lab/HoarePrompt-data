Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`.
- The length of `lis` is odd.
- All consecutive elements in `lis` have a difference of at most 1.
- `test` is True.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, it will always print the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
