The code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the list `a` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the value at `a[1]` is incremented by 1. However, the initial value of `a[1]` is not specified, so we can only say that it is incremented by 1.

The other variables (`n`, `x`, `j`) remain unchanged. The character at index 0 of `x` is still 'F'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string with the character at index 0 being 'F', `j` is 1, and `a[1]` is incremented by 1.**
