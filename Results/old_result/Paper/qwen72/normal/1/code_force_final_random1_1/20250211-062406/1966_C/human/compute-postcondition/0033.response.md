Output State: **`dp` is `True`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `tc` is `tc - 1` and `tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is `int(input())`, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0`, based on the new input.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets `dp` to `True`.
- The initial state specifies that `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `tc` is `tc - 1` and `tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is `int(input())`, and `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0`, based on the new input.
- Since the code only changes the value of `dp` to `True`, all other conditions and values remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `dp` while maintaining the other conditions and values from the initial state.
