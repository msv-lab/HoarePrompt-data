The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given the initial state, `ans` starts at 0, so after executing the code, `ans` will be 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `m-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 1, `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
