To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `a` is the same as before.
- `b` is now `b + c`.
- `c` is the same as before.
- `s` is the second line of the input (though it is not used in the print statement).

### Print Statement:
```python
print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a`: This variable remains unchanged from its previous value.
   - `b`: This variable is updated to `b + c`.
   - `c`: This variable remains unchanged from its previous value.
   - `s`: This variable is mentioned but not used in the print statement.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `b % 3`: This calculates the remainder when `b` is divided by 3.
   - `c < b % 3`: This is a boolean expression that evaluates to `True` if `c` is less than the remainder of `b` divided by 3, and `False` otherwise.
   - `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`: This is a tuple with two elements: `a - -b // 3` and `-1`. The expression `c < b % 3` determines which element of the tuple is selected. If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the second element `-1` is selected. If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the first element `a - -b // 3` is selected.

3. **Calculating the Values:**
   - `b % 3`: Since `b` is now `b + c`, the remainder when `b + c` is divided by 3 is `b % 3 + c % 3` (considering the properties of modular arithmetic).
   - `c < b % 3`: This depends on the specific values of `c` and `b % 3`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the output will be `-1`.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the output will be `a - -b // 3`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume some example values to illustrate:
- Suppose `a = 10`, `b = 7`, and `c = 2`.
- After updating, `b` becomes `7 + 2 = 9`.
- `b % 3` is `9 % 3 = 0`.
- `c < b % 3` is `2 < 0`, which is `False`.
- Therefore, the expression `a - -b // 3` is evaluated:
  - `-b` is `-9`.
  - `-b // 3` is `-9 // 3 = -3`.
  - `a - -b // 3` is `10 - (-3) = 10 + 3 = 13`.

So, the output will be `13`.

### General Case:
Without specific values, the output depends on the relationship between `c` and `b % 3`.

Output: **(a - -b // 3) if c >= b % 3 else -1 (where a, b, and c are as described in the initial state)**
