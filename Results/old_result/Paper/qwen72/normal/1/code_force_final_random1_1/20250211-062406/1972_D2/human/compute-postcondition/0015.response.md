To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is at least 3
   - `m` is at least 6
   - `x` remains unchanged
   - `y` is incremented by 1
   - `cnt` remains unchanged

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `y` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `y` is `y + 1`.
   - The expression `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is evaluated:
     - `n / ((x + y) * x)` calculates the division of `n` by the product of `(x + y)` and `x`.
     - `m // ((x + y) * y)` calculates the integer division of `m` by the product of `(x + y)` and `y`.
   - The minimum of these two values is added to `cnt`.

4. **Calculations:**
   - Let's denote the new value of `y` as `y_new = y + 1`.
   - The first term: `n / ((x + y_new) * x) = n / ((x + (y + 1)) * x) = n / ((x + y + 1) * x)`
   - The second term: `m // ((x + y_new) * y_new) = m // ((x + (y + 1)) * (y + 1)) = m // ((x + y + 1) * (y + 1))`
   - The minimum of these two terms is added to `cnt`.

5. **Output State:**
   - `n` is at least 3
   - `m` is at least 6
   - `x` remains unchanged
   - `y` is now `y + 1`
   - `cnt` is updated to `cnt + min(n / ((x + y + 1) * x), m // ((x + y + 1) * (y + 1)))`

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 6, `x` remains unchanged, `y` is now `y + 1`, `cnt` is updated to `cnt + min(n / ((x + y + 1) * x), m // ((x + y + 1) * (y + 1)))`.**
