Output State: **All elements in `b_values` have been processed, and for each element `i` in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0 except for `cnt_b[b[0]]` which is now 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is now 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is now 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt_b[b[2]]` by 1.
- Initially, `cnt_b[b[2]]` was 0.
- After executing the code, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is now 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
