Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `p` is `[0]`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least one element, `c` is `[0]`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `x` is the first element of `l`. If `x` is 1, then `j` is 1.***
