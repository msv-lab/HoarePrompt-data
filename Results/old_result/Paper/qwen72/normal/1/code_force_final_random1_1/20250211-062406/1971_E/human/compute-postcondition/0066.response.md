To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `m` step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`i` is 1**: This is a simple integer.
2. **`m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`**: This is the key expression we need to evaluate.
3. **`t` is greater than 0**: This is a condition, but it doesn't directly affect the calculation of `m`.
4. **`n`, `k`, and `q` are integers provided by the user input, with `q` being greater than 0**: These are user inputs, but they don't directly affect the calculation of `m`.
5. **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations plus 1**: This is a list where the first element is 0, and the rest are user-provided integers.
6. **`b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user from the second input**: This is another list where the first element is 0, and the rest are user-provided integers.
7. **`ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`**: This list contains the differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
8. **`bd` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b` for all elements in `b` except the last one**: This list contains the differences between consecutive elements of `b` except the last one.
9. **`v` is a list containing 0 followed by the values `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., up to `ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]`**: This list contains the ratios of the differences from `ad` and `bd`.
10. **`l` is 2**: This is a simple integer.
11. **`ql` is now `ql - a[s - 1]`**: This updates `ql` based on the value of `a[s - 1]`.
12. **`s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`**: This determines the index `s` based on the original value of `ql`.

### Calculation of `m`:
- **`b[s - 1]`**: This is the element in the list `b` at index `s - 1`.
- **`bd[s]`**: This is the element in the list `bd` at index `s`.
- **`ql - a[s - 1]`**: This is the updated value of `ql` after subtracting `a[s - 1]`.
- **`ad[s]`**: This is the element in the list `ad` at index `s`.

The formula for `m` is:
\[ m = b[s - 1] + bd[s] \times \frac{(ql - a[s - 1])}{ad[s]} \]

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the following values for simplicity:
- `a = [0, 1, 3, 5]`
- `b = [0, 2, 4, 6]`
- `ql = 4`
- `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than 4, which is 2 (since `a[2] = 3`).

Now, let's calculate the values:
- `a[s - 1] = a[1] = 1`
- `ql - a[s - 1] = 4 - 1 = 3`
- `b[s - 1] = b[1] = 2`
- `bd[s] = b[2] - b[1] = 4 - 2 = 2`
- `ad[s] = a[2] - a[1] = 3 - 1 = 2`

Substitute these values into the formula for `m`:
\[ m = 2 + 2 \times \frac{3}{2} = 2 + 3 = 5 \]

### Final Output:
The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer value of `m`, which is 5.

Output: **5**
