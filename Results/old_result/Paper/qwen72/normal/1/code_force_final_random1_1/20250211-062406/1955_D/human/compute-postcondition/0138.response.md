The value of `curr` is decremented by 1. The values of `i`, `m`, `n`, `b_values`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The conditions related to `cnt_b` and `a` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2. If `curr` was greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 1 or 2, and the conditions related to `cnt_b` and `a` remain unchanged. If `curr` was less than `k`, `ans` remains 0, and the conditions related to `cnt_b` and `a` remain unchanged. The count of `a[1]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1. `curr` is now `curr - 1`.**
