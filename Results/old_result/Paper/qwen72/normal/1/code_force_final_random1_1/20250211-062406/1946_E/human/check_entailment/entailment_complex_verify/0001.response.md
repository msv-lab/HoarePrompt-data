### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the number of permutations of length `n` that match the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums, with the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. It is particularly useful for finding modular inverses.
   - **func_2(a, b)**: This function computes the modular inverse of `b` under modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and then multiplies it by `a`. This is essential for performing division in modular arithmetic, which is necessary for combinatorial calculations.

3. **Algorithm for Permutations**:
   - The main algorithm in the provided code calculates the number of valid permutations by considering the constraints imposed by the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The key steps include:
     - Precomputing factorials modulo \(10^9 + 7\) for efficient combinatorial calculations.
     - Checking if the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum are the same, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is `n`. If these conditions are not met, the number of valid permutations is 0.
     - Using combinatorial methods to count the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements while respecting the given prefix and suffix maximums.
     - Multiplying the results of these combinatorial calculations and taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Function Mismatch**:
   - The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are indeed used correctly in the context of the problem. They are essential for performing the necessary combinatorial calculations and ensuring that the results are modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions and the main algorithm correctly solve the problem as described. The combinatorial calculations and modular arithmetic are implemented appropriately to count the number of valid permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
