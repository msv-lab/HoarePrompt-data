Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq l \leq r < \text{len}(a)\), `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of elements in `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive, and `s` is greater than \((r - l + 1) \times (r - l + 1)\), `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called.***
