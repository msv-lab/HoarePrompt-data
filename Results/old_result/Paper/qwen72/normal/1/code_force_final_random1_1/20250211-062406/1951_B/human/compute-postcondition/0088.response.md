Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are assigned the integer values from the input, `s` is a list of integers from the input with at least 3 elements, the first element of `s` (s[0]) and the `k-1`th element of `s` (s[k-1]) have been swapped, `h` is the value of the first element of `s` (s[0]), `j` is 2, `i` is `s[3]`. If `h < i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans` remains 2. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 3.**
