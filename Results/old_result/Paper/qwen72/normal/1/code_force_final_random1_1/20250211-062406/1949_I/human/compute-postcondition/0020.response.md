Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n` except `coef[n-1]` which is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`, and the value of `visited[i]` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `bipartite = True` does not change the value of `bipartite` because it was already `True` in the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged.
