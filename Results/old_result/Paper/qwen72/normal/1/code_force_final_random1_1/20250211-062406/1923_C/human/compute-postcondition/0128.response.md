The code `c.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `c`.

- Initially, `c` is `[0, j, j]`.
- After appending `j`, `c` becomes `[0, j, j, j]`.

The value of `j` is 1 if the first element of `l` is 1, otherwise `j` is 0. If `x` (the third element of `l`) is 1, `j` is increased by 1.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `i` is the sum of the first and second elements of `l` plus the third element of `l`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `p` is `[0, i, i, i]`, `l` is a list of integers from user input with at least three elements, `c` is `[0, j, j, j]`, `j` is 1 if the first element of `l` is 1, otherwise `j` is 0, and `x` is the third element of `l`. If `x` is 1, `j` is increased by 1.**
