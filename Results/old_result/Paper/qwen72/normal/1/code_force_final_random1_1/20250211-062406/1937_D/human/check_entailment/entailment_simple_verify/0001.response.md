### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a one-dimensional grid with characters `<` and `>`.
   - A pinball moves left or right based on the character and inverts the character after moving.
   - The goal is to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting cell.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It calls the function `func_1(s)` to compute the results.
   - The results are printed for each test case.

3. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - Two lists `A` and `B` are initialized to store cumulative values.
     - Two lists `idx_A` and `idx_B` are initialized to store indices of `>` and `<` respectively.
   - **Forward Pass**:
     - For each cell `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `s[i]` is `>`, it calculates the cumulative value and appends it to `A` and `idx_A`.
   - **Backward Pass**:
     - For each cell `i` from `n-1` to 0, if `s[i]` is `<`, it calculates the cumulative value and appends it to `B` and `idx_B`.
   - **Result Calculation**:
     - For each cell `i` from 0 to `n-1`, it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the cumulative values in `A` and `B`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the forward and backward passes to precompute the necessary values.
   - The result calculation for each cell is based on the precomputed values, which should accurately reflect the movement of the pinball.
   - The logic for handling different cases (when `l < r`, `r == 0`, etc.) seems to cover all possible scenarios.
   - The program should handle edge cases where the grid is entirely `<` or `>`.
   - It should also handle cases where the grid is a mix of `<` and `>`.

5. **Performance**:
   - The program uses linear time complexity for both the forward and backward passes, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Forward Pass**:
  - The loop iterates over the string `s` from left to right.
  - For each `>`, it calculates the cumulative value and appends it to `A` and the index to `idx_A`.
  - This ensures that `A` and `idx_A` contain the necessary information for cells with `>`.

- **Backward Pass**:
  - The loop iterates over the string `s` from right to left.
  - For each `<`, it calculates the cumulative value and appends it to `B` and the index to `idx_B`.
  - This ensures that `B` and `idx_B` contain the necessary information for cells with `<`.

- **Result Calculation**:
  - The program iterates over each cell `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
  - Depending on whether the cell contains `>` or `<`, it uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
  - The logic for handling different cases (when `l < r`, `r == 0`, etc.) is comprehensive and covers all possible scenarios.

### Edge Cases:
- **All `<`**: The program should correctly handle this case by using the precomputed values in `B` to calculate the time for each cell.
- **All `>`**: The program should correctly handle this case by using the precomputed values in `A` to calculate the time for each cell.
- **Mixed `<` and `>`**: The program should correctly handle this case by using both `A` and `B` to calculate the time for each cell.

### Final Evaluation:
After a detailed analysis of the program's structure, logic, and handling of edge cases, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The precomputation and result calculation steps are well-structured and should handle all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
