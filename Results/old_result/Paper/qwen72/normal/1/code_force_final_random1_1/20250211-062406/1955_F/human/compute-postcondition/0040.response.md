Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `x` is the last element of `a`, if the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, then `cnt` is 1 + sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a), otherwise `cnt` is sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a).**

### Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `p_i` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The list `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `x` is updated to the last element of `a` after the loop completes.
- The variable `cnt` is incremented by `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in the list `a`. If the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, `cnt` starts with an initial value of 1; otherwise, it starts at 0. After the loop completes, `cnt` will be the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements in `a`, plus 1 if the initial condition was met.
