Output State: **`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is set to the log2 of the input integer, `power` is 1. If `power` is not equal to `n`, `power` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- `i` remains 1.
- `n_cases` remains greater than 1.
- `n` is updated to the log2 of the input integer.
- `power` is initially set to 1.
- If `power` (which is 1) is not equal to `n` (the log2 of the input integer), `power` is decremented by 1.
