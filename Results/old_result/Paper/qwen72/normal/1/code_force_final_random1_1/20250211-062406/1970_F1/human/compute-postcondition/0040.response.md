Output State: **`n` and `m` remain integers read from input and satisfy the conditions 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both `n` and `m` are odd. `grid` is now a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the updated `line`. `elements` is a dictionary that contains entries for each unique non-'..' string in `line`, with the key being the string and the value being a tuple (0, index) where index is the position of the string in `line`. `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains entries for each player string (as determined by the `isPlayer` function) found in `line`, with the key being the player string and the value being `False`. `goal` is a list containing two lists: the first list contains tuples (0, index) for each string in `line` that ends with 'G' and starts with 'B', and the second list contains tuples (0, index) for each string in `line` that ends with 'G' and starts with 'R'. `points` remains a list `[0, 0]`. `i` is 0. `line` is updated to a list of strings read from the input, and its length is the same as the number of iterations the loop executed.**
