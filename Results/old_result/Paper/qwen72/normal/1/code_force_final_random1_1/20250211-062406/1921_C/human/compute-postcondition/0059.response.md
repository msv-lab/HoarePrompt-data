Output State: **`array2` is no longer empty and contains the value `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than `n`, `i` is 1, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the new input, and the difference between the second element of `arr` and the first element of `arr` is less than `b` divided by `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a` to `array2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
