You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an even integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of columns in the grid. The grid consists of two rows, and each row is represented by a string of length n containing only the characters '<' and '>', indicating the direction of the arrows in each cell. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is the last integer input by the user, `a` is the last string input by the user, `b` is the last string input by the user, and `i` is the last odd number less than `n`. The loop has completed all iterations for all `t` test cases. For each test case, if the loop did not break due to the condition `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program will print 'yes'. If the loop broke due to the condition being met, the program printed 'No' and moved on to the next test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. It checks if it's possible to move from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a 2-row grid, where each cell contains an arrow pointing left ('<') or right ('>'). The function prints 'No' if it finds any conflicting arrows that prevent such a path, and 'Yes' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the printed results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a grid with 2 rows and `n` columns.
   - Each cell contains an arrow pointing either left (`<`) or right (`>`).
   - The robot starts at cell `(1, 1)` and must reach cell `(2, n)`.
   - The robot makes two moves per second: one move in a direction (left, right, up, or down), followed by a move in the direction of the arrow in the current cell.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The robot can only move within the grid.
   - The robot must reach the last column of the second row `(2, n)`.
   - The robot's movement is influenced by the arrows in the cells.

3. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n`, the first row `a`, and the second row `b`.
   - It then iterates through the grid in steps of 2, checking specific conditions:
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both `<` or if `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both `<`, it prints 'No' and breaks the loop.
   - If none of these conditions are met, it prints 'yes'.

4. **Evaluating the Conditions:**
   - The condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` checks if the robot can get stuck in a loop where it keeps moving left in both rows.
   - The condition `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` checks if the robot can get stuck in a similar loop but involving the previous column.
   - If either of these conditions is true, the robot cannot reach `(2, n)`.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program uses `print('No')` and `print('yes')` which should be consistent with the problem statement (e.g., `YES` and `NO`).
   - The program does not handle the case where the robot can reach `(2, n)` without getting stuck in a loop.

6. **Correctness:**
   - The logic of the program is flawed because it does not correctly check all possible paths the robot can take.
   - The conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` and `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` are not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach `(2, n)`.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not fully capture the conditions required to determine if the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.

Correctness: **False**
