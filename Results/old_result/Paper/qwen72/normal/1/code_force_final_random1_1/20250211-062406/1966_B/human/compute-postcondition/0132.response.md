Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input (greater than 1), `m` is the second integer from the input (greater than 1), `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is a user's input), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, and `ans` is 'YES'. If the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, and if `impossible` is `True`, then `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, if any of the conditions `gr[k][0] != gr[k + 1][0]` or `gr[k][m - 1] != gr[k + 1][m - 1]` were true for any `k` in the range from 0 to `n-2`, then `impossible` is `False` and `ans` remains 'YES'. If none of these conditions are met, `impossible` remains `True` and `ans` remains 'YES'.***
