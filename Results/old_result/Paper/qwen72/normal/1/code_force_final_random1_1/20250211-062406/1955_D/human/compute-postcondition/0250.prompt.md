Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; b is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. max_val is 1000000. cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(m):
        cnt_b[b[i]] += 1
    b_values = set(b)
    ans = 0
    curr = 0
    for i in range(m):
        if a[i] in b_values:
            cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
            if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
                curr += 1
    if curr >= k:
        ans += 1
    for i in range(n - m):
        if a[i] in b_values:
            cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
            if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
                curr -= 1
        if a[i + m] in b_values:
            cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
            if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
                curr += 1
        if curr >= k:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)
    for i in b_values:
        cnt_b[i] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All elements in `b_values` have been processed, and `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for every `i` in `b_values`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All elements in `b_values` have been processed, and for each element `i` in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` will have iterated through all elements in `b_values`, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` is the length of the list `b`, `k` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers read from the input, `b` remains a list of integers read from the input, `curr` is the final number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative, `b_values` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, and `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for every `i` in `b_values`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
