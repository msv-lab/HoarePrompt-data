Output State: **`x` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `n` is updated to the value provided by the input, `q` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`, `t` remains unchanged, `ans` is updated to the maximum value between the original `ans` and `x // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `ans` to the maximum value between its current value and `x // i`.
- Since `i` is 2, `x // i` simplifies to `x // 2`.
- The values of `x`, `i`, `n`, `q`, and `t` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `ans` is the maximum of its original value and `x // 2`.
