Output State: **`l` is equal to `q - 1`, `m` is the final calculated value, `ql` is the final adjusted value, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`, `t` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have at least `len(b)` elements, `ad` is `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]]`, `bd` is `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]]`, `i` is 3, `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ad[3] / bd[3], ad[3] / bd[3]]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `ad[3] / bd[3]` to the list `v`. Since `i` is 3, the new element added to `v` is the same as the last element already present in `v`, which is `ad[3] / bd[3]`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
