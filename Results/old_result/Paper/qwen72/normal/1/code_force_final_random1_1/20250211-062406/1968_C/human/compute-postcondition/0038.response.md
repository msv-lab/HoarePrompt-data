To determine what will be printed by the `print(*a)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the list `a` step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\).
   - `x` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `a` is a list of length `n`.
   - `a[0]` is initialized to 1000.
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is calculated as \(1000 + \text{sum}(x[:i])\).
   - `i` is set to `n-1`.

2. **Construction of List `a`:**
   - The first element `a[0]` is 1000.
   - For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where \(1 \leq i < n\)), the value is calculated as \(1000 + \text{sum}(x[:i])\).

3. **Understanding the Print Statement:**
   - The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

4. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `n = 4` and `x = [1, 2, 3]`.
   - `a[0] = 1000`.
   - `a[1] = 1000 + sum(x[:1]) = 1000 + 1 = 1001`.
   - `a[2] = 1000 + sum(x[:2]) = 1000 + (1 + 2) = 1003`.
   - `a[3] = 1000 + sum(x[:3]) = 1000 + (1 + 2 + 3) = 1006`.
   - Therefore, `a = [1000, 1001, 1003, 1006]`.

5. **General Case:**
   - The first element of `a` is always 1000.
   - Each subsequent element `a[i]` is 1000 plus the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `x`.

Given this understanding, the output of the `print(*a)` statement will be the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Output: **1000 1000 + sum(x[:1]) 1000 + sum(x[:2]) ... 1000 + sum(x[:n-1])** (where each element is calculated as described above)
