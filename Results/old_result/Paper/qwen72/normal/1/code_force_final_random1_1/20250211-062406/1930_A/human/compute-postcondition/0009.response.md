The code snippet `score += l[i]` updates the value of `score` by adding the value of the element at index `i` in the list `l` to the current value of `score`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1
- `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input
- `score` is now equal to the sum of the first and third elements of `l`
- `i` is 4
- `2 * n` must be greater than 4

The value of `i` is 4, so the element at index 4 in the list `l` is added to `score`. The new value of `score` is the sum of the first, third, and fifth elements of `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `score` is now equal to the sum of the first, third, and fifth elements of `l`, `i` is 4, `2 * n` must be greater than 4.**
