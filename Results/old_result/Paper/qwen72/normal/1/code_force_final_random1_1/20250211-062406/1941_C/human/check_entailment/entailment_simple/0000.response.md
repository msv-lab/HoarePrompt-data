Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string `s` and then outputs the sum of these counts. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not account for overlapping occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie". Additionally, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

For example, consider the string "mmapnapie":
- The program counts "map" once and "pie" once, resulting in a total of 2 deletions.
- However, to make the string beautiful, we can delete the 4th and 9th characters ('m' and 'e'), which results in the string "mapnap", which is still ugly because it contains "map".

A correct approach would involve identifying the positions of the substrings "map" and "pie" and calculating the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of these substrings, considering overlaps.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
