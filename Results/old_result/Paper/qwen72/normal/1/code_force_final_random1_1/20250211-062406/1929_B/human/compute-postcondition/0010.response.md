To determine what will be printed by the `print(k // 2 + 1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input.
   - If \(4 \times n - 2 = k\), then the current values of `n` and `k` satisfy the equation.
   - Otherwise, \(4 \times n - 2\) is not equal to `k`.

2. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `k // 2 + 1`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The value of `k` is determined by the user input.
   - The expression `k // 2` performs integer division of `k` by 2.
   - Adding 1 to the result of `k // 2` gives the final value to be printed.

4. **Possible Values of `k`:**
   - If \(4 \times n - 2 = k\), then `k` is an even number because \(4 \times n - 2\) is always even (since 4 times any integer is even, and subtracting 2 from an even number results in another even number).
   - For any even number `k`, `k // 2` will be an integer, and adding 1 to it will give the final result.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `k` is an even number (as derived from the equation \(4 \times n - 2 = k\)), the expression `k // 2` will yield an integer.
   - Therefore, the final output will be the integer value of `k // 2 + 1`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **(k // 2) + 1 (where k is an even number such that \(4 \times n - 2 = k\))**
