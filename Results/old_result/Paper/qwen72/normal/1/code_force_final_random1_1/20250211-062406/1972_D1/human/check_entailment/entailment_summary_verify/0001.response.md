Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not solve the problem as described. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Core Logic Function (`func_15`)**:
   - The function `func_15` reads \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7()`.
   - It then enters a loop that iterates while \(i \times i \le n + i\).
   - Inside the loop, it updates `ans` with the expression \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Analysis of `func_15`**:
   - The loop condition `while i * i <= n + i` does not align with the problem's requirements. It is not clear why this condition is chosen.
   - The calculation `ans += (n + i) // (i * i)` does not reflect the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The final `return ans - 1` is arbitrary and does not correspond to the problem's solution.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This involves calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and checking the condition for each pair.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
