Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum cost when the number of yogurts `A` is odd is flawed. The program incorrectly calculates the cost for the last yogurt when `A` is odd by adding the price of a single yogurt (`B`) to the total cost after purchasing pairs of yogurts at the promotion price. This approach may not always yield the minimum cost.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
3 5 8
```
- Here, `n = 3`, `a = 5`, and `b = 8`.
- The program will calculate the cost as follows:
  - `X = A // 2 = 1`
  - Total cost = `X * C + B = 1 * 8 + 5 = 13`
- However, the correct minimum cost should be `10` (buying two yogurts at the promotion price for `8` burles and one yogurt at the regular price for `2` burles).

Thus, the program does not always produce the correct minimum cost, making it incorrect.
