The code updates the value of `mini` to the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the third element in `lst`. Since `ele` is defined as the third element in `lst`, the expression `abs(pk - ele)` calculates the absolute difference between `pk` and the third element in `lst`. This value is then compared with the current value of `mini`, and `mini` is updated to the smaller of the two.

Output State: **`lst` must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in `lst`, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the third element in `lst`.**
