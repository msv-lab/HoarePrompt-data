Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is equal to `t` and greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
- `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1.
- `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1.
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `j` is 1.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input.
- If `y` > `x`, the condition `y` > `x` holds true.
- If `y` ≤ `x`, the condition `y` ≤ `x` holds true.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Defaultdict `d1`**:
   - `d1` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`, meaning any key that is not explicitly set will return 0.
   - `d1[2]` is explicitly set to 1.

2. **Variables `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input.
   - The relationship between `x` and `y` is either `y > x` or `y ≤ x`.

3. **Behavior of `d1`**:
   - If `x` or `y` is 2, `d1[x]` or `d1[y]` will be 1.
   - For any other value of `x` or `y`, `d1[x]` or `d1[y]` will be 0 because they are not explicitly set in `d1`.

4. **Possible Outcomes**:
   - If `x == 2` and `y != 2`, then `d1[y] - d1[x] = 0 - 1 = -1`.
   - If `y == 2` and `x != 2`, then `d1[y] - d1[x] = 1 - 0 = 1`.
   - If both `x` and `y` are 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x] = 1 - 1 = 0`.
   - If neither `x` nor `y` is 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x] = 0 - 0 = 0`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will depend on the values of `x` and `y` provided by the user input. The possible outputs are:
- **-1** if `x == 2` and `y != 2`.
- **1** if `y == 2` and `x != 2`.
- **0** if both `x` and `y` are 2 or neither is 2.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] and d1[x] are the values of d1 at y and x respectively, and d1[2] is 1, all other keys default to 0)**
