Output State: **`v1` is now the list associated with the key `pf[r]` in the dictionary `mp`. `v2` is now the list associated with the key `pf[l - 1]` in the dictionary `mp` (or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`). `it1` is updated to the index of the first element in `v1` that is greater than or equal to `l` using `bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)`. `it2` is updated to `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `x` is equal to 0, `results` now contains the string 'YES'. If `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)`, `results` also contains the string 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` contains the string 'NO'. `results` now contains the string 'NO' appended to its existing content.**
