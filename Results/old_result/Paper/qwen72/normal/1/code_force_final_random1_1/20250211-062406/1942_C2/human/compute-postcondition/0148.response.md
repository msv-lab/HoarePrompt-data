Output State: **`i` is the second element of `val`, `val` is a non-empty list sorted with odd numbers first followed by even numbers, both groups in ascending order, `x` is the final value of `x` (unchanged from its value when the loop started), `c` is `i // 2`, `sx` is now `sx + i`, `y` is `y - c`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `sx += i` adds the value of `i` to `sx`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged, except for the updated value of `sx`. The value of `y` is also reduced by `c` as per the initial state.
