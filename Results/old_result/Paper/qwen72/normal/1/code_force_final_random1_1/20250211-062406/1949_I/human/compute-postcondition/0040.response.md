Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000.
- `x` is a list of `n` integers.
- `y` is a list of `n` integers.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers.
- `visited` is a list where all elements are `True`.
- `coef` is a list where each element is either 1 or another value depending on the DFS traversal.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `tot` is the total count of nodes processed during the DFS traversals (specific value depends on the implementation).
- `bipartite` is `True` or `False` depending on whether the graph is bipartite.
- `ok` is `True` and the graph is bipartite and `tot` is not 0.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will execute because:

- `ok` is `True`.
- The graph is bipartite.
- `tot` is not 0.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **YES**
