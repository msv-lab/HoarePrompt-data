Let's analyze the given code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- If the first character of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is '>', then `idx_A` is `[1]` and `A` is `[x, x + 1]` where `x` is the last element of `A` before the update.
- If the first character of `s` is not '>', then `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged as empty lists.
- If `s[1]` is '>', then `idx_A` is updated to `[1]` and `A` is updated to `[x, x + 1]` if `s[0]` is '>', otherwise `idx_A` is `[0, 1]` and `A` is `[0, 1]`.
- If `s[1]` is not '>', then `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the initial values of `A` and `idx_A` based on `s[0]` and `s[1]`:**
   - If `s[0]` is '>' and `s[1]` is '>':
     - `idx_A` is `[1]`
     - `A` is `[x, x + 1]` where `x` is the last element of `A` before the update.
   - If `s[0]` is '>' and `s[1]` is not '>':
     - `idx_A` is `[1]`
     - `A` is `[x, x + 1]` where `x` is the last element of `A` before the update.
   - If `s[0]` is not '>' and `s[1]` is '>':
     - `idx_A` is `[0, 1]`
     - `A` is `[0, 1]`
   - If `s[0]` is not '>' and `s[1]` is not '>':
     - `idx_A` is `[]`
     - `A` is `[]`

2. **Calculate the new value of `x` based on the current values of `A` and `idx_A`:**
   - **Case 1: `s[0]` is '>' and `s[1]` is '>':**
     - `A` is `[x, x + 1]`
     - `idx_A` is `[1]`
     - `x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`
     - `x = (x + 1) + (2 - 1) * 1`
     - `x = (x + 1) + 1`
     - `x = x + 2`
   - **Case 2: `s[0]` is '>' and `s[1]` is not '>':**
     - `A` is `[x, x + 1]`
     - `idx_A` is `[1]`
     - `x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`
     - `x = (x + 1) + (2 - 1) * 1`
     - `x = (x + 1) + 1`
     - `x = x + 2`
   - **Case 3: `s[0]` is not '>' and `s[1]` is '>':**
     - `A` is `[0, 1]`
     - `idx_A` is `[0, 1]`
     - `x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`
     - `x = 1 + (2 - 1) * 2`
     - `x = 1 + 2`
     - `x = 3`
   - **Case 4: `s[0]` is not '>' and `s[1]` is not '>':**
     - `A` is `[]`
     - `idx_A` is `[]`
     - `x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`
     - This case will raise an error because `A` and `idx_A` are empty lists, and accessing their elements will fail.

### Output State:
- **If `s[0]` is '>' and `s[1]` is '>':**
  - `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 2.

- **If `s[0]` is not '>' and `s[1]` is not '>':**
  - The code will raise an error because `A` and `idx_A` are empty lists.
  - Output State: **Error: `A` and `idx_A` are empty lists, and accessing their elements will fail.**
