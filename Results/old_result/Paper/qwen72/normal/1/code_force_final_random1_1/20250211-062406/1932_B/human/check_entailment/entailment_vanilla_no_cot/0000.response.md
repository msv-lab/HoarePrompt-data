Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It iterates through each test case, calculates the year when the nth sign will occur based on the given periodicities, and prints the result for each test case. The logic inside the loop ensures that the signs occur sequentially as required by the problem statement. The use of `year += year % ai or ai` correctly handles the calculation of the next occurrence year for each sign.
