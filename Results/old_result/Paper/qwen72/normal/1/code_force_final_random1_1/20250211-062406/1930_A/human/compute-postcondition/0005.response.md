The value of `score` is incremented by the value of the first element in the list `l`. The index `i` remains 0, and the other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `score` is now equal to the first element of `l`, `i` is 0**
