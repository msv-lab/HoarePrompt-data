### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and processes each constraint using a loop in `func_7()`.

2. **Constraint Processing:**
   - **Type 1 Constraints (`k >= x`):** The program updates `start` to the maximum value of `x` encountered.
   - **Type 2 Constraints (`k <= x`):** The program updates `end` to the minimum value of `x` encountered.
   - **Type 3 Constraints (`k != x`):** The program appends `x` to the list `num`.

3. **Counting Valid Integers:**
   - The program counts the number of integers in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`.
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, the program returns 0, indicating no valid integers.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers as `end - start + 1 - count_num`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where no valid integers exist (`start > end`).
   - It also correctly handles the case where some specific values are excluded by Type 3 constraints.

### Correctness Evaluation:

- **Input Handling:** The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- **Constraint Processing:** The program correctly updates `start` and `end` based on Type 1 and Type 2 constraints, and it correctly appends values to `num` for Type 3 constraints.
- **Counting Valid Integers:** The program correctly counts the number of valid integers and handles edge cases appropriately.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
