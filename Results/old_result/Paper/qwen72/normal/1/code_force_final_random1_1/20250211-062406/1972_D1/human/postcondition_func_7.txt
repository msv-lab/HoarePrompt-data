The function `func_8` accepts a non-negative integer `rows` and returns a list of length `rows`. Each element in the list is the result of calling the function `func_7()`. The specific values of the elements depend on the implementation of `func_7()`. After the function concludes, the program has a list of length `rows` containing the results of `func_7()`.
