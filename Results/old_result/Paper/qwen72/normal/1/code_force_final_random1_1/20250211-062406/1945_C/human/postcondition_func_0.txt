The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only '0' and '1'. It processes each test case to find the optimal index (or indices) where the percentage of '0's up to that index and the percentage of '1's after that index are both at least 50%. If no such index exists, it checks the overall preference and outputs 0 if the majority preference is '1' or `n` if the majority preference is '0'. The function prints the smallest optimal index for each test case.
