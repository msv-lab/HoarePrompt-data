Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a list containing two items: the first item is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and the second item is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), `test` is the second element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `current_year`, `n` is the first item of `test`, `a` is the second item of `test`, and `current_year` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for ai in a:
    if current_year % ai == 0:
        next_year = current_year + ai
    else:
        next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
    current_year = next_year


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements, `test` is the second element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `current_year`, `n` is the first item of `test`, `a` is the second item of `test` and must contain at least one element, `current_year` is set to `next_year`. If `current_year` was divisible by the first element of `a` (denoted as `ai`), `next_year` was set to `ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` was set to `ai` and `current_year % ai` was not equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements, `test` is the second element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `current_year`, `n` is the first item of `test`, `a` is the second item of `test` and must contain at least three elements. `current_year` is updated to the value of `next_year`. If `current_year % ai == 0`, `next_year` was set to `current_year + ai`, where `ai` is the third element of `a`. Otherwise, `current_year` was set to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, and `next_year` was set to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements, `test` is the second element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing one element which is `current_year`, `n` is the first item of `test`, `a` is the second item of `test` and must contain at least four elements. `ai` is the fourth element of `a`. `current_year` is updated to the value of `next_year`, and `next_year` remains the same as its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
