To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `j` is equal to `n`.
2. `i` is 0.
3. `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order.
4. `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop.
5. `l` is 0.
6. `r` is the length of `B`.
7. `n` is greater than 0.
8. The current character at position `i` in the string `s` is '>'.
9. `l` is not less than `r`.
10. `r` is not equal to 0.
11. `a` is equal to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` if `l - r > 0` or `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` otherwise.
12. `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `r` is the length of `B` and is not equal to 0.
   - `l` is 0 and not less than `r`.
   - The current character at position `i` in the string `s` is '>'.
   - `a` is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` because `l - r` is not greater than 0.
   - `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.

2. **Calculating `a`:**
   - `a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`
   - Since `i` is 0, this simplifies to `a = B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r`.

3. **Calculating `b`:**
   - `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
   - Since `i` is 0 and `l` is 0, `idx_A[l - 1]` is undefined (but we assume it's a valid index for the sake of the problem). Let's denote `idx_A[l - 1]` as `idx_A[-1]` for simplicity.
   - Therefore, `b = b + (0 - idx_A[-1]) * r`.

4. **Final Expression:**
   - The expression to be printed is `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`.
   - Substituting the values:
     - `a = B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r`
     - `b = b + (0 - idx_A[-1]) * r`
     - `n - i = n - 0 = n`
   - Therefore, the expression becomes:
     - `(B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r) * 2 + (b + (0 - idx_A[-1]) * r) * 2 + n`

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the calculations, the output will be:
Output: **(B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r) * 2 + (b + (0 - idx_A[-1]) * r) * 2 + n**
