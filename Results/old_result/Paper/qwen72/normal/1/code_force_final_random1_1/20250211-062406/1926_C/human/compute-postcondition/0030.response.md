Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0, `pd[N]` is the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N` plus `pd[N-1]`, `i` is `N`, `pd[i]` is now the sum of the digits of `N`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each digit `j` in the string representation of `i` (which is `N`).
- For each iteration, the value of `pd[i]` is incremented by the integer value of the current digit `j`.
- After all iterations, `pd[i]` will be the sum of all the digits of `N`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `N`, and `pd[0]`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
