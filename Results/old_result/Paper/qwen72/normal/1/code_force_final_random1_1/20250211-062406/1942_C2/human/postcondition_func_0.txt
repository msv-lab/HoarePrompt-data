The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates a value `ans` based on the differences between the sorted list of integers and the values of `x` and `y`. The function then prints the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, leaving the input variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of integers in their final states as described in the annotations.
