The code snippet `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` updates the value of `total` by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to it. Given the initial state, let's determine the new state:

- `total` was initially 0.
- `v` is equal to `na_frente`.
- `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is a specific integer value from the list `custo_pra_passar_b`.

After executing the code, `total` will be updated to the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers where \(1 \leq m \leq n \leq 200,000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `b` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\), `cases` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is \(10^{12}\), `v` is `na_frente`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
