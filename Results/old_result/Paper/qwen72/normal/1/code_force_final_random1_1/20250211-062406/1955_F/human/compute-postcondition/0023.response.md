Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `cnt` is `cnt + math.floor(a[0] / 2) + math.floor(x / 2)`, `x` is the second element of `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is updated by adding `math.floor(x / 2)` to its current value.
- `x` is the second element of the list `a`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
