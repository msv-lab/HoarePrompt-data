The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case is a tuple containing a tuple `(n, m)` and a string `a` of length `n` with characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case to ensure that there are at least `m` problems of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). It returns a list `results` with `t` elements, where each element represents the number of additional problems required for the corresponding test case. The input parameters `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged after the function execution.
