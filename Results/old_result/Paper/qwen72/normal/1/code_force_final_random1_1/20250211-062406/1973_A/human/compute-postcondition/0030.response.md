Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `total_points` is equal to the sum of the elements of the next tuple (p1 + p2 + p3), `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If `egalites` < 0, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`. Otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing the value `egalites // 2`. If `total_matchs` > 3 or `p3` > `total_matchs`, and if `total_points` is odd, `resultats` is a list containing `-1` and the loop moves to the next iteration.***
