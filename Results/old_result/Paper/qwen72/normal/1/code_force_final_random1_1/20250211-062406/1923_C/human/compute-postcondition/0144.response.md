To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `m` is greater than 0 but less than its previous value.
   - `a` and `b` are updated to new values provided by user input.
   - `i` is equal to `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
   - `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `(b - a + 1)` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, then these conditions hold true.
   - Otherwise, either `(b - a + 1)` is less than or equal to 1, or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will execute if the conditions are met. Since the conditions are explicitly stated to hold true, the `print('YES')` statement will indeed be executed.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
