Output State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is the last digit of `num`.** 

Explanation: The value of `a` is updated to be the sum of its current value (which was 0) and the last digit of `num` (obtained by `num % 10`). Since `a` was initially 0, `a` now holds the last digit of `num`. The value of `num` remains unchanged.
