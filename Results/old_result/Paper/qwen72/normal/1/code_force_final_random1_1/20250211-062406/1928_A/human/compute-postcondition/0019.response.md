To determine what will be printed by the `print('yes')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` and `b` are integer values from the input.
   - If both `a` and `b` are even, then the condition `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0` holds.
   - Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd.
   - If `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is true, then the respective condition holds.
   - Otherwise, neither `(a - b == -a, a)` nor `(b - a == -b, b)` is true, and the difference `(a - b)` is either odd (not divisible by 2) or even (divisible by 2).

2. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('yes')` statement does not depend on any of the conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'yes'`.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Regardless of the values of `a` and `b`, the `print('yes')` statement will always print the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
