The code snippet `num.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `t`, `start`, or `end` directly, but it changes the content of the list `num`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `t` is 3
- `v` is an integer from the input
- If `t` is 2, `start` remains unchanged
- If `end` > `v`, `end` is updated to `v`
- Otherwise, `end` remains unchanged
- If `t` is 1 and `start` < `v`, `start` is updated to `v`
- Otherwise, `start` remains unchanged

After executing the code snippet:
- The list `num` now includes the value `v` as its new last element.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` is 3, `v` is an integer from the input, `start` and `end` remain unchanged, `num` is a list that now includes `v` as its new last element.**
