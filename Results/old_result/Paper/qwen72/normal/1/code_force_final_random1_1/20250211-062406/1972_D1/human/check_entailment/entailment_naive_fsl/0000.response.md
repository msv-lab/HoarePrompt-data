Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. Specifically, the function `func_15` and `func_16` do not implement the logic required to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The logic in `func_15` appears to be unrelated to the problem statement. It calculates a value based on a loop that increments `i` and updates `ans`, but this does not match the required conditions for the pairs (a, b).

A correct implementation would need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. The current implementation does not perform this check and thus is incorrect.
