Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers provided by the user input.
   - `X` is calculated as `A // 2`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(X * C + B)`.

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - `X` is calculated as `A // 2`, which means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.
   - The expression inside the print statement is `X * C + B`.
     - `X * C` multiplies the value of `X` by `C`.
     - The result of `X * C` is then added to `B`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the result of the expression `X * C + B`.
   - Since `X` is `A // 2`, the expression becomes `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Therefore, the output will be the result of the expression `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A, B, and C are integers provided by the user input)**
