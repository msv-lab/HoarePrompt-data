Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value between 100000000 and `abs(n / 2 - ele)`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the count of '1' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` contains at least one more element, `ele` is the next element in `lst`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum of its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The updated value of `mini` is now the minimum value between 100000000 and `abs(n / 2 - ele)`.
