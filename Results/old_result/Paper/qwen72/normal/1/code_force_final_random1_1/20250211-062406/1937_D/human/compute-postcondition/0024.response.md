Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `len(idx_A) == 0`, then `A` is `[0]`, `idx_A` is `[1]` if `s[0]` is '>' and `s[1]` is '>', otherwise `idx_A` is `[0, 1]` if `s[0]` is not '>' and `s[1]` is '>', and `idx_A` remains unchanged as an empty list if `s[1]` is not '>' and `A` remains unchanged as an empty list if `s[0]` and `s[1]` are not '>'. If `len(idx_A) != 0`, then `A` is a list containing one element `x`, and `idx_A` is an empty list.***
