To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i in range(n - 1)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - The loop will continue if `i` is still less than `n - 1`.

### Adjusted State:

- `i` will be incremented from 0 to 1.
- `n` remains the same (greater than 1).

### Final State:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a new input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the new `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in the new `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in the new `sl`, `mini` is `100000000`, `i` is 1, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0, `one` is 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `lst` is a list containing `[1]` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` remains an empty list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` that have the minimum absolute difference with `pk`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n` if the length of `final` is 0, `c1` is greater than or equal to 50 if the length of `final` is 1 and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `c1` is less than 50 if the length of `final` is 1 and `c1` is less than 50, and `t` is decremented by 1.**
