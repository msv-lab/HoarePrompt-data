Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1441, `s` is the new input string provided by the user, which must be a positive integer, and `h` is the first two characters of `s` as a string. If `h` is '00', the value of `h` remains '00'. If `int(h)` is less than or equal to 12, the integer value of `h` is within the range 1 to 12. If `int(h)` is greater than 12, the integer value of `h` is greater than 12.***
