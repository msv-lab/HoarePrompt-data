Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` will be equal to `n`.
   - `i` will be 0.
   - `idx_B` will contain the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order.
   - `B` will contain the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop.
   - If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty lists.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is the length of `B`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The current character at position `i` in the string `s` is '>'.
   - `l` is not less than `r`.
   - The current value of `r` is 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(n - i, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The expression `n - i` simplifies to `n - 0`, which is just `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will print the value of `n` followed by a space.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **n (where n is the value of n)**
