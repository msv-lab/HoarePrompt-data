Postcondition: ***`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 0, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty lists. `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `n` is greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of the string `s` is not '>'. If `l` is 0, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, `a` is updated to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.***
