Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly identify whether the shape is a square or a triangle. Here are the issues:

1. **Shape Identification Logic**: The logic used to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle is flawed. The code checks if the first two counts of '1's in the rows are equal (`if k[0] == k[1]:`). This is insufficient because:
   - For a square, all rows should have the same number of '1's.
   - For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should follow the pattern \(2i - 1\) for a normal triangle or \(2(n-i+1) - 1\) for an upside-down triangle.

2. **Handling Upside-Down Triangles**: The current logic does not account for upside-down triangles, which are valid shapes according to the problem statement.

3. **Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle edge cases well, such as when the shape is not aligned perfectly with the grid edges.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to:
- Check if all rows have the same number of '1's to identify a square.
- Check if the number of '1's in each row follows the pattern \(2i - 1\) or \(2(n-i+1) - 1\) to identify a triangle.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def is_square(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    count_ones = [row.count('1') for row in grid]
    return all(count == count_ones[0] for count in count_ones)

def is_triangle(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    count_ones = [row.count('1') for row in grid]
    
    # Check for normal triangle
    for i in range(n):
        if count_ones[i] != 2 * (i + 1) - 1:
            break
    else:
        return True
    
    # Check for upside-down triangle
    for i in range(n):
        if count_ones[i] != 2 * (n - i) - 1:
            break
    else:
        return True
    
    return False

def func():
    a = int(input())
    for _ in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        if is_square(grid):
            print('SQUARE')
        elif is_triangle(grid):
            print('TRIANGLE')
        else:
            print('INVALID SHAPE')  # This should never happen given the problem constraints

func()
```

This corrected version properly identifies whether the shape is a square or a triangle by checking the specific patterns for each shape.
