Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each element `arr[i]` satisfies 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`).
- The length of `arr` (n) is between 1 and 2 · 10^5.
- `nums` is a `Counter` object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
- The frequency of the integer 0 in `nums` is decreased by 1.
- The frequency of the integer 1 in `nums` is decreased by 2.
- The frequency of the integer 2 in `nums` is decreased by 2.
- `start` is 2.
- `vis` is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 2.
- The frequency of the integer 2 in `nums` must be greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(start + 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `start` is explicitly given as 2.
- The expression `start + 1` will evaluate to `2 + 1`, which is 3.

### Output:
The code will print the result of the expression `start + 1`, which is 3.
Output: **3**
