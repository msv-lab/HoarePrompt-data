Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 0.
- `time` is `t-1`, so `time` is -1.
- `command` is the last list of strings read from standard input during the final iteration.
- `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `mov`, `grid`, and `player` may have changed based on the commands processed during the loop. Specifically:
  - `allPlayers` may have some keys set to `True` if the command was `.Q`.
  - `points` may have been incremented by 10 for the respective team if the command was `.S`.
  - Positions of players and the ball (`.B`) may have been updated based on movement commands.
  - Any eliminations or goals scored will have been printed to the console.

The print statement is:
```python
print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the values of `points[0]` and `points[1]` at the end of the loop. These values represent the scores for two teams, and they may have been updated based on the commands processed during the loop.

Since the exact commands and their effects are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the final values of `points[0]` and `points[1]`.

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where [points[0]] and [points[1]] are the final scores for the two teams after all commands have been processed)**
