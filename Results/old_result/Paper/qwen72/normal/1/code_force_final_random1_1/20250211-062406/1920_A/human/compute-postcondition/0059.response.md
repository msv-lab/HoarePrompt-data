Postcondition: **After all iterations, `n` is the total number of elements in `num`, `i` is the last element in `num`, `start` remains the maximum value encountered when `t` is 1, `end` remains the minimum value encountered when `t` is 2, `num` contains all values encountered when `t` is 3, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are between `start` and `end` (inclusive), and `start` is less than or equal to `end`.**
