Output State: **`v1` is now the list associated with the key `pf[r]` in the dictionary `mp`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged. If `x` is equal to 0, `results` now contains the string 'YES'. If `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)`, `results` also contains the string 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` contains the string 'NO'. `it2` is updated to `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.**
