Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `j` will be equal to `n`, `i` will be `-1`, `idx_B` will contain the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, and `B` will contain the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty lists.**

### Explanation:
- **`j`**: After the loop completes, `j` will have incremented from 0 to `n`, so `j` will be `n`.
- **`i`**: Since `i` is initialized as `n - 1 - j` and `j` increments from 0 to `n`, the final value of `i` will be `n - 1 - n`, which simplifies to `-1`.
- **`idx_B`**: This list will contain the indices of all occurrences of the character '<' in the string `s`, in descending order (from the end of the string to the beginning).
- **`B`**: This list will contain the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. Each value in `B` corresponds to the position of a '<' character in `s`, and the calculation depends on the previous values in `B` and the positions stored in `idx_B`.

If there are no '<' characters in the string `s`, both `idx_B` and `B` will remain empty lists, as no updates will be made to them during the loop.
