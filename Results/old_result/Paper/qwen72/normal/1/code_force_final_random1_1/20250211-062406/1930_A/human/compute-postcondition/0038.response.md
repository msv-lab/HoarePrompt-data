The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the given parameter constraints and relationships, it is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- A list of `2n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, representing the numbers written on the whiteboard.

The function is expected to process each test case and return a result based on the input list of integers.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. It returns a result for each test case based on the provided list of integers.**
