Functionality: ** The function reads a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it determines and prints whether 'Alice' or 'Bob' wins based on the game rules. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the variables used within the function are no longer defined. **
