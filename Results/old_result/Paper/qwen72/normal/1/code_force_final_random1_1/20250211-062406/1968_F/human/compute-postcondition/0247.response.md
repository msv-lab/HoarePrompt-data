The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, each containing the following parameters:
- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer representing the length of the list `a`, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
  - `q`: An integer representing the number of queries, where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers, where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30.
  - Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r`, where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.

The function processes each test case and each query within the test case. For each query, it performs some operation on the sublist `a[l:r]` and returns a result for each query. The exact nature of the operation is not specified, but the function returns a result for each query.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with parameters `t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, and a list of queries. For each query, it processes the sublist `a[l:r]` and returns a result for each query.**
