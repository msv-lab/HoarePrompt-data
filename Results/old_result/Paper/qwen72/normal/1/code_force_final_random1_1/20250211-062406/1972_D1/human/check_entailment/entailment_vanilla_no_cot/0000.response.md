Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_15` and the loop in `func_16` do not implement the logic required to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current implementation in `func_15` seems to be unrelated to the problem statement and does not perform the necessary calculations to find the valid pairs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
