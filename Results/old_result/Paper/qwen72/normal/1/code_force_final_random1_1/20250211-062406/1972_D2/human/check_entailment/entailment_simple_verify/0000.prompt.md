You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: After all iterations, `n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the user, `x` is the smallest integer such that `x * x > n`, `y` is 1, and `cnt` is the total count of valid `(x, y)` pairs where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: The `print(cnt)` statement will print the total count of valid `(x, y)` pairs where `x` is the smallest integer such that `x * x > n`, `y` is 1, and the pairs satisfy the conditions `(x + 1) * x <= n` and `x + 1 <= m`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input format correctly as specified in the problem description. The problem states that the input will contain multiple test cases, and the first line will contain the number of test cases `t`. However, the function `func_1` is called directly without considering the number of test cases. This means that the program will only process the first test case and will not handle the remaining test cases as required.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the input for each test case. The `func_1` function reads the input inside the loop, but it should read the input for each test case within the loop in `func_2`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func_1(n, m):
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    return cnt

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(func_1(n, m))

func_2()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program processes all test cases and reads the input correctly for each test case.
