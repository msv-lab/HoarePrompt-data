The code snippet `ans1 += 1` increments the value of `ans1` by 1. The initial value of `ans1` is 0, so after executing this code, `ans1` becomes 1. All other variables (`s`, `i`, `j`, `ans`, `p`, `z`, and `h`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the last element checked in `s` (or `s[-1]` if the loop completes without breaking), `j` is the index of the last element checked in `s` (or `len(s) - 2` if the loop completes without breaking), `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` and meet the condition `h >= i` before encountering an element greater than `h`, `p` is equal to `j`, `ans1` is 1, `z` is 1, and `i` is not equal to `h`. Additionally, `i` is less than or equal to `h`.**
