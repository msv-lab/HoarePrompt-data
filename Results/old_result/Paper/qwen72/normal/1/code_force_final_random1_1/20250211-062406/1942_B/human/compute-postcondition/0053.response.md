Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `ar[len(ar) - 2]` is greater than 0, `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]`. If `mex` (which is initially `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]`) is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - 2 * ar[len(ar) - 2]` and `res[i]` is set to `n - 2 * ar[len(ar) - 2]`. Otherwise, the values of `mex` and `res[i]` remain unchanged.***
