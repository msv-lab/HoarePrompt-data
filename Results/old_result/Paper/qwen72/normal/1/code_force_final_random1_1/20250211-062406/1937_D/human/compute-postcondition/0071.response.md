Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `j` will be equal to `n`.
2. `i` will be 0.
3. `idx_B` will contain the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order.
4. `B` will contain the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty lists.
5. `l` is 0.
6. `r` is the length of `B`.
7. `n` must be greater than 0.
8. The current character at position `i` in the string `s` is '>'.
9. `a` is now equal to the first element of `A` (i.e., `A[0]`).
10. `b` is now equal to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `a`**:
   - `a` is the first element of `A`. Since `A` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume it is a list with at least one element. Let's denote the first element of `A` as `A[0]`.

2. **Determine `b`**:
   - `b` is calculated as `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is the length of `B`.
   - `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order.
   - If there are no '<' characters in `s`, `idx_B` and `B` will be empty lists, so `r` will be 0.
   - If `r` is 0, then `idx_B[r - 1]` will be out of bounds. Therefore, we need to consider the case where `r` is greater than 0.
   - If `r` is greater than 0, `idx_B[r - 1]` will be the last (smallest) index of '<' in the string `s`.

3. **Calculate `b`**:
   - If `r` is 0 (no '<' characters in `s`), `b` will be 0 because `idx_B[r - 1]` is undefined.
   - If `r` is greater than 0, `b` will be `(idx_B[r - 1] - 0) * (0 + 1) = idx_B[r - 1]`.

4. **Calculate the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`**:
   - `a * 2` is `2 * A[0]`.
   - `b * 2` is `2 * idx_B[r - 1]` if `r > 0`, otherwise it is 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `i + 1` is 1.

### Final Expression:
- If `r` is 0 (no '<' characters in `s`):
  - The expression becomes `2 * A[0] + 0 + 0 + 1 = 2 * A[0] + 1`.
- If `r` is greater than 0:
  - The expression becomes `2 * A[0] + 2 * idx_B[r - 1] + 0 + 1 = 2 * A[0] + 2 * idx_B[r - 1] + 1`.

### Output:
- If there are no '<' characters in `s`:
  - Output: **2 * A[0] + 1**
- If there are '<' characters in `s`:
  - Output: **2 * A[0] + 2 * idx_B[r - 1] + 1**

Since the exact value of `A[0]` and `idx_B[r - 1]` are not provided, we can only express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **2 * A[0] + 2 * idx_B[r - 1] + 1 (where A[0] is the first element of A and idx_B[r - 1] is the last index of '<' in the string s if r > 0, otherwise 0)**
