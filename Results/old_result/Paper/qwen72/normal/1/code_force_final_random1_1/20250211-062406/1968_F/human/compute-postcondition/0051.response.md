Output State: **`results` now includes the strings 'YES' and 'NO', all other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `results.append('NO')` adds the string 'NO' to the list `results`.
- Initially, if `x` was equal to 0, `results` already included the string 'YES'.
- After executing the given code, `results` now includes both 'YES' and 'NO'.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `idx`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
