Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), representing the number of test cases. cas_de_test is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30), representing the scores of the three players in each test case. resultats is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for p1, p2, p3 in cas_de_test:
    total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
    if total_points % 2 != 0:
        resultats.append(-1)
        continue
    total_matchs = total_points // 2
    if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
        resultats.append(-1)
        continue
    egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
    if egalites < 0:
        resultats.append(-1)
    else:
        resultats.append(egalites // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` is a list containing one element which is -1. Otherwise, `resultats` initially remains an empty list. `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` now contains one element which is -1. `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` contains one element which is -1. If `egalites` is greater than or equal to 0, `resultats` now contains one additional element which is `egalites // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `total_points` is equal to the sum of the elements of the next tuple (p1 + p2 + p3), `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If `egalites` < 0, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`. Otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing the value `egalites // 2`. If `total_matchs` > 3 or `p3` > `total_matchs`, and if `total_points` is odd, `resultats` is a list containing `-1` and the loop moves to the next iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `total_points` is equal to the sum of the elements of the next tuple (p1 + p2 + p3), `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, and `resultats` is a list. If `egalites` < 0, `resultats` contains `-1`. Otherwise, `resultats` contains one element which is `egalites // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
