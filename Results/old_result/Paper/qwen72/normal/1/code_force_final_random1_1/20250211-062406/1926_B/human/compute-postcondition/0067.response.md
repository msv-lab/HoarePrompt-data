The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the description, it implicitly accepts multiple test cases, each containing a grid. Each test case is defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) indicating the size of the grid. Each grid is represented by `n` lines of `n` characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1.

The function returns the type of shape ('triangle' or 'square') found in each grid for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing a grid of size n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) represented by '0's and '1's. It returns the type of shape ('triangle' or 'square') found in each grid for each test case.**
