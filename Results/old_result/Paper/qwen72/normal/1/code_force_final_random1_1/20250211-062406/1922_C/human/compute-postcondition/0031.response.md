Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n-3`, `n` must be at least 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1. If the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is less than the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`, then `d2[i]` is set to 1 + `d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is set to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.***
