Functionality: **The function `func` is expected to accept parameters including the number of test cases `t`, the dimensions of the grid `n` and `m`, and the grid itself, which could be a list of strings or a 2D list of characters where 'W' represents white and 'B' represents black. The function processes the grid to solve a specific problem (not detailed here) and returns the result of this processing, which could vary depending on the problem's requirements.**
