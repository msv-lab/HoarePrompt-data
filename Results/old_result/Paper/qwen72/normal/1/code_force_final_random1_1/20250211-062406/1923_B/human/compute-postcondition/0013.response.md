Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decreased by 1), `n` and `k` are specific integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new user input, `x` is a list of integers converted from the latest user input, `n` and `k` are now specific integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `a`.
- The initial state mentions that `a` is a list of integers provided by the new user input, which is consistent with the updated value of `a` after executing the code.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged, except that `a` is now updated to the new list of integers provided by the user.
