To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop head:

```python
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `j` and the expression `m - 1`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is greater than 0
   - `tc` is 1
   - `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1)
   - `m` is the new input integer and must be greater than 1
   - `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `ans` is 'YES'
   - `j` is 0
   - `impossible` is `True` unless the first character of the first string in `gr` is different from the second character of the first string in `gr`, or the first character of the last string in `gr` is different from the second character of the last string in `gr`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `j`.
   - Since `j` is currently 0, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to execute again is that `j` must be less than `m - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1.
- The loop will execute again if `1 < m - 1`, which simplifies to `m > 2`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1), `m` is the new input integer and must be greater than 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `j` is 1, `impossible` is `True` unless the first character of the first string in `gr` is different from the second character of the first string in `gr`, or the first character of the last string in `gr` is different from the second character of the last string in `gr`.**
