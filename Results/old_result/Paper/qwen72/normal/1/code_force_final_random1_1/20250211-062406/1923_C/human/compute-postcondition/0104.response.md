The only variable in the loop head is `_`, so we can only adjust this one. The loop iterates based on the value provided by `int(input())`. After each iteration, `_` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` must still be less than the value provided by `int(input())`.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is `m-1`, and `m` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the next iteration, `_` should be `m`.

State: **_ is m, `m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 â‰¤ 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.**
