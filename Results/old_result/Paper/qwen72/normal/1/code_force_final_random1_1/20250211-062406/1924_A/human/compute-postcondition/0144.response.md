Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the third character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character in `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is either equal to `(1 << k) - 1` or `1 << cur_ss`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `cur` was reset to 0 before the current operation, and `ans` includes the third character in `s`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `1 << cur_ss`.**

Explanation:
- The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1.
- All other variables (`s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, `cur`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition `if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` and the potential update to `cur` are not affected by the increment of `cnt`.
- Therefore, the only change in the state is that `cnt` is incremented by 1.
