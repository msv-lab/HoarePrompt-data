Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 4`, `n` is greater than or equal to 5, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `m` is the new input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a dictionary that will contain keys from 2 to `n` with values determined by the loop logic, and `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and contains the key `n - 1` with the value 1. If `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2` contains the key `i` with the value `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2` contains the key `i` with the value `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` and the condition `l[i] - l[i - 1] >= l[i + 1] - l[i]` is true.***
