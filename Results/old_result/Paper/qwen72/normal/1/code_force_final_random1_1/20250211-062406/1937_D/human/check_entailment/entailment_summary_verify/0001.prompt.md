You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. It calculates and prints a series of integers to the console, where each integer represents a specific value derived from the positions and counts of '<' and '>' characters in the string. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly outputs the results to the console. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the string `s` remains unchanged, and the console contains the printed integers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a grid of length `n` with characters `<` and `>`.
   - A pinball starts at a cell and moves left or right based on the character.
   - The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.
   - We need to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting cell.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It calls the function `func_1(s)` to compute the results.
   - The results are printed for each test case.

3. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - Two lists `A` and `B` are initialized to store cumulative values.
     - Two lists `idx_A` and `idx_B` are initialized to store indices of `>` and `<` respectively.
   - **Forward Pass**:
     - For each cell `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `s[i]` is `>`, it calculates the cumulative value and appends it to `A` and `idx_A`.
   - **Backward Pass**:
     - For each cell `i` from `n-1` to 0, if `s[i]` is `<`, it calculates the cumulative value and appends it to `B` and `idx_B`.
   - **Result Calculation**:
     - For each cell `i` from 0 to `n-1`, it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the cumulative values in `A` and `B`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the forward and backward passes to precompute the necessary values.
   - The result calculation for each cell is based on the precomputed values, which should accurately reflect the movement of the pinball.
   - The logic for handling different cases (when `l < r`, `r == 0`, etc.) seems to cover all possible scenarios.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle edge cases where the grid is entirely `<` or `>`.
   - It should also handle cases where the grid is a mix of `<` and `>`.

6. **Performance**:
   - The program uses linear time complexity for both the forward and backward passes, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the program and its logic, it appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The precomputation and result calculation steps are well-structured and should handle all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
