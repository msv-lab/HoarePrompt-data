The provided Python code snippet reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each part into an integer, storing these integers in the list `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `test_cases` must be greater than `n`
- `i` is `n`
- `feat` is a list of integers read from input
- `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 0
- `f` is the second element of `feat`
- `a` is the third element of `feat`
- `b` is the last element of `feat`
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input
- `array2` contains the elements it had before
- `n` is now the first element of `feat`
- `a` is the third element of `feat`

After executing the code snippet:
- `arr` is updated to contain the integers from the new input.

The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `i`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `array2` remain unchanged, except for `arr` which is now updated with the new input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than `n`, `i` is `n`, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 0, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the new input, `array2` contains the elements it had before.**
