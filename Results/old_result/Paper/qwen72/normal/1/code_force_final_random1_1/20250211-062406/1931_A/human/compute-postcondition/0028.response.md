The value of `word` is updated by concatenating `'aa'` with the character from the string `alphabet` at the index `n - 3`. The initial value of `word` is an empty string, so after the operation, `word` will be `'aa'` followed by the character at the specified index of `alphabet`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]'**.
