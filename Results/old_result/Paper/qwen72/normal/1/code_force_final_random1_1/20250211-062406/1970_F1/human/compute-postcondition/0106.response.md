The code reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. This list is then assigned to the variable `command`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input.**
