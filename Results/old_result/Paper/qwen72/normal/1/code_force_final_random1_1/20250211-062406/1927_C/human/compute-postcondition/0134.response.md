Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 + 1, `n` is the first input integer greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer greater than 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 0. Otherwise, `aOnes` is 0 and `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0, and either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is greater than `newk`.***
