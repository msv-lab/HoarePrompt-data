### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the number of permutations of length `n` that match the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function appears to be implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. However, it is not directly used to solve the permutation problem.
   - **func_2(a, b)**: This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `b` under modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and then multiplies it by `a`. This is typically used to perform division in modular arithmetic.

3. **Algorithm for Permutations**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to count the number of valid permutations that match the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The key observation is that the prefix and suffix maximums must align with the structure of the permutation. For example, if `p_i` is a prefix maximum, it must be greater than all elements before it, and if `s_i` is a suffix maximum, it must be greater than all elements after it.
   - The number of valid permutations can be computed using combinatorial methods, but the provided functions do not seem to implement this logic.

4. **Function Mismatch**:
   - The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not directly related to counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. They are more suited for modular arithmetic operations, which might be part of a larger solution but are not sufficient on their own.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as described. They are not designed to count the number of valid permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
