Reasoning:

The program aims to calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - **If the regular price for two yogurts (`2 * a`) is less than the promotional price (`b`)**: In this case, it is cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. Therefore, the total cost is `n * a`.
   - **If the regular price for two yogurts is greater than or equal to the promotional price**:
     - **If `n` is even**: The optimal strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price. The total cost is `(n * b) / 2`.
     - **If `n` is odd**: The optimal strategy is to buy as many pairs as possible at the promotional price and then buy the remaining one yogurt at the regular price. The total cost is `(n // 2) * b + a`.

3. **Output**: The program prints the calculated minimum cost for each test case.

Let's verify the correctness of the program with the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `2 * 5 < 9`, the program will output `2 * 5 = 10`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `9` (buying two yogurts at the promotional price).

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `2 * 5 < 9`, the program will output `3 * 5 = 15`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `14` (buying two yogurts at the promotional price and one at the regular price).

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `2 * 5 < 11`, the program will output `3 * 5 = 15`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `2 * 5 < 11`, the program will output `4 * 5 = 20`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `22` (buying two pairs of yogurts at the promotional price).

The program fails to correctly handle the cases where the promotional price is cheaper than the regular price for two yogurts. Specifically, it does not consider the promotional price when `2 * a < b`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
