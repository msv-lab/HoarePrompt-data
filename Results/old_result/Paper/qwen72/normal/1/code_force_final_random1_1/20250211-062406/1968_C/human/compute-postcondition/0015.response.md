The provided Python code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `x`. This operation updates the value of `x` from its initial state (which was described as a list of integers read from the input) to a new list of integers based on the new input.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500
- `x` is a list of integers read from the input
- `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000 and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is 1000 + the sum of the first `i` elements of `x`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2

After executing the code snippet:
- `x` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000 and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is 1000 + the sum of the first `i` elements of the original `x`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
