The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description provided. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases and the integer n for each test case. For example, the function should be defined as `def find_position_of_one(t, n_values):`, where `t` is the number of test cases and `n_values` is a list of integers representing the length of the array `a` for each test case. Each `n` in `n_values` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
