Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is 1, `impossible` is False.**

Explanation:
- The variable `impossible` is explicitly set to `False`.
- All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, `ans`, and `j`) retain their initial values.
- The conditions regarding the characters in the strings in `gr` remain unchanged.
