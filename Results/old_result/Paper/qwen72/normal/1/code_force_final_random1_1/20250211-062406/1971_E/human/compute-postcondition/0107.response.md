Output State: **`l` is 0, `q` is greater than 0, `m` is `m + b[s - 1]`, `i` is 1, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, and `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the element at index `s` in the list `a` is equal to `ql`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
