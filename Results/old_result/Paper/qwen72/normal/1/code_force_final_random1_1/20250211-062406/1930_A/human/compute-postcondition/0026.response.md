Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is the sum of every second element in `l` starting from index 0 up to the last even-indexed element within the range of `2 * n`, `i` is `2 * n`, and `2 * n` is greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer greater than 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `l`, `score`, `i`) and conditions (such as `l` being a sorted list of integers, `score` being the sum of every second element in `l`, `i` being `2 * n`, and `2 * n` being greater than 0) remain unchanged and retain their initial state.
