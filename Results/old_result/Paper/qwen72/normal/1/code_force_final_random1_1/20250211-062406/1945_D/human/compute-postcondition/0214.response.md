Initial State: `custos` is a list containing the calculated costs for each of the `t` test cases and must have at least two elements.

Given the code snippet:
```python
print(c)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `c` is not explicitly defined in the initial state or the code snippet.
- Since `c` is not defined, it is not clear what value it holds.
- In Python, if a variable is used that has not been defined, it will raise a `NameError`.

### Conclusion:
The code will raise a `NameError` because `c` is not defined.

Output: **NameError: name 'c' is not defined**
