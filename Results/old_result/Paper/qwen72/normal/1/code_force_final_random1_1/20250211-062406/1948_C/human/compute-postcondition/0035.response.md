Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 5, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a new string input by the user, and `i` is 5. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement.***
