The value of `y` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `y` is 1, so after the increment, `y` becomes 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the user, `x` is 3, `y` is 2, and `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / 12` and `m // 4` if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1. `n` must be at least 12 and `m` must be at least 4.**
