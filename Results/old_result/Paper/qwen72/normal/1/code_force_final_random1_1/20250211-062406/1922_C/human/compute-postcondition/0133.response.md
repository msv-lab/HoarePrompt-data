Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 3, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 3), `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `m` is the new input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by the user input, and the condition `y` > `x` or `y` ≤ `x` holds true. If `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and contains `{2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 3, 5: 4}`, and `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and is empty. Otherwise, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and contains `{2: 1, 3: 2, 4: l[3] - l[2] + d1[3], 5: l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]}`, and `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and is empty.***
