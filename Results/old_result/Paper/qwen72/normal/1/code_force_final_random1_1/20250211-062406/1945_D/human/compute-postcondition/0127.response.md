Output State: **`pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_passar_b` and `custo_pra_trocar_a` are lists of integers obtained from the input, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` remains unchanged if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, otherwise `total` is updated by adding either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on which is smaller, and `best` remains 10.**
