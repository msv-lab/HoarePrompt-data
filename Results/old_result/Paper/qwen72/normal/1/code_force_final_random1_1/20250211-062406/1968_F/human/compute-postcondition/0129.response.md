Output State: **`it1` is the index in `v1` where the first element is not less than `l`, and `it2` is the index in `v2` where the first element is not less than `r`, decremented by 1. `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, and `it2` is greater than or equal to 0. The element `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and the element `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`. `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - (n + 2) * q - 1]` and must be at least 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - (n + 2) * q - 2]` and must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2) + n + 3`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is `int(data[idx - (n + 2) * q - n + i - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is the cumulative XOR of elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to the unique values in `pf` and their respective indices as values, `results` now contains an additional 'YES' at the end, `i` is `n`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `x` is 0 if the condition `x == 0` is true, otherwise `x` retains its original value, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[r]` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[l - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`.**
