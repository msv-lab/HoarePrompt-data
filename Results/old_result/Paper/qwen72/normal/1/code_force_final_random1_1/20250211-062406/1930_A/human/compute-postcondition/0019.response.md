The code snippet `score += l[i]` updates the value of `score` by adding the value at index `i` in the list `l` to the current value of `score`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input
- `score` is `l[2 * n - 2]`
- `i` is 2 * n
- `2 * n` is greater than 0

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. `score` is initially set to `l[2 * n - 2]`.
2. `i` is set to `2 * n`.
3. The code `score += l[i]` adds the value at index `i` (which is `2 * n`) in the list `l` to the current value of `score`.

Therefore, the new value of `score` is `l[2 * n - 2] + l[2 * n]`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is `l[2 * n - 2] + l[2 * n]`, `i` is 2 * n, and `2 * n` is greater than 0.**
