Postcondition: ***`one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `t` is `t - 1`, and if `s[i + 1]` is not '0', `one` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `one` is incremented by 1. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` now includes the value `i + 2`. Otherwise, `lst` remains unchanged.***
