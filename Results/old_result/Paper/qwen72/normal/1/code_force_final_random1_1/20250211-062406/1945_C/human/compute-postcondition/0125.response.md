Output State: **`lst` must have at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in `lst`, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is updated to the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `final` now contains the first element of `lst` and `elem`.** 

Explanation: The code appends `elem` (which is the second element in `lst`) to the list `final`. If `final` was initially empty or already contained the first element of `lst` due to the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, it now also includes `elem`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
