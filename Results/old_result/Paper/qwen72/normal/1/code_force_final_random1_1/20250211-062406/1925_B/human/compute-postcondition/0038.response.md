To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `x` must be at least 1.
  - `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
  - If `x` is divisible by `i` without any remainder, and `(x - n * (x // i))` is non-negative and divisible by `x // i` without any remainder, and `x // i` is greater than 0, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`.
  - Otherwise, the values of `x`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
- At the start of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
- The loop condition is `i < int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.
- **`x`**: The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop head.
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop head.

### Updated State:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`x` must be at least 1, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`, `ans` remains unchanged**.
