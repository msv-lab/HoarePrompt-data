The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition but operates under the context of processing multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), representing the number of piles, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The total number of test cases `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each test case. However, the specific output for each test case is not defined in the provided information. Assuming the function returns a list of results corresponding to each test case, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. It returns a list of results, one for each test case.**
