Output State: **_ is incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `a` are updated to the values from the tuple `test_cases[_]`, `a` is a non-empty iterable with no elements remaining, `freq` is a list where each element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by the number of occurrences of the corresponding character in `a`, `missing` is the sum of the differences `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, `results` now includes the value of `missing` as its last element, `prob` is the last element of `a`.**

Explanation:
- The line `results.append(missing)` appends the value of `missing` to the list `results`.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `freq`, `prob`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The initial state specifies that `_` is incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `a` are updated to the values from the tuple `test_cases[_]`, `a` is a non-empty iterable with no elements remaining, `freq` is a list where each element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by the number of occurrences of the corresponding character in `a`, `missing` is the sum of the differences `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, and `prob` is the last element of `a`.
- After appending `missing` to `results`, the output state reflects these conditions with the additional information that `results` now includes the value of `missing` as its last element.
