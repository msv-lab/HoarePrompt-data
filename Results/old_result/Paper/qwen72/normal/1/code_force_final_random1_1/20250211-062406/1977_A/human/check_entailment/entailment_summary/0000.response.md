Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes in a tower after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the parity (odd/even nature) of `n` and `m`.

- If `n` is equal to `m`, it's trivially possible because Nikita can just add one cube per move.
- If `m` is greater than `n`, it's impossible because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves.
- If `m` is equal to `n - 1`, it's possible because Nikita can add one cube for each move except the last one, where he removes a cube.
- If both `n` and `m` are even or both are odd, it's possible to achieve `m` cubes. This is because adding and removing cubes in pairs (or an odd number of moves) can balance out to reach the desired number of cubes.

The provided program checks these conditions correctly:
1. It prints 'Yes' if `n` equals `m`.
2. It prints 'No' if `m` is greater than `n`.
3. It prints 'Yes' if `m` equals `n - 1`.
4. It prints 'Yes' if both `n` and `m` are even.
5. It prints 'Yes' if both `n` and `m` are odd.
6. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

These conditions cover all possible scenarios for the problem, ensuring the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
