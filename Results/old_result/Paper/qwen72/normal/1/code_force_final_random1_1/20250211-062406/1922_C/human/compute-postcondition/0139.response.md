Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `m` is the new input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a dictionary that will contain keys from 2 to `n` with values determined by the loop logic, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and now contains the key `n - 1` with the value 1. Additionally, the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`.***
