Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to understand the constraints and the effects of the operations on the array. The key points to consider are:

1. **Operation Constraints**: The operation can only be applied to indices \(2 \le i \le n-1\). This means the first and last elements cannot be directly modified by the operation.

2. **Effect of the Operation**: Each operation decreases the elements at positions \(i-1\), \(i\), and \(i+1\) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively. This means the total sum of the array decreases by 4 with each operation.

3. **Sum of Elements**: For the array to be reduced to all zeros, the total sum of the array must be divisible by 4. If the sum is not divisible by 4, it is impossible to make all elements zero.

4. **Edge Elements**: The first and last elements of the array cannot be directly modified by the operation. Therefore, they must be zero or even numbers that can be reduced to zero without affecting the rest of the array.

5. **Parity Check**: The parity (odd/even) of the first and last elements is crucial. If either the first or last element is odd and cannot be balanced by the adjacent elements, it is impossible to make the array zero.

Let's analyze the given program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Sum Check Missing**: The program does not check if the total sum of the array is divisible by 4. This is a critical condition for the array to be reducible to all zeros.
2. **Incorrect Parity Check**: The conditions `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2` and `b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2` are not sufficient to ensure the array can be reduced to zero. These conditions only check specific edge cases but do not cover all scenarios.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Check Total Sum**: Ensure the total sum of the array is divisible by 4.
2. **Check Edge Elements**: Ensure the first and last elements are either zero or can be reduced to zero without affecting the rest of the array.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the total sum is divisible by 4
        if sum(a) % 4 != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if the first and last elements can be reduced to zero
        if a[0] % 2 == 1 or a[-1] % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if the array can be reduced to zero
        for i in range(1, n-1):
            if a[i] < 2 or (a[i] % 2 != 0 and (a[i-1] % 2 != 1 or a[i+1] % 2 != 1)):
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not check the total sum of the array and has insufficient conditions for checking the parity of the first and last elements.

Correctness: **False**
