The loop head contains the variable `v` and the range parameters `na_frente` and `-1`. The loop iterates backward from `na_frente` down to `0` (inclusive). Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `v`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `v` was `na_frente - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `v` must be decremented by 1, making it `na_frente - 2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `v` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers where \(1 \leq m \leq n \leq 200,000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `b` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\), `cases` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from the input, `v` is `na_frente - 2`. If `v <= pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]`. Additionally, if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged. If `v > pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is incremented by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`. Otherwise, `total` is incremented by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]`.**
