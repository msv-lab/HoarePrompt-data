Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` and `k` are input integers, `n` must be non-zero and greater than 1, `L` is [m, m], `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now `n - ((n + 1) // 2)` and must be greater than 1 before the subtraction.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The value of `n` is updated to `n - m`, which is `n - ((n + 1) // 2)`.
- All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
