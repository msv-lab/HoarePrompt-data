The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' or 1 if no such `i` exists, `res` is the input string provided by the user. If `res` is '<', `best` is set to 1. Otherwise, `best` remains 0.**
