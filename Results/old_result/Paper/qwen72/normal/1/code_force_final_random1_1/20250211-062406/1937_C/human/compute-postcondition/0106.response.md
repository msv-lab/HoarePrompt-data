Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is initialized to `n`.
- `best` is initialized to 0.
- `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `res` is the user input.
- If `res` is '<', then `best` is updated to `n-1` and `k` remains the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 1 if no such `i` exists.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`k`**: 
   - `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 1 if no such `i` exists.
   - Since the initial state does not specify any previous values of `i` where `res` was '<', `k` will be 1.

2. **`best`**:
   - `best` is initially 0.
   - If `res` is '<', `best` is updated to `n-1`.
   - Without knowing the value of `res`, we cannot determine if `best` is 0 or `n-1`.

3. **`i`**:
   - `i` is initialized to `n`.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **If `res` is not '<'**:
  - `best` remains 0.
  - `k` remains 1.
  - `i` is `n`.

- **If `res` is '<'**:
  - `best` is updated to `n-1`.
  - `k` remains the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 1 if no such `i` exists.
  - `i` is `n`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will depend on the value of `res`. However, since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both scenarios:

- **If `res` is not '<'**:
  - Output: **? 1 0 1 n**

- **If `res` is '<'**:
  - Output: **? 1 (n-1) 1 n**

Since the exact value of `res` is not specified, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **? 1 [best] 1 n (where [best] is 0 if res is not '<' and n-1 if res is '<')**
