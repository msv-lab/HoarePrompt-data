To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is `elem` and `lst`.

1. **`lst`**: The loop will execute if `lst` is not empty. Since the state mentions that `lst` contains indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, we need to ensure that `lst` has at least one element for the loop to execute.

2. **`elem`**: This variable will take the value of the elements in `lst` during each iteration of the loop. Before the loop starts, `elem` should be set to the first element of `lst`.

Given these considerations, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`lst` contains indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 and must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in `lst`, all other variables (`final`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `mini`, `ele`) remain unchanged, `final` is an empty list.**
