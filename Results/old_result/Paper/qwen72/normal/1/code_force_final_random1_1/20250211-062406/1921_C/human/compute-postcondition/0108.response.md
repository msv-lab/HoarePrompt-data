Based on the initial state and the provided code snippet:

1. **Understanding the Initial State:**
   - `array2` is constructed based on specific conditions involving elements of `arr` and constants `a` and `b`.
   - For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If `i` is 0 and `arr[0] < b / a`, then `arr[0] * a` is appended to `array2`.
     - For any other index `i`, if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` is appended to `array2`.
   - The final state of `array2` will contain all values that meet these conditions.
   - The sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

2. **Analyzing the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is simply `print('No')`.
   - This statement does not depend on any variables or conditions; it directly prints the string `'No'`.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Regardless of the state of `array2`, `arr`, `a`, `b`, `f`, or any other variables, the print statement will always output the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
