To determine what will be printed by the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list of integers provided by user input.
   - `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1.
   - `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1.
   - `m` must be greater than 2.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `x` and `y` are updated to new integers provided by user input. If the new `y` > `x`, the condition `y` > `x` holds true. If the new `y` ≤ `x`, the condition `y` ≤ `x` holds true.

2. **Relevant Code:**
   ```python
   print(d1[y] - d1[x])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, meaning any key that does not exist in `d1` will return 0.
   - `d1[2]` is explicitly set to 1.
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input.
   - The expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` will subtract the value of `d1[x]` from `d1[y]`.

4. **Possible Values:**
   - If `y` is 2, then `d1[y]` will be 1.
   - If `y` is any other integer, `d1[y]` will be 0 (since `d1` only has `d1[2]` set to 1).
   - If `x` is 2, then `d1[x]` will be 1.
   - If `x` is any other integer, `d1[x]` will be 0.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - If `y` is 2 and `x` is 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` will be `1 - 1 = 0`.
   - If `y` is 2 and `x` is not 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` will be `1 - 0 = 1`.
   - If `y` is not 2 and `x` is 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` will be `0 - 1 = -1`.
   - If `y` is not 2 and `x` is not 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` will be `0 - 0 = 0`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will depend on the values of `x` and `y` provided by the user. However, since `d1` only has one key-value pair (`d1[2] = 1`), the possible outputs are limited to 0, 1, or -1.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] is 1 if y is 2, otherwise 0, and d1[x] is 1 if x is 2, otherwise 0)**
