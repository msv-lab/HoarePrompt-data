Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the count of '1' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where `zero * 100 // (i + 1)` and `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)` are both greater than or equal to 50, `final` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the count of '1' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `lst`, and `final` is either an empty list or a list containing `elem`, depending on whether the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the count of '1' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` must have at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in `lst`, and `final` is a list containing the first element in `lst` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in `lst` is equal to `mini`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, `final` also contains the second element in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the count of '1' characters in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` must have at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `lst`, and `final` is a list containing the first element in `lst` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in `lst` is equal to `mini`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, `final` also contains the second and third elements in `lst`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
