Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is a tuple (n, m) with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 and m being a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and the second element is a string a consisting of n characters from 'A' to 'G'. results is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m, a = test_cases[_]
    freq = [0] * 7
    for prob in a:
        freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1
    missing = sum(max(0, m - f) for f in freq)
    results.append(missing)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is managed by the `range` function, `n`, `m`, and `a` are the values from the tuple `test_cases[_]`, `a` must be a non-empty iterable, `freq` is a list where each element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` for each `prob` in `a` is incremented by 1, and all other elements remain 0, `missing` is the sum of the differences `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, `results` now includes the value of `missing` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `a` are updated to the values from the tuple `test_cases[_]`, `a` is a non-empty iterable with no elements remaining, `freq` is a list where each element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by the number of occurrences of the corresponding character in `a`, `missing` is the sum of the differences `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, `results` now includes the value of `missing` as its last element, `prob` is the last element of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `a` are updated to the values from the tuple `test_cases[_]`, `a` is a non-empty iterable with no elements remaining, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where each integer represents the count of corresponding characters (A to G) in `a`, `missing` is recalculated as the sum of the differences `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, `results` now includes the value of `missing` as its last element, `prob` is the last element of `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
