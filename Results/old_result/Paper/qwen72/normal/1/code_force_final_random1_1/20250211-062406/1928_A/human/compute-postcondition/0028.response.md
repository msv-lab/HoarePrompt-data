Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `a` and `b` are integer values from the input.
   - If both `a` and `b` are even, the condition `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0` holds.
   - Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd.
   - If `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is true, then the respective condition holds.
   - Otherwise, neither `(a - b == -a, a)` nor `(b - a == -b, b)` is true, and the difference `(a - b)` is either odd (not divisible by 2) or even (divisible by 2).
   - The range defined by the user input must be greater than 1.

2. **Conditions Analysis:**
   - The condition `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0` checks if both `a` and `b` are even.
   - The conditions `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` check specific relationships between `a` and `b`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is simply `print('yes')`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the print statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned. It simply prints the string `'yes'`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **yes**
