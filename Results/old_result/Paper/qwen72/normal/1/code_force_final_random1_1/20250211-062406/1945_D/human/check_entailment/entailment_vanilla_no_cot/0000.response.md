Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The logic in the provided solution has a flaw in how it calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to reach his desired position. Specifically, the approach of iterating from the back and deciding whether to use `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` based on which is smaller does not correctly account for the dynamic nature of the problem where Kirill can bribe multiple people to move forward.

The key issue is that the algorithm does not properly consider the cumulative cost of moving through positions, especially when Kirill needs to move past multiple people. The algorithm should maintain a more sophisticated state to track the minimum cost to reach each position, considering both the direct cost to swap with a person and the cumulative cost to pass through intermediate positions.

A correct approach would involve using a priority queue or a dynamic programming method to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each position, ensuring that Kirill's movements are optimized for the least cost while reaching his desired position within the first `m` spots.
