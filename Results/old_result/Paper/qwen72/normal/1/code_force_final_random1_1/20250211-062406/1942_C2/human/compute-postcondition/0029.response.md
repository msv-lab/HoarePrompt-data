Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `tmp` now contains one or two elements. If the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` is met, `tmp` contains the first element `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` and the second element `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, `i` is 2, `ans` is increased by `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, and `y` is decreased by `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains as it was initially, and `ans` and `y` remain unchanged.***
