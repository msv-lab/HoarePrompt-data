Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 1, `m` is the input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'NO', `j` is `m-2`. For all `i` from 0 to `n-2`, `gr[i][0] == gr[i + 1][0]` and `gr[i][m - 1] == gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, and `impossible` is `True`.**
