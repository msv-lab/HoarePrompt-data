Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new input string `s`, `b` is the string `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is the string `s` sorted in descending order. If `b` (the sorted version of `s` in ascending order) is equal to `s`, then the variables retain their initial values. Otherwise, the variables also retain their initial values.**
