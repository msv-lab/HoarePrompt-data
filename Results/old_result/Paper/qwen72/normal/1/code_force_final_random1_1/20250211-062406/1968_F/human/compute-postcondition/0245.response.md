Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is 0, `n` retains the value of the last assigned `n`, `q` is 0, `idx` is increased by the total number of elements processed in `data` (which is `t * (n + 2 + q * 2)`), `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the corresponding integer value from `data` for the last test case, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index for the last test case, `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values in `pf` and values being lists of indices where these `pf` values occur for the last test case, `results` contains the final results of the loop's operations ('YES' or 'NO' for each query across all test cases), and the last element of `results` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- `t` is decremented to 0 after all iterations of the outer loop.
- `n` and `q` are set based on the last test case.
- `idx` is incremented by the total number of elements processed in `data` for all test cases.
- `a` and `pf` are populated based on the last test case.
- `mp` contains the prefix XOR values and their indices for the last test case.
- `results` contains the results of all queries across all test cases, with an additional empty string at the end.
