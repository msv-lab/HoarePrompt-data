Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2, and `nx` is updated based on the following conditions: If `xx[2][1]` is not '?', `nx` is the sum of its initial value (based on `xx[2][1]`) and the value of `xx[2][1]`. Otherwise, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`. If neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'S'.***
