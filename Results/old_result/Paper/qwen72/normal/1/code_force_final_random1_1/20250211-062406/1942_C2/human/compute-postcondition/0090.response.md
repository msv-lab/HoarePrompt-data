The code snippet `tmp = []` reassigns the variable `tmp` to an empty list. This overrides the previous value of `tmp`, which was a list containing values that satisfy the condition `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2` for some indices `j`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `tmp` is an empty list, `ans` is `x + y - 2`.**
