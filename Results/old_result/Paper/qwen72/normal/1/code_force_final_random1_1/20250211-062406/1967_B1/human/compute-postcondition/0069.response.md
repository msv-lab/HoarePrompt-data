Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than or equal to 5, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `g` to be the integer division of `n` by `count`. Since `count` is 2, `g` is now `int(n / 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
