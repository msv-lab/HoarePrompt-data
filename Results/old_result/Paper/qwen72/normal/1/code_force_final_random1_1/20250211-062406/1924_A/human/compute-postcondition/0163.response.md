The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the constant `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2, and `k` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that were added when `cur` was reset to 0, `tmp` is 'b' if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains as it was (either an empty string or the character corresponding to `chr(ord('a') + i)`), `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 2, and if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
