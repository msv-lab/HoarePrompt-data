Output State: **`i` is 3, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers from the input split by spaces, `len(b)` is greater than 3, `bd` is a list that now includes the values `b[1] - b[0]`, `b[2] - b[1]`, `b[3] - b[2]`, and `b[3] - b[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- The list `b` remains unchanged, starting with 0 followed by the integers from the input split by spaces, and its length is still greater than 3.
- The list `bd` initially contained the differences `b[1] - b[0]`, `b[2] - b[1]`, and `b[3] - b[2]`.
- After executing the code, `bd` now includes an additional element, which is `b[3] - b[2]`. This is because `i` is 3, and `b[i] - b[i - 1]` evaluates to `b[3] - b[2]`.
