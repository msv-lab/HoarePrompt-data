The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the string representation of `i` (`str(i)`). The loop iterates over each character in `str(i)`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `str(i)` must be processed.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case.
- `N` is 200001.
- `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0.
- `pd[N]` is now the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N` plus `pd[N-1]`.
- `i` is `N`.
- `pd[i]` is now `pd[i]` plus the integer value of the next character `j` in `str(i)`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The next character `j` in `str(i)` will be the next character in the string representation of `i`.

Since `i` is currently `N` (which is 200001), the string representation of `i` is "200001". If the last iteration processed the first character '2', the next iteration will process the second character '0'.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0, `pd[N]` is now the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N` plus `pd[N-1]`, `i` is `N`, `pd[i]` is now `pd[i]` plus the integer value of the next character `j` in `str(i)`, `j` is '0'**
