Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `best` is the largest value of `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 1 if no such `i` exists.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the input integer and is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`.
- **`best`**: The variable `best` will hold the largest value of `i` for which the condition `res == '<'` was true. If no such `i` exists, `best` will remain 0.
- **`k`**: The variable `k` will hold the last value of `i` for which the condition `res == '<'` was true. If no such `i` exists, `k` will be 1.
