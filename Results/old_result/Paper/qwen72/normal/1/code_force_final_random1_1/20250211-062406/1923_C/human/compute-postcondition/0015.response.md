The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` was initially 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` was 0, the new value of `j` will be 2 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` will be 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1, `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())`, `l` is a list of integers that must contain at least two elements, `p` is a list containing elements `[0, i]`, `c` is a list containing elements `[0, j]`, `i` is 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `i` is 0, `j` is 2 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 1.**
