Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1), `m` is the new input integer and must be greater than 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `j` is 2, `impossible` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `impossible` to `False`. This change affects the state of the variable `impossible`, which was previously described as being `True` if certain conditions were met, or `False` otherwise. Now, regardless of those conditions, `impossible` is explicitly set to `False`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
