Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are still strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The lists `a` and `b` are unchanged, containing the digits from the input strings `x` and `y`, respectively. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, indicating that there now exists at least one index where `a[i-1]` is not equal to `b[i-1]`. The list `new` will contain the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices up to `i-1`, and the remaining elements will be `None`. The list `new2` will contain the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices up to `i-1`, and the remaining elements will be `None`.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are still strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The lists `a` and `b` are unchanged, containing the digits from the input strings `x` and `y`, respectively. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, indicating that there now exists at least one index where `a[i-1]` is not equal to `b[i-1]`. The list `new` will contain the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices up to `i-1`, and the remaining elements will be `None`. The list `new2` will contain the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices up to `i-1`, and the remaining elements will be `None`. The element `new[i]` is now set to the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The element `new2[i]` is now set to the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are still strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The lists `a` and `b` are unchanged, containing the digits from the input strings `x` and `y`, respectively. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, indicating that there now exists at least one index where `a[i-1]` is not equal to `b[i-1]`. The list `new` will contain the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices up to `i-1`, and the remaining elements will be `None`. The list `new2` will contain the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices up to `i-1`, and the remaining elements will be `None`. The element `new[i]` is now set to the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The element `new2[i]` is now set to the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are still strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The lists `a` and `b` are unchanged, containing the digits from the input strings `x` and `y`, respectively. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, indicating that there now exists at least one index where `a[i-1]` is not equal to `b[i-1]`. The list `new` will contain the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices up to `i-1`, and the remaining elements will be `None`. The list `new2` will contain the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices up to `i-1`, and the remaining elements will be `None`. The element `new[i]` is now set to the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The element `new2[i]` is now set to the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
