### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of a set of `n` positive integers whose sum is `x`. This GCD is referred to as the "balance" of the problem set.

2. **Key Insight**: The GCD of a set of numbers is maximized when the numbers are as evenly distributed as possible. If `x` is divisible by `n`, then the optimal solution is to have all sub-problems with difficulty `x // n`, making the GCD `x // n`.

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program iterates over all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x` can be divided into `n` parts where each part has a difficulty that is a multiple of `i`.
   - It also checks the corresponding divisor `x // i` to ensure it covers all possible divisors.
   - The maximum GCD found during this process is stored in `ans`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n = 1`, the GCD is simply `x` because the problem set consists of a single problem.
   - When `x` is not divisible by `n`, the program still finds the largest divisor that can be used to form the sub-problems.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses a loop that runs up to the square root of `x`, which is efficient for the given constraints (`1 <= x <= 10^8`).

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases.
   - It efficiently finds the maximum GCD by checking all possible divisors up to the square root of `x`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
