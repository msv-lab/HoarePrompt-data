To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the loop head and the conditions it imposes:

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
```
This loop iterates over `i` starting from 1, up to but not including `len(path_ba) - c1`, with a step of 2.

### Current State
- `path_ba` has a length greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `c1` is `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`.
- `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`.

### Conditions for the Next Iteration
For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `i` must be incremented by 2 (since the step is 2).
2. The new value of `i` must be less than `len(path_ba) - c1`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Increment `i`**: Since the current value of `i` is 1, the next value of `i` will be `1 + 2 = 3`.
2. **Check the Condition**: For the loop to continue, `3` must be less than `len(path_ba) - c1`.

### Adjusted State
- `i` is now 3.
- `len(path_ba) - c1` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

Given that `c1` is `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`, we can substitute and simplify:
- `len(path_ba) - ((len(path_ba) / 2) - 1) = (len(path_ba) / 2) + 1`.

So, for the loop to execute again:
- `(len(path_ba) / 2) + 1` must be greater than 3.
- Simplifying, `len(path_ba) / 2` must be greater than 2.
- Therefore, `len(path_ba)` must be greater than 4.

### Final Adjusted State
State: **`path_ba` has a length greater than 4, `i` is 3, `c1` is `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`, `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`**
