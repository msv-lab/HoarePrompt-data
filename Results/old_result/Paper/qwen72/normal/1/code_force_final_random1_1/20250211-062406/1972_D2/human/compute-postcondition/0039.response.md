To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the user.
- `x` is 4.
- `y` is 1.
- `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
2. `(x + y) * y <= m`

### Substituting the Initial Values:
- `x` is 4.
- `y` is 1.

So, the conditions become:
1. `(4 + 1) * 4 <= n` → `5 * 4 <= n` → `20 <= n`
2. `(4 + 1) * 1 <= m` → `5 * 1 <= m` → `5 <= m`

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions must be true.
- Therefore, `n` must be at least 20, and `m` must be at least 5.

### Final State:
Since `n` and `m` are provided by the user and must be positive integers, we need to ensure that they meet the conditions for the loop to execute. The other variables (`x`, `y`, and `cnt`) do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head conditions.

State: **`n` must be at least 20, `m` must be at least 5, `x` is 4, `y` is 1, and `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.**
