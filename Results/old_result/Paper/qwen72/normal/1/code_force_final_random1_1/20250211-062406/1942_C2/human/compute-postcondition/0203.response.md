To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `x - 1`.
   - `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`.
   - `gap` is the last element in `odd`.
   - `odd` is a non-empty list of gaps that are greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order.
   - `even` is a list of gaps that are greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order.
   - `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in `odd` plus the sum of all elements in `even`.
   - `y` is decreased by the sum of half of each element in `odd` (integer division) plus the sum of half of each element in `even` (integer division).

2. **Calculating `ans`:**
   - `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in `odd` and the sum of all elements in `even`.
   - Let's denote the sum of all elements in `odd` as `sum_odd`.
   - Let's denote the sum of all elements in `even` as `sum_even`.
   - Therefore, `ans` is increased by `sum_odd + sum_even`.

3. **Final Value of `ans`:**
   - Since the initial value of `ans` is not provided, we assume it starts at 0 (or some other initial value, but this is not specified).
   - The final value of `ans` will be `sum_odd + sum_even`.

Given the above, the `print(ans)` statement will print the sum of all elements in the `odd` list plus the sum of all elements in the `even` list.

Output: **sum_odd + sum_even (where sum_odd is the sum of all elements in the `odd` list and sum_even is the sum of all elements in the `even` list)**
