To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

1. **Variable `j`:** This variable is initialized by the `range(0, n)` function, so it starts at 0.
2. **Variable `n`:** For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not run.

Given the initial state:
- `i` will be `n-1` after the loop has executed all iterations.
- `idx_A` will contain the indices of all occurrences of '>' in the string `s`.
- `A` will contain the calculated values based on the positions of '>' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop.
- If there are no '>' characters in `s`, both `A` and `idx_A` will remain empty lists.
- `B` is an empty list.
- `idx_B` is an empty list.

However, these details are not relevant to the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The only necessary adjustments are for `j` and `n`.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
