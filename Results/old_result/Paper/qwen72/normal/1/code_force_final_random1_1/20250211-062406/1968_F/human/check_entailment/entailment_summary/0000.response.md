Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once and processes it using an index (`idx`) to keep track of the current position in the input data. This approach is efficient and avoids the overhead of reading input multiple times.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix XOR for the array `a` and stores it in the `pf` list. This allows for quick computation of the XOR of any subarray using the formula `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.

3. **Mapping Prefix XORs**: The program uses a dictionary `mp` to map each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this value occurs. This helps in quickly finding the positions where the same XOR value appears, which is crucial for determining if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

4. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program checks if the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` is zero. If it is, the subarray is trivially interesting, and the program appends 'YES' to the results. If the XOR is not zero, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find if there are indices within the subarray where the same XOR value appears, indicating that the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.

5. **Output Formatting**: The program appends an extra newline after the results of each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summary, the program seems to handle all aspects of the problem correctly and efficiently.

Correctness: **True**
