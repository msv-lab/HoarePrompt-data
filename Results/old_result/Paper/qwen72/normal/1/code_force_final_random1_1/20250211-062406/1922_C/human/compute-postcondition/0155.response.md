To determine what will be printed by the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `l` is a list of integers provided by user input.
   - `m` is a new input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by user input, with `y` being greater than `x`.
   - `d1` is a dictionary that will contain keys from 2 to `n` with values determined by the loop logic.
   - `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and contains the key `n - 1` with the value 1.

2. **Dictionary `d1` Construction:**
   - The keys of `d1` range from 2 to `n`.
   - The values of `d1` are determined by the loop logic, but the specific logic is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we need to assume that `d1` is populated with some values based on the loop logic.

3. **Values of `x` and `y`:**
   - `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by user input, and `y` is greater than `x`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` will print the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.

Since the specific values of `d1` are not explicitly provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] is the value of d1 at key y and d1[x] is the value of d1 at key x)**

This output describes the result of the subtraction operation between the values of `d1` at keys `y` and `x`, based on the initial state and the provided information.
