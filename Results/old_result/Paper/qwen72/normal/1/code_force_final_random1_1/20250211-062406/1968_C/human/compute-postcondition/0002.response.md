The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500
- `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5
- The input value must be greater than 0

After executing the code:
- `x` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input.
- The length of `x` is now determined by the number of integers provided in the input.

The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, the input value must be greater than 0.**
