Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
- `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1.
- `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1.
- `m` is a new input integer and must be greater than 2.
- `j` is 2.
- `x` and `y` are a new pair of integers provided by the user input.
  - If `y` > `x`, the condition `y` > `x` holds true.
  - If `y` ≤ `x`, the condition `y` ≤ `x` holds true.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(d2[y] - d2[x])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Defaultdict Initialization**:
   - `d2` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `int`, meaning any key that is not explicitly set will return 0.
   - `d2[n - 1]` is explicitly set to 1.

2. **User Input**:
   - `x` and `y` are provided by the user.
   - The conditions `y > x` or `y ≤ x` are given, but they do not affect the value of `d2[y]` or `d2[x]`.

3. **Value of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`**:
   - If `y` is equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[y]` will be 1.
   - If `y` is not equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[y]` will be 0 (default value for defaultdict with int).
   - Similarly, if `x` is equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[x]` will be 1.
   - If `x` is not equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[x]` will be 0.

4. **Calculation**:
   - The expression `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be:
     - 1 - 0 = 1 if `y == n - 1` and `x != n - 1`.
     - 0 - 1 = -1 if `y != n - 1` and `x == n - 1`.
     - 1 - 1 = 0 if both `y` and `x` are equal to `n - 1`.
     - 0 - 0 = 0 if both `y` and `x` are not equal to `n - 1`.

### Conclusion:
The output will depend on the values of `x` and `y` relative to `n - 1`. Given the conditions, the possible outputs are 1, -1, or 0.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] is 1 if y == n - 1, otherwise 0, and d2[x] is 1 if x == n - 1, otherwise 0)**
