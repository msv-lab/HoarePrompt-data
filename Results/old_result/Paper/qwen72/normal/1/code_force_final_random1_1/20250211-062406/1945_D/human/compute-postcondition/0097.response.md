Output State: **`pos_final` is decreased by the number of iterations, `total` is the cumulative sum of the smaller costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each iteration, `best` is the minimum value between the initial `best` and the sum of `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each iteration where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `v` is 0, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` and `pos_final` are updated with the values from `input().split()`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.**
