Postcondition: ***`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and the value at `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` depending on whether `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0. `rest` is updated to `k - 2*delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `pos` is incremented by 1, and the element at `sorted_indices[pos-1]` in `a` is reduced by `delta`. Otherwise, the element at `sorted_indices[pos]` in `a` is reduced by `delta`. In both cases, `distance` is incremented by 1, and the values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged.***
