To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than `m`.
- `i` is initialized as `n - m - 1`.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `k` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `b` is a list of integers.
- `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`.
- `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`.

### Code Logic:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `cnt_b` is a dictionary that counts the occurrences of elements in `b`.
   - `b_values` is a set of unique elements from `b`.

2. **Loop through `a`:**
   - For each `i` in the range from 0 to `n - m - 1`:
     - If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, increment `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1.
     - If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, decrement `curr` by 1.
     - If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, decrement `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1.
     - If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, increment `curr` by 1.
     - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, increment `ans` by 1.

### Explanation:
- The code is essentially sliding a window of size `m` over the list `a` and checking how many times the count of elements in this window (that are also in `b`) meets or exceeds `k`.
- `ans` keeps track of the number of such valid windows.

### Final Output:
- The value of `ans` will be the total number of times the count of elements in the sliding window (that are also in `b`) is greater than or equal to `k`.

Given the initial state and the logic, the final value of `ans` will be the result of the described process. Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `m`, and `k` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `ans`. However, the output will be the total number of valid windows as described.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total number of times the count of elements in the sliding window of size m in list a, that are also in list b, is greater than or equal to k)**
