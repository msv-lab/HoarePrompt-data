The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `j` must still be less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, `j` is 2. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'F', then `a[1]` is incremented by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', then `b[1]` is incremented by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', then neither `a[1]` nor `b[1]` is incremented.**
