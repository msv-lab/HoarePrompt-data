Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `mov`, and `grid` remain unchanged. `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, and `nxt` is (`pos[0]` + `mov[com][0]`, `pos[1]` + `mov[com][1]`). If `obj == '.B'` and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` or if `isPlayer(obj)` and `elements['.B'] == nxt`, then `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. Otherwise, if `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`. If `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)` and `points[team]` is increased by 1. If `com` is not 'T' and `isPlayer(obj)` is true, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]` before the update, `nxt` is (`pos[0]` + `mov[com][0]`, `pos[1]` + `mov[com][1]`), and `elements[obj]` is now `nxt`. If `com` is not 'T' and `isPlayer(obj)` is false, `pos` remains the value of `elements[obj]` and `nxt` is (`pos[0]` + `mov[com][0]`, `pos[1]` + `mov[com][1]`).***
