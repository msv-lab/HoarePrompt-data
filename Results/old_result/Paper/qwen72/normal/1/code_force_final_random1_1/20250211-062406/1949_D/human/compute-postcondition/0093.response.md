Postcondition: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the next `n` elements are the input strings corresponding to each iteration, `a` and `b` are updated based on the transitions in the input strings, `i` is 1, `sa` is an empty list, and `sb` is an empty list. Additionally, the current value of `a[i]` is greater than 0, and the current value of `b[i]` is 0.**
