Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the second character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character in `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If the bitwise AND of `cur` and `1 << cur_ss` is 0, then `cur` is incremented by `1 << cur_ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.***
