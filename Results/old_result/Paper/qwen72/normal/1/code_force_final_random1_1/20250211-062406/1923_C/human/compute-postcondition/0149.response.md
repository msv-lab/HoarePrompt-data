Output State: **`m` is greater than 0 but less than its current value, `a` and `b` are updated to the new values provided by the user input, `i` is now equal to `c[b] - c[a - 1]` with the new values of `a` and `b`, and `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]` with the new values of `a` and `b`. If `(b - a + 1)` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, then these conditions hold true. Otherwise, either `(b - a + 1)` is less than or equal to 1, or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`.**
