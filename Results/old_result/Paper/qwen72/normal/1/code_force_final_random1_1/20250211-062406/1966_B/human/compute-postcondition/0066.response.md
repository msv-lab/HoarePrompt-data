The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` being less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `m` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `m` must still be greater than 2 for the condition `j < m - 1` to hold true.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1), `m` is the new input integer and must be greater than 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `j` is 2. If `gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.**
