### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if the player can kill all monsters before any of them reach the player's position (0).
   - Each second, the player can fire up to `k` bullets at the monsters.
   - Monsters move 1 unit closer to the player each second.
   - If a monster reaches the player, the player loses.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1(a, x, k):**
     - This function takes the health of the monsters (`a`), their positions (`x`), and the number of bullets per second (`k`).
     - It sorts the monsters based on their distance from the player (using `abs(x[i])`).
     - It then iterates through the sorted list, attempting to kill the monsters before they reach the player.
     - The `distance` variable keeps track of how many seconds have passed.
     - The `pos` variable tracks the current position in the sorted list of monsters.
     - The inner loop fires bullets at the current monster until it is killed or the bullet limit is reached.
     - If a monster reaches the player (i.e., `abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`), the function returns `False`.
     - If all monsters are killed before reaching the player, the function returns `True`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where the number of monsters is greater than the number of bullets per second.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the monsters are already very close to the player.

4. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the result.

5. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound. It correctly simulates the process of firing bullets and moving monsters.
   - The sorting step ensures that we prioritize killing the closest monsters first, which is crucial for survival.
   - The function correctly checks if any monster reaches the player and returns the appropriate result.

6. **Verification Using Function Summaries:**
   - The function summary for `func_2` confirms that it processes multiple test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, printing the correct output based on the result of `func_1`.
   - The function summary for `func_1` aligns with the problem requirements and the logic described in the original assessment.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and should work as expected for the provided problem description.

Final: **True**
