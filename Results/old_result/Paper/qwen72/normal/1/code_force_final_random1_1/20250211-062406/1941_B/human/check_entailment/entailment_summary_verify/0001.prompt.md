You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    1 3 5 5 2
    
    5

    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the first element of the array is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element of the array is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2. If either condition is met, the function prints 'NO' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function completes and no further changes are made to the input variables.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to understand the constraints and the effects of the operations on the array. The key points to consider are:

1. **Operation Constraints**: The operation can only be applied to indices \(2 \le i \le n-1\). This means the first and last elements cannot be directly modified by the operation.

2. **Effect of the Operation**: Each operation decreases the elements at positions \(i-1\), \(i\), and \(i+1\) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively. This means the total sum of the array decreases by 4 with each operation.

3. **Sum of Elements**: For the array to be reduced to all zeros, the total sum of the array must be divisible by 4. If the sum is not divisible by 4, it is impossible to make all elements zero.

4. **Edge Elements**: The first and last elements of the array cannot be directly modified by the operation. Therefore, they must be zero or even numbers that can be reduced to zero without affecting the rest of the array.

5. **Parity Check**: The parity (odd/even) of the first and last elements is crucial. If either the first or last element is odd and cannot be balanced by the adjacent elements, it is impossible to make the array zero.

Let's analyze the given program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Sum Check Missing**: The program does not check if the total sum of the array is divisible by 4. This is a critical condition for the array to be reducible to all zeros.
2. **Incorrect Parity Check**: The conditions `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2` and `b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2` are not sufficient to ensure the array can be reduced to zero. These conditions only check specific edge cases but do not cover all scenarios.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Check Total Sum**: Ensure the total sum of the array is divisible by 4.
2. **Check Edge Elements**: Ensure the first and last elements are either zero or can be reduced to zero without affecting the rest of the array.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the total sum is divisible by 4
        if sum(a) % 4 != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if the first and last elements can be reduced to zero
        if a[0] % 2 == 1 or a[-1] % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if the array can be reduced to zero
        for i in range(1, n-1):
            if a[i] < 2 or (a[i] % 2 != 0 and (a[i-1] % 2 != 1 or a[i+1] % 2 != 1)):
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not check the total sum of the array and has insufficient conditions for checking the parity of the first and last elements.
