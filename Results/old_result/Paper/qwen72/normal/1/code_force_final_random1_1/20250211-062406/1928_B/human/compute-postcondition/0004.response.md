The value of `tem` is appended to the list `ans`. Since `tem` is defined as `arr[len(arr) - 1]`, which is the last element of `arr`, the list `ans` now contains this last element. The values of `arr`, `tem`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, `tem` is `arr[len(arr) - 1]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.**
