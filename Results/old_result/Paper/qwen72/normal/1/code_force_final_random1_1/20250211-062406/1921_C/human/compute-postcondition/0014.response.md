The code appends a new element to `array2`. This element is calculated as the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of `arr`, multiplied by `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `a` is the third element of `feat`.

The new element appended to `array2` is `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`.

Since `array2` was either empty or contained one element before this operation, it now contains one or two elements.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `feat` is a list of integers read from input, `n` is the first element of `feat` and must be greater than 2, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `array2` now contains either one element `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a` or two elements, the second being `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`.**
