The code snippet `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `ar`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input
- `res` is a list of integers where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`
- `mex` is the result of repeatedly subtracting each element of `ar` from the initial value `n` as long as `mex > mex - ar[i]` holds true

After executing the code snippet, the list `ar` is updated to contain the integers provided by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `res`, and `mex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `res` is a list of integers where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `mex` is the result of repeatedly subtracting each element of `ar` from the initial value `n` as long as `mex > mex - ar[i]` holds true.**
