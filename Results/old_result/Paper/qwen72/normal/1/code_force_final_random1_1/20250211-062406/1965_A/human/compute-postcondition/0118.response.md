Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If the difference between any two consecutive elements in `lis` is at most 1, `test` is True. Otherwise, `test` is False.***
