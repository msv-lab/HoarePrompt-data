Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers from the input.
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
- `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`.
- `A` is an odd integer.
- `X` is `A // 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(X * C + B)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - `A` is an odd integer.
   - `B` and `C` are integers.
   - `B * 2 >= C`.
   - `int(input()) > 0` (This constraint is not directly relevant to the calculation of `X * C + B`).

2. **Calculation of `X`:**
   - Since `A` is an odd integer, `A // 2` will give the integer division result of `A` by 2.
   - For example, if `A = 5`, then `X = 5 // 2 = 2`.

3. **Expression `X * C + B`:**
   - `X` is `A // 2`.
   - `X * C` is the product of `X` and `C`.
   - `X * C + B` is the sum of `X * C` and `B`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the constraints, the expression `X * C + B` will be evaluated as follows:
- `X` is `A // 2`.
- The final output will be the result of `X * C + B`.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A is an odd integer, B and C are integers, and B * 2 >= C)**
