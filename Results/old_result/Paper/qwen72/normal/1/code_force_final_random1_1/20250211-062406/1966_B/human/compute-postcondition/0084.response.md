Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1), `m` is the new input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`. If any pair of adjacent strings in `gr` have different first or last characters, then `impossible` is `False` and `ans` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True` and `ans` is 'YES' if any pair of adjacent characters in the first string or the last string of `gr` are different, otherwise `ans` is 'NO'.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-2` (inclusive), so after all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`.
- The variable `j` remains unchanged as `m-2`.
- The loop checks if the first or last character of each pair of adjacent strings in `gr` are different. If any such pair is found, `impossible` is set to `False` and `ans` is set to 'YES'.
- If no such pair is found, `impossible` remains `True` and `ans` is determined based on whether any pair of adjacent characters in the first or last string of `gr` are different. If they are different, `ans` is 'YES'; otherwise, `ans` is 'NO'.
