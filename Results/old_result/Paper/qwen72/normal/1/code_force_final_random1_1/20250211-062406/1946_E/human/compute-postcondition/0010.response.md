To determine the output state, we need to consider the function `func_1(b, a % b)` and its impact on the variables `c` and `d`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we can only infer the changes based on the given initial state and the assignment.

Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are integers where `b > 0`.
- `a >= b`.
- `a % b != 0`.

Code Snippet:
```python
c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
```

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. The function `func_1` is called with arguments `b` and `a % b`.
2. The function returns two values, which are assigned to `c` and `d`.
3. Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d` without additional information. However, we know that `c` and `d` are now assigned the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`.

Output State:
- `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
- `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`.
- The conditions `b > 0`, `a >= b`, and `a % b != 0` still hold true.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers where `b > 0`, `a >= b`, and `a % b != 0`; `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`.**
