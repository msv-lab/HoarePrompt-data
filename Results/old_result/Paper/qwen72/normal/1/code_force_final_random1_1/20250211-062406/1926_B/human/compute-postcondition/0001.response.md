To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

- The variable `i` is the loop counter and will start at 0.
- The variable `a` determines how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute at least once, `a` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10.
- The grid is represented by n lines of n characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'.
- The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1.
- `a` is an input integer.

The only variables that affect the loop's execution are `i` and `a`. To ensure the loop runs at least once, `a` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, the grid is represented by n lines of n characters (each character is either '0' or '1'), the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
