Output State: **`alp` is a list of lowercase English alphabets, `j` is `l-1`, `l` is the new input integer, `ans` is updated by appending `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for each iteration from `j=0` to `j=l-1`, `i` is `l`, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user, `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.**

Explanation:
- `rev_array` is now the reversed version of `array`.
- All other variables (`alp`, `j`, `l`, `ans`, `i`, `array`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
