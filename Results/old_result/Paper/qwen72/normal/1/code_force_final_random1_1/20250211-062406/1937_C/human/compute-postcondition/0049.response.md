Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `res` is an input string.
   - If `res` is `<`, then `k` is 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `k`:**
   - According to the initial state, if `res` is `<`, then `k` is 2.
   - Since the value of `res` is not explicitly provided, we assume it is `<` as per the condition given.

4. **Substitute the Values:**
   - `?` is a string literal.
   - `0` is a constant integer.
   - `k` is 2 (as determined from the condition).
   - Another `0` is a constant integer.
   - `i` is 3 (as given in the initial state).

5. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will concatenate these values into a single string with spaces between them.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **? 0 2 0 3**
