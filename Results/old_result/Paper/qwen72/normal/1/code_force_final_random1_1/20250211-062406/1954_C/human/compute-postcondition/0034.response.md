Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `b` is a list of integers derived from the input string, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `new` is a list where the first `i` elements are `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the rest are `None`, `new2` is a list where the first `i+1` elements are `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1` and `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j=i`, and the rest are `None`, `i` is the index where `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` or `i` is equal to `len(a)`, and `a[j]` is equal to `b[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i-1`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, `new[i-1]` is now `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, `new2[i-1]` is now `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, `new[i]` is now `min(a[i], b[i])`, and `new2[i]` is now `max(a[i], b[i])`. `i` is incremented by 1.**
