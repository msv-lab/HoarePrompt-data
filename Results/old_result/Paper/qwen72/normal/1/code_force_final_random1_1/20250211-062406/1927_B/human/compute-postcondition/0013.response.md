To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations involved:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
- `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 0.
- `array` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'.
- `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.
- `ans` is a list containing `l` elements, each element being the character from `alp` indexed by the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` minus 1.
- `j` is `l-1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Reversing `array`**:
   - `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.

2. **Generating `ans`**:
   - For each `j` from `l-1` down to 0:
     - Count the occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the sublist `rev_array[j:]`.
     - Subtract 1 from this count to get the index in `alp`.
     - Append the character from `alp` at this index to `ans`.

3. **Printing `ans`**:
   - The `print` statement joins the elements of `ans` into a single string and prints it.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the following values for simplicity:
- `array = [1, 2, 1, 3, 1]`
- `l = 3`

1. **Reversing `array`**:
   - `rev_array = [1, 3, 1, 2, 1]`

2. **Generating `ans`**:
   - For `j = 2` (last element of `rev_array`):
     - `rev_array[2] = 1`
     - Count of `1` in `rev_array[2:]` is 2.
     - Index in `alp` is `2 - 1 = 1`.
     - Character at index 1 in `alp` is 'b'.
   - For `j = 1`:
     - `rev_array[1] = 3`
     - Count of `3` in `rev_array[1:]` is 1.
     - Index in `alp` is `1 - 1 = 0`.
     - Character at index 0 in `alp` is 'a'.
   - For `j = 0`:
     - `rev_array[0] = 1`
     - Count of `1` in `rev_array[0:]` is 3.
     - Index in `alp` is `3 - 1 = 2`.
     - Character at index 2 in `alp` is 'c'.

3. **Final `ans`**:
   - `ans = ['c', 'a', 'b']`

4. **Printing `ans`**:
   - `''.join(map(str, ans))` results in the string "cab".

### Final Output:
Output: **"cab" (where "cab" is the string formed by joining the characters in `ans`)**

This output is based on the specific example values provided. In general, the output will be a string of length `l` where each character is determined by the count of the corresponding element in the reversed array.
