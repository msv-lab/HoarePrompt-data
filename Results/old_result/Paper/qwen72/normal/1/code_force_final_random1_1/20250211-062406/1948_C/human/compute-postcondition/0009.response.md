Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `i` is 1. If (i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<') or (a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'), the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement.***
