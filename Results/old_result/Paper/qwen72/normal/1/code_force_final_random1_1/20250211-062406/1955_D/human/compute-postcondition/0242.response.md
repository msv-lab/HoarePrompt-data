To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic described:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - m - 1`, where `n` is greater than `m`.
   - `m` is the length of the list `b`.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `b` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `curr` is the final number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative.
   - For each element `x` in `a` that is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[x]` is decremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a` up to the point where `cnt_b[x]` becomes negative.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by the number of times the condition `curr >= k` was true during the loop's execution.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` is the length of the list `a`.
   - `m` is the length of the list `b`.
   - `i` is set to `n - m - 1`, which means it is the index just before the last `m` elements of `a`.
   - `b_values` is a set of unique values from the list `b`.
   - `cnt_b` is a dictionary that keeps track of the count of each element in `b`.
   - `curr` is the count of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b`.
   - `ans` is the number of times the condition `curr >= k` was true during the loop's execution.

3. **Execution of the Code:**
   - The loop iterates through the elements of `a` starting from the end and moving towards the beginning.
   - For each element `x` in `a` that is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[x]` is decremented.
   - If `cnt_b[x]` becomes negative, it stops decrementing for that element.
   - `curr` is updated to reflect the number of valid elements (those with non-negative counts in `cnt_b`).
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the final value of `ans`, which is the number of times the condition `curr >= k` was true during the loop's execution.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be the value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of times the condition curr >= k was true during the loop's execution)**
