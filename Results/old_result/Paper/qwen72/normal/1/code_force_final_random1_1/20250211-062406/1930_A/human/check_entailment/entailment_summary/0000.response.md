Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem by sorting the list of integers and then summing up every other element starting from the first one. This approach works because, after sorting, the smallest elements are placed at the beginning of the list. By selecting every second element (starting from the first), we ensure that we are always picking the smaller of the pairs formed by consecutive elements in the sorted list. This method guarantees that we maximize the score since we are always adding the minimum value of each pair, which is the optimal strategy according to the problem statement.

The program correctly handles multiple test cases and processes the input as specified. It sorts the list of integers, iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2, and accumulates the sum of the selected elements. Finally, it prints the score for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summary, the program behaves as expected and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
