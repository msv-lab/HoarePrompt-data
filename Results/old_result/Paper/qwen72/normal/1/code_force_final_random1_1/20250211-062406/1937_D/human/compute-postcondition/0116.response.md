Postcondition: ***`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 0, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty lists. `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `n` is greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of the string `s` is not '>'. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `a` is updated to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` if `l` is not 0, and `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `l` is greater than `r`, `a` is now equal to the last element of `B`, and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` using the original value of `b` which is the element at index `l - 1` in list `A`.***
