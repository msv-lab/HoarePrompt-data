Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `b` is a list of integers derived from the input string, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9, `new` is a list where the first `i` elements are `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the rest are `None`, `new2` is a list where the first `i` elements are `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the rest are `None`, `i` is the index where `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` or `i` is equal to `len(a)`, and `a[j]` is equal to `b[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i-1`.** 

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the lists `new` and `new2` will have their first `i` elements filled with the maximum and minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` respectively, up to the point where `a` and `b` differ or until the end of the list. The variable `i` will indicate the position where `a` and `b` first differ or the length of the list if they are identical.
