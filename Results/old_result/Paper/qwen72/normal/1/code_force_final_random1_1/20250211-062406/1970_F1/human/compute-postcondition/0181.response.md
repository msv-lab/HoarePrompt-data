Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `mov`, `grid`, and `player` remain unchanged, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is (`pos[0]` + `mov[com][0]`, `pos[1]` + `mov[com][1]`).** 

Explanation: The variable `nxt` is updated to a new tuple, which is the result of adding the corresponding elements of `pos` and `mov[com]`. All other variables retain their original values as specified in the initial state.
