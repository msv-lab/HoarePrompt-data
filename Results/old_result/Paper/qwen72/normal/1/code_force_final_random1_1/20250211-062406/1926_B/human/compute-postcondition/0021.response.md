Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10.
- The grid is represented by `n` lines of `n` characters (each character is either '0' or '1').
- The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1.
- `a` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in each input string `b` that contained at least one '1'. If no input strings contained any '1', `k` remains an empty list.
- Additionally, `k[0]` is not equal to `k[1]`.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('TRIANGLE')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'TRIANGLE'` to the console. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **TRIANGLE**
