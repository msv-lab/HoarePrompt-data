Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes the lists `a` and `b` with an extra zero at the beginning to handle the starting point (0, 0). It also initializes `ad` and `bd` to store the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, respectively.

3. **Speed Calculation**: The program calculates the speed `v` for each segment between the known points using the formula `v[i] = ad[i] / bd[i]`. This is correct because the speed is the ratio of the distance traveled to the time taken.

4. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment in which the query point `ql` lies. If `ql` is exactly at one of the known points, it directly prints the corresponding time. Otherwise, it calculates the time taken to reach `ql` by adding the time to reach the previous known point and the additional time to travel the remaining distance within the segment.

5. **Time Calculation**: The time calculation `m += b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` is correct. It adds the time to reach the previous known point and the time to travel the remaining distance within the segment, ensuring the result is rounded down to the nearest integer using `int(m)`.

6. **Output**: The program prints the results for each query, separated by spaces, and moves to the next line after processing all queries for a test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
