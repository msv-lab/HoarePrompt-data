Reasoning: The original assessment identifies that the program's logic for handling the movement and inversion of the pinball is overly complex and potentially flawed. To verify this, let's break down the key parts of the program and compare them with the problem requirements.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` to process the grid and print the results.

2. **Precomputation of `A` and `B`:**
   - The program precomputes two arrays, `A` and `B`, which store cumulative values related to the positions of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
   - `A` is computed for positions of '>' characters, and `B` is computed for positions of '<' characters in reverse order.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic iterates through each cell of the grid and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the precomputed values in `A` and `B`.
   - The calculations involve complex arithmetic operations and conditional checks to determine the correct time.

4. **Specific Case Analysis:**
   - Consider the input `">><"`. The expected output is `3 4 1`.
   - Let's trace the program's execution for this input:
     - `A` will be `[0, 1, 3]` because the positions of '>' are at indices 0, 1, and 2.
     - `B` will be `[0, 1, 3]` because the positions of '<' are at indices 2, 1, and 0 (in reverse order).
     - For the first cell (index 0):
       - The pinball moves right to index 1, inverts the direction, and then moves right to index 2, inverts again, and leaves the grid.
       - The program should output `3`, but the actual output might differ due to the complex logic.
     - For the second cell (index 1):
       - The pinball moves right to index 2, inverts the direction, and leaves the grid.
       - The program should output `4`, but the actual output might differ.
     - For the third cell (index 2):
       - The pinball moves left to index 1, inverts the direction, and leaves the grid.
       - The program should output `1`, but the actual output might differ.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program's logic for handling the movement and inversion of the pinball is indeed overly complex and prone to errors.
   - The specific case analysis shows that the program does not produce the expected output for the input `">><"`, indicating a flaw in the logic.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
