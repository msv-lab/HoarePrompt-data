Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is at least 1 and does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `A` is False; `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 3 elements, including 1; `i` is 3. If `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, then `not_c` is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `not_c` remains True.***
