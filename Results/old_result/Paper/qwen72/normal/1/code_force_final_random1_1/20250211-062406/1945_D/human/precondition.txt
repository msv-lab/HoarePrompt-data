t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three elements: n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000), a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and a list of n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
