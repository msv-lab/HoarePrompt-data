### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads input from `open(0)`, which is a shorthand for reading from standard input.
   - It skips the first line (which contains the number of test cases) and processes each subsequent line as a test case.

2. **Variable Assignment:**
   - For each test case, it splits the line into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

3. **Adjusting Extroverts:**
   - The program adds the number of universals (`c`) to the number of extroverts (`b`). This is because universals can be used to fill the requirements of extroverts who need to share a tent with two others.

4. **Calculating Tents:**
   - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is used to determine the number of tents needed:
     - `-b // 3` calculates the number of full tents required for extroverts. The negative sign is used to ensure that the division rounds towards zero, effectively rounding up.
     - `a - -b // 3` calculates the total number of tents needed by adding the number of introverts (each needing their own tent) to the number of tents required for extroverts.
     - The condition `[c < b % 3]` checks if there are enough universals to satisfy the remaining extroverts. If `c < b % 3`, it means there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots, and the program outputs `-1`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The logic for calculating the number of tents is correct. It ensures that introverts get their own tents and tries to use universals to fill the remaining spots for extroverts.
  - The condition `c < b % 3` correctly identifies when it is impossible to satisfy the extroverts' requirements.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as when there are no participants (`a = b = c = 0`), which correctly outputs `0`.
  - It also handles large inputs within the given constraints.

### Detailed Evaluation:
- **Introverts:**
  - Each introvert needs a separate tent, so `a` tents are required for introverts.
- **Extroverts:**
  - Each tent for extroverts must have exactly 3 people. The number of full tents required for extroverts is `b // 3`.
  - The remaining extroverts are `b % 3`. To accommodate these, we need to check if there are enough universals (`c`).
- **Universals:**
  - Universals can be used to fill the remaining spots for extroverts. If `c >= b % 3`, then the remaining extroverts can be accommodated.
  - If `c < b % 3`, it is impossible to satisfy the extroverts' requirements, and the program outputs `-1`.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. It handles all edge cases and constraints as specified in the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
