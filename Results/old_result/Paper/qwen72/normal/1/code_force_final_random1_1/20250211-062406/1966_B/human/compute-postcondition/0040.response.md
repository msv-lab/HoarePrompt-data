Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 1, `m` is the input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'NO' if `impossible` was `True`, `j` is `m-2`. If any of the conditions `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` were true for any `i` from 0 to `n-2`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `tc` remains 0.
- The variable `n` is still the input integer and must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
- The variable `m` is still the input integer.
- The variable `gr` is still a list containing `n` input strings.
- The variable `i` is now `n-1`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `ans` is 'NO' if `impossible` was `True` before the loop started.
- The variable `j` remains `m-2`.
- The variable `impossible` will be `False` if any of the conditions `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` were true for any `i` from 0 to `n-2`. If none of these conditions were true, `impossible` remains `True`.
