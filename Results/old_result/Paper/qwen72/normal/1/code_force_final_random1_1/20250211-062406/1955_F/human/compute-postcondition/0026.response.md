Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is `cnt + sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a)`, `x` is the last element of `a`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `cnt` will have been incremented by the floor division of each element in the list `a` by 2. The value of `x` will be the last element of the list `a` because the loop iterates over each element of `a` in order. The other variables (`t` and `p_i`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
