The code appends the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given the initial state, let's break down the changes:

- `i` is 2.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements.

So, the value being appended to `tmp` is calculated as follows:
- `a[2] - a[1]` gives the difference between the third and second elements of the list `a`.
- This difference is then integer divided by 2, resulting in `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `tmp` now contains one element, which is `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an input integer, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `tmp` is a list containing the single element `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, and `ans` is initially `x + y - 2`.**
