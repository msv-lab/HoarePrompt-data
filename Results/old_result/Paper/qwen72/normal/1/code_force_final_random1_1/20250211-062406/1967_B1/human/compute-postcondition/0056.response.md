Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than or equal to 5, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 5, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1 + int((int(n / 4) - 3) / 4) + 1`, `countmins` is 4, `g` is `int(n / 5)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
