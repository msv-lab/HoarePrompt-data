To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(sqrt(x))`.

1. The loop iterates over the range starting from 1 up to and including `int(sqrt(x))`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(sqrt(x))` must be at least 1.
3. Given the constraints, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 10^8, so `sqrt(x)` will always be at least 1, ensuring `int(sqrt(x))` is at least 1.
4. Therefore, the loop will always execute at least once as long as `x` is within the given range.

Given this, the state of `i` should be set to 1, and `int(sqrt(x))` must be at least 1, which is guaranteed by the constraints on `x`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, `int(sqrt(x))` must be at least 1**
