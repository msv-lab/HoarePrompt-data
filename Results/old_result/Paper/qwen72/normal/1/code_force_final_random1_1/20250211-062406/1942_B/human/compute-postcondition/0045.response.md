To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `ar`.
2. **Range Function**: The `range` function is defined as `range(start, stop, step)`. In this case:
   - `start` is `len(ar) - 1`
   - `stop` is `-1`
   - `step` is `-1`

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the `start` value is greater than or equal to the `stop` value. This means `len(ar) - 1` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` should be set to the starting value of the range, which is `len(ar) - 1`.
   - `ar` must be a non-empty list for the loop to execute at least once.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` should be `len(ar) - 1`.
- `ar` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None`, `mex` is now equal to `n`, and `i` is `len(ar) - 1`**
