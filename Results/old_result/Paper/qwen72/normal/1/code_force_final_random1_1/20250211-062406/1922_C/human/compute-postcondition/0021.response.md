Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is equal to `t` and greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `d1`, and `d2` with their respective values and properties.
- The code snippet `d2[n - 1] = 1` updates the dictionary `d2` by setting the key `n - 1` to the value 1.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
- The updated state reflects the new value in `d2` while maintaining the rest of the initial conditions.
