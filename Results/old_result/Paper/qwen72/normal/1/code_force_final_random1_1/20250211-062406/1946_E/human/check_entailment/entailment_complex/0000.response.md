Reasoning:

1. **Precomputation of Factorials**: The program starts by precomputing factorials up to \(200,000\) and storing them in the list `facts`. This is necessary for efficiently computing combinations later in the program. The computation is done modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is a common practice to handle large numbers in combinatorial problems.

2. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation \(n\), the number of prefix maximums \(m_1\), and the number of suffix maximums \(m_2\). It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

3. **Initial Validation**: The program checks if the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum are the same, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is \(n\). If these conditions are not met, it prints 0, indicating that no valid permutation exists.

4. **Combination Calculation**: The program uses the precomputed factorials to calculate combinations using the `func_2` function. The combination formula is used to count the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements between the prefix and suffix maximums.

5. **Permutation Counting**: The program iterates over the suffix maximums and prefix maximums to calculate the number of valid permutations. It multiplies the results of the combination calculations and updates the answer accordingly.

6. **Modulo Operation**: All intermediate results and the final answer are taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure that the numbers remain manageable and to meet the problem's requirements.

7. **Function `func_1`**: This function is used to compute the modular inverse of a number. It is used within `func_2` to perform the combination calculation. The function handles edge cases and recursive calls correctly.

8. **Function `func_2`**: This function computes the combination using the precomputed factorials and the modular inverse computed by `func_1`. It ensures that the result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all edge cases and uses efficient algorithms to compute the required values.

Correctness: **True**
