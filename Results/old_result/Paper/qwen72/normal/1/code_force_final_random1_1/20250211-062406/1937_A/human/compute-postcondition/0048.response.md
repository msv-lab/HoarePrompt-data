The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. If `power` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 2, and `n` is log2(n_cases) where `n_cases` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must remain less than `n`. Since `power` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. Given that `n` is log2(n_cases) and `n_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is already greater than 0. However, to ensure the loop executes again, `n` must specifically be greater than 2.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is log2(n_cases) and must be greater than 2, `power` is 2**
