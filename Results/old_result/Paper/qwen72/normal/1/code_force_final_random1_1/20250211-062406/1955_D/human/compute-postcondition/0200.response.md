Postcondition: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` is `m-1`, `m` is the length of the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative. For each element `x` in `a` that is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[x]` is decremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a` up to the point where `cnt_b[x]` becomes negative. `n` remains an input integer, `k` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers read from the input, and `b` remains a list of integers read from the input. Additionally, the current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
