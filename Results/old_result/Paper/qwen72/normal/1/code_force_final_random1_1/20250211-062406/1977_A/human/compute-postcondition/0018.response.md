Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `n` is not equal to `m`.
- `m` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `m` is not equal to `n - 1`.
- Either `m` is not even or `n` is not even.
- Either `m` is even or `n` is even.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
