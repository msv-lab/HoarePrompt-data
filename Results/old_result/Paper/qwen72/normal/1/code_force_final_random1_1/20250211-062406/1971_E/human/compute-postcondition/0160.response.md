Output State: **`i` is `len(b)`, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input split by spaces, `len(b)` is greater than or equal to 1, `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is `[0, ad[i] / bd[i], ad[i] / bd[i]]`, `a` must have at least `len(b) + 1` elements.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `v` is `[0, ad[i] / bd[i]]`.
- The code appends `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`.
- After the execution, `v` now contains three elements: `[0, ad[i] / bd[i], ad[i] / bd[i]]`.
- All other variables (`i`, `b`, `len(b)`, `bd`, `a`) remain unchanged.
