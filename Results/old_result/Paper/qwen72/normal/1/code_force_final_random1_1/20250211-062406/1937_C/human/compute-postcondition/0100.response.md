Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is set to `n-1`.
- `best` is initialized to 0.
- `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', or 1 if no such `i` exists.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`n`**: This is a positive integer greater than 1.
2. **`i`**: This is `n-1`. For example, if `n = 5`, then `i = 4`.
3. **`best`**: This is always initialized to 0.
4. **`k`**: This is a bit more complex. It depends on the value of `res`:
   - If there is an `i` for which `res` was '<', then `k` is the last such `i`.
   - If no such `i` exists, then `k` is 1.

### Example Scenarios:
- If `n = 5` and `res` was '<' for `i = 3` but not for any other `i`, then `k` would be 3.
- If `n = 5` and `res` was never '<', then `k` would be 1.

### General Case:
- `k` will either be 1 (if no `i` made `res` '<') or the last `i` that made `res` '<'.
- `best` is always 0.
- `i` is always `n-1`.

### Output:
The print statement will output:
- A question mark (`?`).
- The value of `k`.
- The value of `best` (which is 0).
- The value of `k` again.
- The value of `i` (which is `n-1`).

### Final Output:
Output: **? [k] 0 [k] [n-1] (where k is the last value of i for which res was '<', or 1 if no such i exists, and n is the value of n)**
