The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it appears that the function should accept two parameters: `n` and `k`. These parameters are integers where `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9`. The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, so we cannot determine the exact return value without additional context. However, based on typical programming practices, we can infer that the function likely performs some operation involving `n` and `k` and returns a result based on these inputs.

Given the constraints and the lack of specific output details, the most accurate description of the function's functionality is:

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k` where `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9`. It performs an unspecified operation involving `n` and `k` and returns a result based on these inputs.**
