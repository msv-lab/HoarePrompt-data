Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1
- `A` is `a`
- `B` is `b`
- `C` is `c`

### Conditions:
1. If `b * 2 < c`, no changes are made.
2. If `b * 2 >= c` and `a` is even, no changes are made.
3. If `b * 2 >= c` and `a` is odd, `X` is set to `a // 2`.

### Analysis:
- We need to evaluate the conditions to see if any changes are made to the variables.
- The `print(A * B)` statement will print the product of `A` and `B`.

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:
1. **Condition 1**: `b * 2 < c`
   - If this condition is true, no changes are made. Therefore, `A` remains `a` and `B` remains `b`.
   - The print statement will output `a * b`.

2. **Condition 2**: `b * 2 >= c` and `a` is even
   - If this condition is true, no changes are made. Therefore, `A` remains `a` and `B` remains `b`.
   - The print statement will output `a * b`.

3. **Condition 3**: `b * 2 >= c` and `a` is odd
   - If this condition is true, `X` is set to `a // 2`. However, `X` is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
   - The print statement will still output `a * b`.

### Conclusion:
Regardless of the conditions, the values of `A` and `B` remain `a` and `b` respectively. Therefore, the print statement will always output the product of `a` and `b`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a * b (where a is the value of A and b is the value of B)**
