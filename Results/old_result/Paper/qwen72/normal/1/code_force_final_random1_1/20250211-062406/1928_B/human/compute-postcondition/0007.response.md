Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr` and the product of the last two elements of `arr`, `tem` is `arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`**. 

The value of `ans` has been updated to include the product of the last two elements of `arr`, while the other variables remain unchanged.
