Postcondition: **_ is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. Additionally, the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is greater than 1, and the value of `s` minus the difference between `b` and `a` plus 1 is greater than or equal to `i`.**
