The only variable in the loop head is `lst[tmp]`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `lst[tmp] != []`. For the loop to execute again, `lst[tmp]` must not be an empty list. At the end of the last iteration, `lst[tmp]` has one less element, so for the loop to execute one more time, `lst[tmp]` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists where each key `b` has a list containing all the corresponding `a` values that were read during the loop, and each key `a` has a list containing all the corresponding `b` values that were read during the loop; `x` is equal to the first integer from the input (which is `n`); `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`); `z` is an input integer; `one` is `True`; `lst[z]` has one less element; `tmp` is the last element removed from `lst[z]`; `lst[tmp]` has one less element; `lst[tmp]` must contain at least one element.**
