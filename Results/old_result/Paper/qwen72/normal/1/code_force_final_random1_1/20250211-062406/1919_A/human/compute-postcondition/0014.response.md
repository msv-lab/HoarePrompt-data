Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` and `b` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing `t` values, each value being the result of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration.**

Explanation:
- After all iterations of the loop, `t` will be 0 because the loop runs `t` times, decrementing `t` by 1 each time until it reaches 0.
- The values of `a` and `b` are provided by the user for each iteration, and they remain within the specified range (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).
- The `results` list will contain `t` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration of the loop.
