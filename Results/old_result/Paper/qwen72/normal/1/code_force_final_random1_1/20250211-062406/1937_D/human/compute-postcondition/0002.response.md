Output State: **s is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, A is an empty list, idx_A is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `idx_A` as an empty list. The other variables `s`, `n`, and `A` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial state with the addition of the new variable `idx_A` being an empty list.
