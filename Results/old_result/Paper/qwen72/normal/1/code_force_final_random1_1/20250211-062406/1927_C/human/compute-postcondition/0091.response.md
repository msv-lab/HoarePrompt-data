Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3. If `i` (which is 3) is in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1 and `bOnes` retains its previous value. Otherwise, `aOnes` retains its previous value and `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` (which is 3) is not in both `a` and `b`, and `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1 and `bOnes` retains its previous value. Otherwise, if `i` (which is 3) is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. If neither condition is met, `aOnes` and `bOnes` retain their previous values, and the program may break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
