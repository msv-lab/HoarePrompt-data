Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1, `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())`, `l` is a list of integers with all elements processed, `p` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative sum of elements in `l`, `c` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative count of `1`s encountered in `l`, `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`, and `j` is the total count of `1`s in `l`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- The variable `_` is still derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1.
- The variables `n` and `m` are still integers derived from `int(input().split())`.
- The list `l` has been fully processed, meaning all its elements have been used in the loop.
- The list `p` now contains elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative sum of elements in `l` at each step of the loop.
- The list `c` now contains elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative count of `1`s encountered in `l` at each step of the loop.
- The variable `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- The variable `j` is the total count of `1`s in `l`.
