Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the final print statement. It always prints 'Alice', regardless of the value of `dp`. This is because the condition in the print statement is always true due to the use of `or` instead of `and`.

The correct print statement should be:
```python
print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
```

Additionally, the logic for determining the winner seems to be flawed. The current logic does not correctly handle the game dynamics, particularly the condition for winning based on the parity of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted set of pile sizes.

A corrected version of the function might look like this:

```python
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True) + [0]
        dp = True
        for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
            dp = (arr[i] - arr[i + 1]) % 2 != 0 and dp
        print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
        tc -= 1
```

This version correctly checks the parity of the differences between consecutive elements and determines the winner based on whether the total number of such differences is odd or even.
