To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `tc` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings.
   - `i` is `n-1`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is 'NO'.
   - If `impossible` is `True`, then for all `i` from 0 to `n-2`, `gr[i][0] == gr[i + 1][0]` and `gr[i][m - 1] == gr[i + 1][m - 1]`.
   - If `impossible` is `False`, then `ans` remains 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.

Let's analyze the conditions step by step:

- **First Condition:** `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`
  - If the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, then `ans` is set to 'NO'.
  - If this condition is true, the `print(ans)` statement will output 'NO'.

- **Second Condition:** `impossible` is `True`
  - If `impossible` is `True`, it means that for all `i` from 0 to `n-2`, the first characters of consecutive strings are equal (`gr[i][0] == gr[i + 1][0]`) and the last characters of consecutive strings are equal (`gr[i][m - 1] == gr[i + 1][m - 1]`).
  - If `impossible` is `True`, the `print(ans)` statement will output 'NO' because the first condition would have already set `ans` to 'NO'.

- **Third Condition:** `impossible` is `False`
  - If `impossible` is `False`, then `ans` remains 'NO'.
  - This means that if the first condition did not set `ans` to 'NO', `ans` will still be 'NO' if `impossible` is `False`.

- **Otherwise:** `ans` remains 'YES'
  - If none of the above conditions are met, `ans` remains 'YES'.

Given these conditions, the only way `ans` can be 'YES' is if:
- `gr[0][0] == gr[n - 1][m - 1]` (first condition is false)
- `impossible` is `False`

However, if either of the first two conditions is true, `ans` will be 'NO'.

Therefore, the final output will be:
Output: **ans (where ans is 'NO' if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1] or impossible is True, otherwise ans is 'YES')**
