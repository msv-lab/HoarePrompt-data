Output State: **`delta` is the minimum of the original `rest` and the value at `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. `rest` is now `k - 3*delta`. The element at `sorted_indices[pos]` in `a` is reduced by `delta`. `distance` is incremented by 1. The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged. `rest` must be non-zero (i.e., `k` must be greater than `3*delta`), and `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices) - 1`.** 

Explanation:
- The value at `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`.
- The values of `delta`, `rest`, `distance`, and the conditions for `rest` and `pos` remain as specified in the initial state.
- The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` are not affected by this operation.
