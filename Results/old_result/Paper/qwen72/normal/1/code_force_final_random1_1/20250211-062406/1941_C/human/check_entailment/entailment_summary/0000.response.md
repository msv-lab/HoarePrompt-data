Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and outputs their sum. However, the problem requires finding the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" appears as a substring in the string `s`.

The current implementation only counts how many times "map" and "pie" appear as whole substrings, but it does not account for overlapping occurrences or partial matches that could still form "map" or "pie" after some deletions. For example, in the string "mmapnapie", the program would count one "map" and one "pie", but the correct answer should be 2 deletions to remove the overlapping parts.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the positions of "map" and "pie" and calculate the minimum number of deletions required to break these substrings. This involves more complex logic than simply counting the substrings.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
