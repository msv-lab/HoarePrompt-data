Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (but will be decremented by 1), `_` is a throwaway variable, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the input.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to be the integer input provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `_`, and `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` and retains the initial conditions for the other variables.
