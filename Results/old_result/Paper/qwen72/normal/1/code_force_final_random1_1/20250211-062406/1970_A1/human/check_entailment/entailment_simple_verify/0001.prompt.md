You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if infoA.balance != infoB.balance:
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
    return infoB.position - infoA.position

#Function 2:
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join((info.character for info in balance_info))
    print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
class BalanceInfo:

    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character
if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = input().strip()
    func_2(s)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and `position` is a positive integer representing the position of the character in the input sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance of `infoA` and the balance of `infoB`. Since the balance of `infoA` is not equal to the balance of `infoB`, the returned value will be a non-zero integer.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and `position` is a positive integer representing the position of the character in the input sequence. Additionally, `infoA.balance` is equal to `infoB.balance`.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between `infoB.position` and `infoA.position`, which is a positive integer representing the distance between the positions of the characters in the input sequence.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. `n` is the length of `s` and remains unchanged. `balance_info` is a list containing `n` elements, where each element is a `BalanceInfo` object. Each `BalanceInfo` object in the list corresponds to an index `i` in the string `s`, with `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. For each `BalanceInfo` object, `i` is the index in the string, `s[i]` is the character at that index, and `balance` is the cumulative balance of parentheses up to that index. The final value of `balance` will be 0 because `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: a valid balanced parentheses sequence (rearranged version of the original string `s`)




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
1. The function `func_1` is not used in the provided code, so we will focus on `func_2`.
2. `func_2` takes a string `s` as input, which is a balanced parentheses sequence.
3. It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store information about each character in the input string.
4. It iterates over the string `s`, maintaining a running balance of parentheses. For each character, it appends a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info` containing the current balance, the position of the character, and the character itself.
5. After the loop, it sorts the `balance_info` list based on the balance (in ascending order) and, in case of ties, by the position (in descending order).
6. Finally, it constructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list and prints it.

The logic implemented in `func_2` correctly follows the steps described in the problem statement for performing the balanced shuffle operation. The sorting criteria ensure that the sequence is shuffled according to the specified rules.

Therefore, the program is correct.
