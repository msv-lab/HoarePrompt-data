The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, it already satisfies this condition. However, for the loop to start, `i` should be initialized to 0 (the starting point of `range(t)`).

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0**
