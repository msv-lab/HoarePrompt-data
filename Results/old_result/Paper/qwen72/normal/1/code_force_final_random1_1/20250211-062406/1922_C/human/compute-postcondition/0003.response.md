Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is equal to `t` and greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default factory `int`.** 

The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `d1` with the default factory set to `int`. This means that `d1` will automatically initialize any new key with the integer value 0. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.
