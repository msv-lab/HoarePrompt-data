The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the variable `nx`. Since the initial state does not specify what `nx` is, we assume `nx` is a string. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus the character 'F'.**
