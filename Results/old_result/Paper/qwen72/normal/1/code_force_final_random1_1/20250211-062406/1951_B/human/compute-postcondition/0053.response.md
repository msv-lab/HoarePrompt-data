Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where the elements at indices `p` and `k-1` have been swapped, `h` is equal to the first element of `s` (which is now the original first element), `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that was compared with `h` before the loop broke or completed, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` starting from the second element up to the point where `h` is no longer greater than or equal to the current element `i` in the loop, `p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the second element of `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `z` is 1 and `ans1` is incremented by 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, and `z` is 1, then `ans1` is incremented by 1 and `z` remains 1. Otherwise, `ans1` remains 0 and `z` remains 0.**
