Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Conditions**: The conditions `if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2` and `b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2` do not correctly capture the necessary conditions for determining if the array can be made zero. These conditions are too restrictive and do not consider the overall sum and parity of the array elements.

2. **Sum and Parity Consideration**: To determine if the array can be made zero, you need to check if the sum of the array elements is even and if the array can be reduced to zero by the given operations. Specifically, the sum of the array must be even because each operation reduces the sum by 4 (which is even).

3. **General Solution Approach**: A correct approach would involve checking if the sum of the array is even and then verifying if the array can be reduced to zero by the given operations. This typically involves checking the cumulative sum and ensuring that no intermediate step results in a negative value.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the sum of the array is even
        if sum(a) % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if the array can be reduced to zero
        prefix_sum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            prefix_sum += a[i]
            if prefix_sum < 0 or (prefix_sum % 2 != 0):
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected solution checks if the sum of the array is even and then ensures that the cumulative sum remains non-negative and even throughout the process. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
