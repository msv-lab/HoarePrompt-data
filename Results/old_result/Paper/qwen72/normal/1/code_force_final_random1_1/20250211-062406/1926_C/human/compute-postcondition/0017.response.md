The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the string representation of `i`. The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `N` (which is 200001), and `j` is the last digit of `N` (which is '1'). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be the next digit in the string representation of `i`.

Since `i` is 200001, the string representation of `i` is "200001". The digits in this string are '2', '0', '0', '0', '0', and '1'. After the last iteration, `j` was '1'. For the next iteration, `j` should be the next digit in the sequence, which would be the digit before '1' in the string "200001". However, since we are iterating from the end to the beginning, the next digit is actually the first digit of the string, which is '2'.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `j` is now '2', and the loop will continue as long as there are more characters in the string representation of `i`.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of length 200001 with `pd[0]` set to 0, `pd[i]` (where `i` is `N`) is now the sum of `pd[N-1]` and the sum of the digits of `N` plus the integer value of `j`, `i` is `N`, `j` is '2'**
