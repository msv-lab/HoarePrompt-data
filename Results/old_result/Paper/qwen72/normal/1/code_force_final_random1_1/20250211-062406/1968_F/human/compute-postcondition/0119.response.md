Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - (n + 2) * q - 1]` and must be at least 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - (n + 2) * q - 2]` and must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2) + n + 3`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is `int(data[idx - (n + 2) * q - n + i - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is the cumulative XOR of elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to the unique values in `pf` and their respective indices as values, `results` contains the final results of the loop's operations ('YES' or 'NO' for each iteration), with the last element being an empty string, `i` is `n`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.** 

Explanation: The code `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]` calculates the XOR of the elements `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` and assigns the result to the variable `x`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is now the result of the XOR operation between `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`.
