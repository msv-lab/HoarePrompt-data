Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input.
- `i` is equal to `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
- Either `(b - a + 1) <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition 1**: `(b - a + 1) <= 1`
   - This means that the range between `a` and `b` is either 0 or 1. If `a` and `b` are the same, then the range is 1. If `a` is greater than `b`, the range is 0.
   
2. **Condition 2**: `s - (b - a + 1) < i`
   - This condition checks if the difference between `s` and the length of the range `(b - a + 1)` is less than `i`.

### Conclusion:
- The `print('NO')` statement will always execute because the initial state guarantees that one of the two conditions is true:
  - Either the range between `a` and `b` is very small (0 or 1), or the difference between `s` and the length of the range is less than `i`.

Therefore, the output will always be:

Output: **NO**
