The code snippet `points[team] += 1` increments the value of `points[team]` by 1. The value of `team` is determined by the function `goalIn(pos)`, which is called with the current position `pos`. Since `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, the specific team being updated depends on the result of this function. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `time` is 1, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `elements`, `mov`, `grid`, and `player` remain unchanged, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, and `points[team]` is incremented by 1.**
