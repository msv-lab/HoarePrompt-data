The code `b.append(a[r])` appends the element at index `r` of the list `a` to the list `b`.

- Initially, `b` contains either the first element of `a` if `s[0]` is 'L' or the last element of `a` if `s[0]` is 'R'.
- The value of `r` is `n - 1` if `s[0]` is 'L' or `n - 2` if `s[0]` is 'R'.

After executing the code:

- If `s[0]` is 'L':
  - `b` now contains the first element of `a` (since `b` initially contained the first element) and the second-to-last element of `a` (since `r` is `n - 2`).
- If `s[0]` is 'R':
  - `b` now contains the last element of `a` (since `b` initially contained the last element) and the second-to-last element of `a` (since `r` is `n - 2`).

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing either the first element of `a` and the second-to-last element of `a` if `s[0]` is 'L', or the last element of `a` and the second-to-last element of `a` if `s[0]` is 'R', `l` is 1 if `s[0]` is 'L' or remains 0 if `s[0]` is 'R', `r` is `n - 1` if `s[0]` is 'L' or `n - 2` if `s[0]` is 'R', and `i` is 1.**
