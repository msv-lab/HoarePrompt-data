### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the program, we need to carefully analyze the logic implemented in `func_1` and how it relates to the problem description.

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - Each player must remove one coin from their wallet on their turn.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., whose wallet has 0 coins) loses.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The game is essentially about the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins.
   - If the total number of coins is even, the second player (Bob) will always have a move after the first player (Alice).
   - If the total number of coins is odd, the first player (Alice) will always have the last move.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` checks if the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even.
   - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
   - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b`, calls `func_1(a, b)`, and stores the result.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result.

5. **Validation**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct because it correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results as expected.

6. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases in the problem description align with the logic implemented in `func_1`:
     - For `(1, 1)`, the sum is 2 (even), so Bob wins.
     - For `(1, 4)`, the sum is 5 (odd), so Alice wins.
     - For `(5, 3)`, the sum is 8 (even), so Bob wins.
     - For `(4, 5)`, the sum is 9 (odd), so Alice wins.
     - And so on...

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner of the game based on the parity of the total number of coins. The provided test cases and the function summaries support this conclusion.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
