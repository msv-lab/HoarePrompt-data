Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` remain integers read from input and satisfy the conditions 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both `n` and `m` are odd. `grid` is now a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the updated `line`. `elements` is a dictionary that contains entries for each unique non-'..' string in `line`, with the key being the string and the value being a tuple (0, index) where index is the position of the string in `line`. `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains entries for each player string (as determined by the `isPlayer` function) found in `line`, with the key being the player string and the value being `False`. `goal` is a list containing two lists: the first list contains tuples (0, index) for each string in `line` that ends with 'G' and starts with 'B', and the second list contains tuples (0, index) for each string in `line` that ends with 'G' and starts with 'R'. `points` remains a list `[0, 0]`. `i` is 0. `line` is updated to a list of strings read from the input, and its length is the same as the number of iterations the loop executed.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` and `m` remain integers read from input and satisfy the conditions 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both `n` and `m` are odd. `grid` is now a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the updated `line`. `elements` is a dictionary that contains entries for each unique non-'..' string in `line`. `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains entries for each player string (as determined by the `isPlayer` function) found in `line`. `goal` is a list containing two lists: the first list contains tuples (0, index) for each string in `line` that ends with 'G' and starts with 'B', and the second list contains tuples (0, index) for each string in `line` that ends with 'G' and starts with 'R'. If `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements` includes the new entry for `line[ind]` which is `(i, ind)`. If `line[ind]` is a player string, the value for `line[ind]` is now `False`. If `line[ind]` is not a player string and ends with 'G', the second list of `goal` now includes the tuple (0, ind), and `tmp` is 1. `points` remains a list `[0, 0]`, `i` is 0, `line` is updated to a list of strings read from the input and must have at least one element, `ind` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` and `m` remain integers read from input and satisfy the conditions 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both `n` and `m` are odd. `grid` is now a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the updated `line`. `elements` is a dictionary that contains entries for each unique non-'..' string in `line`. `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains entries for each player string (as determined by the `isPlayer` function) found in `line`. `goal` is a list containing two lists: the first list contains tuples (0, index) for each string in `line` that ends with 'G' and starts with 'B', and the second list contains tuples (0, index) for each string in `line` that ends with 'G' and starts with 'R'. `points` remains a list `[0, 0]`, `i` is 0, `line` is updated to a list of strings read from the input and must have at least one element, `ind` is 1. If `line[1]` is not '..', `elements` now includes the entry for `line[1]` which is `(0, 1)`. If `line[1]` is a player string, the value for `line[1]` in `allPlayers` is now `False`. If `line[1]` is not a player string and ends with 'G', the second list of `goal` now includes the tuple (0, 1). If `line[1]` ends with 'G', the tuple (0, 1) is appended to `goal[tmp]`, where `tmp` is 0 if `line[1]` starts with 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. If `line[1]` is '..', none of these updates occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` and `m` remain integers read from input and satisfy the conditions 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both `n` and `m` are odd. `grid` is a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the updated `line`. `elements` is a dictionary that contains entries for each unique non-'..' string in `line`. `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains entries for each player string found in `line`. `goal` is a list containing two lists: the first list contains tuples (0, index) for each string in `line` that ends with 'G' and starts with 'B', and the second list contains tuples (0, index) for each string in `line` that ends with 'G' and starts with 'R'. `points` remains a list `[0, 0]`, `i` is 0, `line` is updated to a list of strings read from the input and must have at least two elements, `ind` is 2. If `line[2]` is not '..', `elements` now includes the entry for `line[2]` which is `(0, 2)`. If `line[2]` is a player string, the value for `line[2]` in `allPlayers` is now `False`. If `line[2]` ends with 'G', the tuple `(0, 2)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`, where `tmp` is 0 if `line[2]` starts with 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. If `line[2]` is '..', none of these updates occur.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
