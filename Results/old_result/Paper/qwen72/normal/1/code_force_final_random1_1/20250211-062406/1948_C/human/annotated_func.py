#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an even integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of columns in the grid. The grid consists of two rows, and each row is represented by a string of length n containing only the characters '<' and '>', indicating the direction of the arrows in each cell. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is the last integer input by the user, `a` is the last string input by the user, `b` is the last string input by the user, and `i` is the last odd number less than `n`. The loop has completed all iterations for all `t` test cases. For each test case, if the loop did not break due to the condition `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program will print 'yes'. If the loop broke due to the condition being met, the program printed 'No' and moved on to the next test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. It checks if it's possible to move from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a 2-row grid, where each cell contains an arrow pointing left ('<') or right ('>'). The function prints 'No' if it finds any conflicting arrows that prevent such a path, and 'Yes' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the printed results for each test case.
