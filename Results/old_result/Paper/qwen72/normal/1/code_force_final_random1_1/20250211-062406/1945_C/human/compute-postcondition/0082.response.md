Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the new `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in the new `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in the new `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` is an empty list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` that have the minimum absolute difference with `pk`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n` if the length of `final` is 0, `c1` is greater than or equal to 50 if the length of `final` is 1 and `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `c1` is less than 50 if the length of `final` is 1 and `c1` is less than 50, and `t` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `lst = []` reassigns `lst` to an empty list, overriding its previous value.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `t` is decremented by 1, but it remains greater than 0.
- The conditions and calculations involving `c1` and `final` remain the same, as they depend on the length of `lst` which is now 0.
