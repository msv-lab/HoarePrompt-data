The function `func_6` takes a list of lists `arr`, a non-negative integer `index`, and an integer `value`. It searches through each sublist in `arr` to find the first sublist where the element at position `index` is equal to `value`. If such a sublist is found, it is returned. If no sublist meets this condition, the function returns `None`. After the function concludes, `arr`, `index`, and `value` remain unchanged, and the function either returns a matching sublist or `None`.
