Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `m` is the input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is `m-2`. If any pair of consecutive characters in the first string of `gr` or the last string of `gr` are not equal, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `j = 0` to `j = m-2` (inclusive), which means it runs `m-1` times.
- After all iterations, `j` will be `m-2`.
- The condition inside the loop checks if any pair of consecutive characters in the first string (`gr[0]`) or the last string (`gr[n-1]`) are not equal. If any such pair is found, `impossible` is set to `False`.
- If no such pair is found throughout all iterations, `impossible` remains `True`.
- All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `gr`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
