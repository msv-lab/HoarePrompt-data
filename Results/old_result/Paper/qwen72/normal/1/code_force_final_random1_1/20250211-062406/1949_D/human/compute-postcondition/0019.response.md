The code snippet `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[1]` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `b[1]` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `x`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, `j` is 2, `b[1]` is incremented by 1.**
