Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of non-zero integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second, `n` is the number of monsters (equal to the length of `a` and `x`), `sorted_indices` is a list of indices from 0 to n-1 sorted based on the absolute values of the elements in `x`, `distance` is 0, `pos` is 0, `rest` is `k`, and the absolute value of the element at the index `sorted_indices[pos]` in `x` is not equal to `distance`.
Code of the loop:
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
    delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
    rest -= delta
    a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
    if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
        pos += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of non-zero integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second, `n` is the number of monsters (equal to the length of `a` and `x`), `sorted_indices` is a list of indices from 0 to n-1 sorted based on the absolute values of the elements in `x`, `distance` is 0, `rest` is `k - delta`, `delta` is the minimum of `k` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, `pos` is incremented by 1 and `delta` is now the minimum of `k` and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`. Otherwise, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta` and `pos` remains unchanged. The absolute value of the element at the index `sorted_indices[pos]` in `x` is not equal to `distance`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and the original value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` depending on whether `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and the original value of `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is now `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]] - delta`, `pos` is incremented by 1, and `rest` is updated to `rest - delta`. Otherwise, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`, and `rest` is updated to `rest - delta`. In both cases, `a` is a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of non-zero integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second, `n` is the number of monsters (equal to the length of `a` and `x`), `sorted_indices` is a list of indices from 0 to n-1 sorted based on the absolute values of the elements in `x`, `distance` is 0, and `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and the original value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` becomes 0, `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and the original value of `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is reduced by `delta`, `pos` is incremented by 1, and `rest` is reduced by `delta`. `a` is a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of non-zero integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second, `n` is the number of monsters (equal to the length of `a` and `x`), `sorted_indices` is a list of indices from 0 to n-1 sorted based on the absolute values of the elements in `x`, and `distance` is 0.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
