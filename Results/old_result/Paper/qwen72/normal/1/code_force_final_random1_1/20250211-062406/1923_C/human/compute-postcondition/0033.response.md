To determine what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1.
   - `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list of integers with all elements processed.
   - `p` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative sum of elements in `l`.
   - `c` is a list containing elements starting with `[0]` followed by the cumulative count of `1`s encountered in `l`.
   - `i` is the count of `1`s in the sublist `l[a:b+1]`.
   - `j` is the total count of `1`s in `l`.
   - `a` and `b` are integers derived from `int(input().split())` where `b` must be greater than 0.
   - `s` is the sum of elements in the sublist `l[a:b+1]`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - The length of the sublist `l[a:b+1]` is greater than 1.
   - The difference between the sum of elements in the sublist `l[a:b+1]` and the length of the sublist `l[a:b+1]` is greater than or equal to the count of `1`s in the sublist `l[a:b+1]`.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will execute if all the conditions are met. Since the conditions are explicitly stated and assumed to be true based on the initial state, the `print` statement will always print 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
