Output State: **_ is incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `a` are updated to the values from the tuple `test_cases[_]`, `a` is a non-empty iterable with no elements remaining, `freq` is a list where each element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by the number of occurrences of the corresponding character in `a`, `missing` is the sum of the differences `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, `results` now includes the value of `missing` as its last element, `prob` is the last element of `a`.**

Explanation:
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `n`, `m`, and `a` are updated to the values from the tuple `test_cases[_]`.
- The state of `a` being a non-empty iterable with no elements remaining remains unchanged.
- The state of `freq` being a list where each element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by the number of occurrences of the corresponding character in `a` remains unchanged.
- The state of `missing` being the sum of the differences `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq` remains unchanged.
- The state of `results` now including the value of `missing` as its last element remains unchanged.
- The state of `prob` being the last element of `a` remains unchanged.
