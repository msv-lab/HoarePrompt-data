Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `cur` is 0.
- `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met.
- `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that were added when `cur` was reset to 0 plus the current value of `tmp` followed by `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times.
- `tmp` is the character corresponding to `chr(ord('a') + (k-1))` if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains as it was (either an empty string or the character corresponding to `chr(ord('a') + i)`).
- `cnt` is less than `n`.
- `i` is `k-1`.
- `k` must be greater than or equal to `k` (this is always true and doesn't provide new information).

### Analysis:
1. **`cur` is 0**: This means that the initial value of `cur` is 0.
2. **`cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met**: This condition checks if `cur` has reached the maximum value it can hold with `k` bits set to 1. For example, if `k = 3`, then `cur == 7` (binary `111`).
3. **`ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that were added when `cur` was reset to 0 plus the current value of `tmp` followed by `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times**:
   - When `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1`, it is reset to 0, and characters from `s` are added to `ans`.
   - After adding these characters, the current value of `tmp` is appended to `ans`.
   - Finally, `'a'` is repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times and appended to `ans`.

4. **`tmp` is the character corresponding to `chr(ord('a') + (k-1))` if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains as it was**:
   - If the bit at position `i` (which is `k-1`) in `cur` is 0, `tmp` is set to the character corresponding to `chr(ord('a') + (k-1))`.
   - If the bit at position `i` is 1, `tmp` remains unchanged.

5. **`cnt` is less than `n`**: This ensures that the process continues until `cnt` reaches `n`.

6. **`i` is `k-1`**: This specifies the bit position being checked in `cur`.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `cur` is 0 initially, the bit at position `i` (which is `k-1`) in `cur` is 0.
- Therefore, `tmp` is set to the character corresponding to `chr(ord('a') + (k-1))`.
- The string `ans` will contain the characters from `s` that were added when `cur` was reset to 0, plus the current value of `tmp`, followed by `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times.

Given the initial state, the exact value of `s` and `n` are not provided, but we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

### Final Output:
Output: **[characters from s added when cur was reset to 0] + chr(ord('a') + (k-1)) + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)**

This output describes the string `ans` which contains the characters from `s` added when `cur` was reset to 0, followed by the character corresponding to `chr(ord('a') + (k-1))`, and then `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times.
