The function `bfs` accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`. Both `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in a tree, with the constraint that 1 <= start, target <= n. The tree is represented as a dictionary where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring node indices.

- **Case_1**: The function returns 0.
- **Case_2**: The function returns the distance (`dist`) from the `start` node to the current node (`current`). This distance is the second element of the tuple that was at the front of the `queue` before it was removed.
- **Case_3**: The function returns the distance (`dist`) from the `start` node to the `current` node, which is the node that was recently removed from the front of the queue.
- **Case_4**: The function returns -1, indicating that the target node was not found in the graph starting from the start node.

Functionality: **The function `bfs` accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, both integers representing nodes in a tree. It returns 0 if the start node is the same as the target node. If the target node is found, it returns the distance from the start node to the target node. If the target node is not found, it returns -1.**
