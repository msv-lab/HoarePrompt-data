The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 (since the loop runs from 0 to `n-2`). The variable `i` should start at 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 1, `m` is the input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is 0, `ans` is 'NO' if `impossible` is `True`. The first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is `m-2`. `impossible` is `True`.**
