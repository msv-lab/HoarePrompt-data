The value of `i` is appended to the list `p`. Initially, `p` contains a single element `[0]`. After appending `i`, `p` will contain two elements: `[0, i]`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `c`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is derived from `int(input())` and must be at least 1, `n` and `m` are integers derived from `int(input().split())`, `l` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `p` is a list containing elements `[0, i]`, `c` is a list containing a single element `[0]`, `i` is 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `i` is 0, and `j` is 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 0.**
