The function `func_7` reads an integer `n` from the user, indicating the number of operations to perform. It then processes `n` lines of input, each containing two integers `t` and `v`. Based on the value of `t`, the function updates the `start` and `end` values or appends `v` to the list `num`. After processing all inputs, the function calculates the number of elements in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive). If `start` is greater than `end`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the count of elements in `num` that fall within the range, ensuring the result is non-negative.
