Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer and must be greater than or equal to 5, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `count` is 4, `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1 + int((int(n / 3) - 2) / 3) + 1`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `int(n / 3) - 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `countmins` is updated to `int(count - 1)`, which is `int(4 - 1)` resulting in `3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
