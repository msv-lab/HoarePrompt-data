Reasoning:  
To evaluate the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure that it accurately determines the winner of the game based on the rules and the optimal play strategy. The key insight here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets. This is because:

- If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, the game will always end in a situation where the last player to move (Bob, since Alice starts) will be the one to face an empty wallet, thus losing the game.
- If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, the game will end with the first player (Alice) facing an empty wallet, thus losing the game.

The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements this logic by checking if `(a + b) % 2 == 0`. If true, it returns 'Bob', indicating that Bob wins. Otherwise, it returns 'Alice', indicating that Alice wins.

The function `func_2()` handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases, processes each case by calling `func_1(a, b)`, and collects the results. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the problem's constraints and the logic implemented in the functions, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
