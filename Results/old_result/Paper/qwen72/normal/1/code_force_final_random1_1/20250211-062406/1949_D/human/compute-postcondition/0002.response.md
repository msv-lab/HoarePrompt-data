Output State: **n is an integer input by the user such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line represents the transition video between the i-th and j-th scenarios, and can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (i = j, no transition). At most ⌊n/2⌋ transition videos are already decided, and the matrix is symmetric. `a` is a list of length n + 1, initialized with all elements set to 0. `b` is a list of length n + 1, initialized with all elements set to 0.**
