Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the approach used in the loop to calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) does not accurately reflect the conditions specified in the problem statement. The condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not properly checked in the code.

A more accurate approach would involve iterating through possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition directly. However, this brute-force approach would be too slow given the constraints. A more efficient algorithm is needed, which typically involves number theory concepts such as the properties of the greatest common divisor (gcd).

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This solution iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly. However, this approach is inefficient and will not pass the time limits for large inputs. A more optimized approach is needed, which might involve precomputing certain values or using mathematical insights to reduce the complexity.
