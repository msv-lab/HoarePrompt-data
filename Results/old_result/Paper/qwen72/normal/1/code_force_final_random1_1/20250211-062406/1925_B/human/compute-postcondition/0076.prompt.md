Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` and `n` are updated to the values provided by the input, `q` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`, `ans` is 1, and the loop will execute again if `q` is less than `int(input())`. The value of `t` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    if x % i == 0:
        if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
            ans = max(ans, i)
        if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //
            i) == 0:
            ans = max(ans, x // i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `n` is updated to the value provided by the input, `q` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`, and the value of `t` remains unchanged. If `x % i == 0` and `(x - n * (x // i))` is non-negative, divisible by `(x // i)`, and `x // i` is greater than 0, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value (1) and `x`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `n` is updated to the value provided by the input, `q` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`, and `t` remains unchanged. If `x % i == 0` and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum value between the original `ans` and `x // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `x` remains at least 1, `n` is updated to the value provided by the input, `q` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`, and `t` remains unchanged. If `x % i == 0` and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the previous `ans` and `x // 3`. If `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, then `ans` is further updated to the maximum of the current `ans` and 3. The loop will execute again if `3 < int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. If `x % i != 0`, `ans` remains unchanged and the loop will continue to check the condition for the next iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
