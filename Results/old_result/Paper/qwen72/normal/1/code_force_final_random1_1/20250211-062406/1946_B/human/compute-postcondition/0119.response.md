Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that index, `smin` is a list containing the single element 0, and the current value of `suf[i + 1]` is less than the current value of `smin[i]`.**
