Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least one element, `res` is a list of `None` with length `n` except for the last element which is `mex - ar[-1]`, `mex` is `n`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` updates the last element of the list `res` (since `i` is `len(ar) - 1`) to be the value of `mex - ar[i]`.
- Since `mex` is `n` and `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, the last element of `res` is set to `n - ar[-1]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
