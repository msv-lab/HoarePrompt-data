Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, `test` is the third element of `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing two elements where both elements are `current_year`, `n` is the first item of the third element of `test_cases`, `a` is the second item of the third element of `test_cases` and must be a non-empty iterable, `current_year` is 0. If `current_year` is divisible by the first item (`ai`) of the iterable `a`, `next_year` is set to `ai`. Otherwise, `current_year % ai` is not equal to 0, and `next_year` is set to `ai`.***
