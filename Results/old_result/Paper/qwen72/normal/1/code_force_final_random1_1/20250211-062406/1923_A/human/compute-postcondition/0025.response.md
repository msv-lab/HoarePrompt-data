The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`.

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, representing the number of cells.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing whether a cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1), and at least one cell contains a chip.

The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the configuration of the cells in `a` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (an integer representing the number of cells), and `a` (a list of integers representing the state of each cell). The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the configuration of the cells in `a` for each test case.**
