Reasoning:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The initialization of the DP array `dp` is correct. The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are appropriate for the problem, as they represent the number of valid configurations for a 1x1 and 2x2 grid, respectively.

2. **DP Transition**: The transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is mathematically sound. It correctly accounts for the two scenarios:
   - Placing a rook in the i-th row and i-th column, which leaves `dp[i-1]` configurations for the remaining (i-1)x(i-1) grid.
   - Placing a rook in the i-th row and any of the (i-1) columns, and then placing a rook in the corresponding column and any of the (i-1) rows, which leaves `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]` configurations for the remaining (i-2)x(i-2) grid.

3. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.

4. **Invalid Positions**: The set `invalid` is used to keep track of the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks due to the initial moves. This ensures that these positions are not considered for further placements. The use of a set is efficient and appropriate for this purpose.

5. **Final Configuration Calculation**: The number of valid configurations for the remaining rows and columns (after accounting for the initial moves) is calculated using `dp[n - len(invalid)]`. This is correct because the DP array `dp` stores the number of valid configurations for a given number of rows (or columns).

6. **Edge Case Handling**: The `max(1, ...)` ensures that if there are no remaining rows or columns to place rooks, the result is 1 (since an empty board is also a valid configuration).

7. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` precomputes the DP values up to `n = 300000`, which is necessary because the maximum value of `n` can be up to 300000. This precomputation is done once and reused for all test cases, which is efficient.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
