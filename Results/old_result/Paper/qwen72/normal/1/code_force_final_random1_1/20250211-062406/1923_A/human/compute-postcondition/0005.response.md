The code snippet `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` reverses the string `arr` and finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string. This index is then assigned to the variable `y`. The index `y` represents the position from the end of the original string `arr`.

- If '1' is found in `arr`, `y` will be the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the original string `arr` (counting from the end).
- If '1' is not found in `arr`, `y` will be `-1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in `arr`, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in `arr`.**
