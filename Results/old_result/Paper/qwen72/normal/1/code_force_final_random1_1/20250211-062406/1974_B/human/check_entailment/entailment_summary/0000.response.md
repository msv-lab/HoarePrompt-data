Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to decode an encoded string according to the specified algorithm. However, there are several issues with the implementation of `func_1` that prevent it from correctly performing the decoding:

1. **Modification of `s` During Iteration**: The function modifies the string `s` while iterating over it, which can lead to unexpected behavior. Specifically, the line `s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])` changes the string `s` in place, which can cause the loop to behave incorrectly, especially if the same character appears multiple times.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Decoding**: The logic for replacing characters in the string `s` is flawed. The function should replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the reversed unique characters list. Instead, the function attempts to modify the string `s` directly and also manipulates the `unique_chars` list in a way that does not align with the decoding process.

3. **Handling of Non-Unique Characters**: The function incorrectly handles characters that are not in the `unique_chars` list by inserting them into the list. This is not part of the decoding process and leads to incorrect results.

To correctly decode the string, the function should:
- Construct the unique characters list `r` from the encoded string.
- Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart.
- Use this mapping to decode the string.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    # Step 1: Construct the unique characters list in sorted order
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    
    # Step 2: Create a mapping from each character in unique_chars to its symmetric counterpart
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    
    # Step 3: Decode the string using the mapping
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    
    return decoded_str

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        encoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(encoded_str)
```

Given the issues in the original implementation, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
