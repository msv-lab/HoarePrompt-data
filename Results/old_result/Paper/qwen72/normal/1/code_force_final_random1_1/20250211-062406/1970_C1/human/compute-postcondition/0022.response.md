The code `tmp = lst[tmp].pop()` removes the last element from the list `lst[tmp]` and assigns this value to `tmp`.

- `rev` remains unchanged as a `defaultdict` of lists where each key `b` has a list containing all the corresponding `a` values that were read during the loop, and each key `a` has a list containing all the corresponding `b` values that were read during the loop.
- `x` remains equal to the first integer from the input (which is `n`).
- `y` remains the second integer from the input (which is `t`).
- `z` remains an input integer.
- `one` remains `False`.
- `lst[z]` must not be an empty list, and since `tmp` was initially equal to `z`, `lst[z]` now has one less element.
- `tmp` is now equal to the last element that was removed from `lst[z]`.

Output State: **`rev` is a `defaultdict` of lists where each key `b` has a list containing all the corresponding `a` values that were read during the loop, and each key `a` has a list containing all the corresponding `b` values that were read during the loop; `x` is equal to the first integer from the input (which is `n`); `y` is the second integer from the input (which is `t`); `z` is an input integer; `one` is `False`; `lst[z]` has one less element; `tmp` is the last element removed from `lst[z]`.**
