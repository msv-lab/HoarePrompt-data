The code appends the tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `c1` is calculated as `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1` and `i` is 3, the tuple being appended is `((len(path_ba) / 2) - 1, 3)`. Since `ops` already contains the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, after appending, `ops` will contain three tuples: `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, and `((len(path_ba) / 2) - 1, 3)`. The values of `path_ba`, `i`, `c1`, and `c2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path_ba` has a length greater than 4, `i` is 3, `c1` is `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`, `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, and `((len(path_ba) / 2) - 1, 3)`**
