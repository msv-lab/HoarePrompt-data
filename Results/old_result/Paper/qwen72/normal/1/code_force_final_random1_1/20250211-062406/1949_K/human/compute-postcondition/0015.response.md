Functionality: ** The function `func_2` takes five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. It sorts the `numbers` list in descending order and then distributes the elements into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`) based on a distribution logic defined by the `distribute_number` function. After distributing the numbers, it checks if the sums of the elements in these groups (`sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c`) satisfy a condition defined by `func_1`. If the condition is met, the function returns 'YES' along with the three groups. If the condition is not met, it returns 'NO'. The original `numbers` list is emptied during the process. **
