To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

Initial State:
- `j` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is `n - 2`
- If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`, `idx_B` is a list containing `[i]`. If `idx_B` was initially empty, `B` is a list containing `[0]`. Otherwise, if `idx_B` is not empty, `x` is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1)) * len(idx_B)`, and `B` is a list with one additional element `x` appended to it.
- If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is not `<`, there are no changes to `idx_B` or `B`.

Given Code Snippet:
```python
x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
```

Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Check the initial conditions:**
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `idx_B` contains `[i]` if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`
   - `B` is `[0]` if `idx_B` was initially empty, otherwise `B` is updated with the value of `x` as described.

2. **Evaluate the code snippet:**
   - The code snippet calculates a new value for `x` using the formula `x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`
   - Since `i` is `n - 2`, and `idx_B` contains `[i]` if the character at index `i` in the string `s` is `<`, we can assume `idx_B` contains `[n - 2]`.
   - `B` is a list containing `[0]` if `idx_B` was initially empty, or it contains more elements if `idx_B` was not empty.

3. **Calculate the new value of `x`:**
   - If `idx_B` is `[n - 2]` and `B` is `[0]`:
     - `B[len(B) - 1]` is `0`
     - `idx_B[len(B) - 1]` is `n - 2`
     - `len(idx_B)` is `1`
     - Therefore, `x = 0 + ((n - 2) - (n - 2)) * 1 = 0 + 0 = 0`

4. **Update the state:**
   - The value of `x` is now `0`.
   - The other variables (`j`, `n`, `i`, `idx_B`, and `B`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx_B` is `[n - 2]`, `B` is `[0]`, `x` is `0`**.
