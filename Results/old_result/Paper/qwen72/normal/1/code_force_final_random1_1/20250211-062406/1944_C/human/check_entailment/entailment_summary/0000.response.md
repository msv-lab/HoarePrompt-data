Reasoning:  
The provided solution seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually, reading the size of the array and the array itself.

2. **Frequency Counting**: The function `func_1` uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in the array. This is crucial for determining how many times each number appears, which helps in deciding the optimal moves for Alice and Bob.

3. **Game Simulation**: The function simulates the game by maintaining a `start` variable initialized to 0. It checks if the current `start` value exists in the `Counter` and decrements its count. If the next integer (`start + 1`) also exists in the `Counter`, it decrements its count and increments `start`. This process continues until it finds a `start` value that cannot be incremented further because `start + 1` is not present in the `Counter`.

4. **Output**: The function prints the value of `start` or `start + 1` depending on the conditions met during the simulation. This value represents the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

5. **Optimal Strategy**: The logic ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by always choosing the smallest available number that maximizes or minimizes the MEX, respectively. The function effectively simulates this by checking and updating the counts in the `Counter`.

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summary, the function appears to handle the game logic correctly and produce the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
