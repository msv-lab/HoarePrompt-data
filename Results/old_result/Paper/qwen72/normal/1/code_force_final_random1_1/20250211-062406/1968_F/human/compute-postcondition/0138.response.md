Output State: **`results` now contains one additional element 'YES', `x` is now the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where the first element is not less than the new `l`, and `it2` is the index in `v2` where the first element is not less than the new `r`, decremented by 1. `l` is now the integer value of `data[idx]`. `r` is now the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`. `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - (n + 2) * q - 1]` and must be at least 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - (n + 2) * q - 2]` and must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2) + n + 5`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is `int(data[idx - (n + 2) * q - n + i - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is the cumulative XOR of elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to the unique values in `pf` and their respective indices as values, `i` is `n`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[r]` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[l - 1]` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`. The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `q` for the loop to execute again.**
