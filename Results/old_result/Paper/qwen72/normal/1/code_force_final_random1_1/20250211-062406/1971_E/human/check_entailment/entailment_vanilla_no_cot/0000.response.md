Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It reads the input, processes the data to calculate the travel times for the given distances, and outputs the results according to the specifications. The use of `bisect_left` from the `bisect` module helps efficiently find the segment in which the query point lies, and the calculations for the travel time within that segment are performed correctly, taking into account the constant speed between known points. The rounding down of the result is also handled appropriately using the `int()` function. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description.
