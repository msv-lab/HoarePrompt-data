Based on the initial state:

- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is set to `n-1`.
- `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `best` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' or 0 if no such `i` exists.

The print statement is:
```python
print('!', k, best, flush=True)
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement will output a string starting with `'!'`, followed by the values of `k` and `best`.
- `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `best` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' or 0 if no such `i` exists.

Since the exact values of `k` and `best` depend on the specific conditions and values of `res` during the execution of the program, we can only describe them based on the given conditions.

### Output:
Output: **! [k] [best] (where k is the last value of i for which res was '<' or 1 if no such i exists, and best is the last value of i for which res was '<' or 0 if no such i exists)**
