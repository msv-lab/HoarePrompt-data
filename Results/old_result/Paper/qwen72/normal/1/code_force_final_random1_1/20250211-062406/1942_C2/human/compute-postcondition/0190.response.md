Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in `even`, `odd` is a non-empty list of gaps that are greater than 1 and odd, sorted in ascending order, `even` is a list of gaps that are greater than 0 and even, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element, `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in `odd` plus the previous `gap` plus `2 * y`, `y` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `y = 0` sets the value of `y` to 0.
- All other variables (`i`, `next_elem`, `gap`, `odd`, `even`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The initial state specifies that `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in `odd` plus the previous `gap` plus `2 * y`. Since `y` is now 0, the term `2 * y` will be 0, but the rest of the calculation for `ans` remains valid.
- The initial state also specifies that `y` is decreased by the previous `gap // 2`. Since `y` is now 0, this operation no longer affects `y`.
- Therefore, the only change in the state is that `y` is set to 0.
