Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user from the second input, `ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b` for all elements in `b` except the last one, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1, `len(b)` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed.**

In natural language, after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variables `n`, `k`, and `q` retain their initial integer values provided by the user.
- The list `a` remains unchanged, starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user.
- The list `b` also remains unchanged, starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user from the second input.
- The list `ad` still contains 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
- The list `bd` now contains 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b` for all elements in `b` except the last one.
- The variable `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1.
- The length of `b` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed.
