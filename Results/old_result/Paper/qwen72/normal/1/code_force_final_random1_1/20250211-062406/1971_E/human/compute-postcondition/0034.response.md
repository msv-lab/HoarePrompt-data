Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers provided by the user input where `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations plus 1, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user from the second input, `ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b` for all elements in `b` except the last one, `i` is 1, `len(b)` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, `v` is a list containing 0 followed by the values `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., up to `ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]`, `l` is 0, `m` is 0, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than `ql`.** 

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the result of the `bisect_left` function, which finds the index of the first element in the list `a` that is not less than the value `ql`. All other variables remain unchanged.
