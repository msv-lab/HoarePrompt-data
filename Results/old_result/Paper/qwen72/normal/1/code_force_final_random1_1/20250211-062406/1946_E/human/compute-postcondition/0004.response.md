To determine the output state, we need to consider the function `func_1(b, a)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, we cannot know the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we can infer that `c` and `d` are the results of the function `func_1` when called with `b` and `a` as arguments.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are integers where `b > 0` and `a < b`.

After executing the code:
```
c, d = func_1(b, a)
```

The output state is:
- `a` and `b` remain the same (since they are not modified by the code).
- `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`.

Since the exact values of `c` and `d` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, we can only state that `c` and `d` are the results of the function call.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers where `b > 0` and `a < b`; `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`.**
