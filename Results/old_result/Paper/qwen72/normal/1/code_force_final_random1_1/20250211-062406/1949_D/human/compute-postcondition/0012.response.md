The code snippet `b[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the list `b` by 1. Since `i` is 1, the value at `b[1]` is incremented by 1. However, the initial state does not specify the initial value of `b[1]`, so we can only say that `b[1]` is incremented by 1.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, `j` is 1, the character at index 0 of `x` is not 'F', the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', and `b[1]` is incremented by 1.**
