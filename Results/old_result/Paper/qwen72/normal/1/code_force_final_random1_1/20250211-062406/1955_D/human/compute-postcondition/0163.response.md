Output State: **`b_values` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0**

Explanation: The code snippet `cnt_b[i] = 0` assigns the value 0 to `cnt_b[i]`. Since the initial state already specifies that `cnt_b[i]` is 0, there is no change in the value of `cnt_b[i]`. The other conditions in the initial state (`b_values` must contain at least two elements, and `i` is the second element in `b_values`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
