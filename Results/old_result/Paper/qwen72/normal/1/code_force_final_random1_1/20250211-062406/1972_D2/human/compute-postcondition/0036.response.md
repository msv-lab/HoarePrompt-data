Output State: **After all iterations, `n` and `m` are positive integers provided by the user, `x` is 4, `y` is the smallest integer such that `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`, and `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is incremented by 1, changing from 3 to 4.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `y`, and `cnt` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the increment of `x`.
- The condition for `y` and the calculation for `cnt` remain the same, but now with `x` being 4 instead of 3.
