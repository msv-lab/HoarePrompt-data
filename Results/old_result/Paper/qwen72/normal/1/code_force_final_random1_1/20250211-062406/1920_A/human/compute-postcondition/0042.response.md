To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the object `num` in the loop head. The loop iterates over each element in the `num` list. For the loop to execute, `num` must contain at least one element.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`num` must contain at least one element**: This ensures that the loop will iterate at least once.
2. **`i` is the first element in `num`**: Since the loop variable `i` takes the value of each element in `num` during each iteration, before the loop starts, `i` should be the first element in `num`.

The other variables (`n`, `start`, `end`, `count_num`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`num` must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element in `num`**
