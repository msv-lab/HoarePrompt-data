Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` and `v` are integers from the input. If `t` is 3, `num` is a list that now includes `v` as its new last element, and `end` is now `v`. If `t` is 2 and `end` > `v`, `start` and `end` remain unchanged. If `t` is 2 and `end` â‰¤ `v`, `start` and `end` remain unchanged. If `t` is 1 and `start` < `v`, `start` is updated to `v` and `end` is now `v`. If `t` is 1 and `start` â‰¥ `v`, `start` remains unchanged and `end` is now `v`. If `t` is not 1, 2, or 3, `start` and `end` remain unchanged.***
