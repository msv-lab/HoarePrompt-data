Output State: **`l` is `q - 1`, `q` is greater than or equal to `q`, `m` is the final calculated value, `i` is 3, `ql` is the final adjusted value, `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`, if `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the element at index `s` in the list `a` is equal to `ql`, and the loop has not completed all iterations specified by `t`. `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces. `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers from the input split by spaces, and `a` must have at least 3 elements. `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers from the input split by spaces. `ad` is a list containing the values [0, `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, `a[3] - a[2]`]. `bd` is a list containing only the value 0.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`.
- Given `i` is 3, the new value appended to `ad` is `a[3] - a[2]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
