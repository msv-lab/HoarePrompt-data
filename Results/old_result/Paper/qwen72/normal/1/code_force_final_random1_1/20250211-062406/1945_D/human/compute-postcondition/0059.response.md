Output State: **`pos_final` is decreased by 1, `total` is 0, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `v` is `na_frente`, `best` is `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged, the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `best` is updated to the sum of `total` (which is 0) and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Since `total` is 0, `best` is now equal to `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
