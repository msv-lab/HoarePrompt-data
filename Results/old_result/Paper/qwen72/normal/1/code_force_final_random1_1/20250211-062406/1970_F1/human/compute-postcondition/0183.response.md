To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `time` is 2.
   - `command` is a list of strings read from standard input.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `allPlayers`, `team`, `points`, `mov`, `grid`, and `player` remain unchanged.
   - `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`.
   - `nxt` is (`pos[0]` + `mov[com][0]`, `pos[1]` + `mov[com][1]`).
   - `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `time` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `player` is determined based on the conditions:
     - If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, then `player` is `obj`.
     - Otherwise, `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print` statement will format the output as `'%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player)`.
   - Since `time` is 2, the first part of the output will be `2`.
   - The second part of the output will be the value of `player`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, the output will be `2 obj ELIMINATED`.
   - If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `False`, the output will be `2 grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]] ELIMINATED`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the precise output depends on the value of `obj` and the result of `isPlayer(obj)`. However, without specific values for `obj` and the `grid`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **2 [player] ELIMINATED (where [player] is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`)**
