To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where \(1 \leq m \leq n \leq 200,000\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- `b` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\).
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\).
- `cases` is an integer input by the user.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for c in range(cases):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range of `cases`.
- For the loop to execute, `cases` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `c` is the loop counter, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 for each iteration.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `cases` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- `c` should start at 0.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers where \(1 \leq m \leq n \leq 200,000\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `b` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\), `cases` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `c` is 0**.
