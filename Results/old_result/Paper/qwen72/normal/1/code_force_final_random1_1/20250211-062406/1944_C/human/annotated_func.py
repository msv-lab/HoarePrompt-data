#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 0 ≤ arr[i] < len(arr), and the length of arr (n) satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    start = 0
    vis = set()
    while nums.get(start, 0):
        vis.add(start)
        
        nums[start] -= 1
        
        if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
            nums[start + 1] -= 1
            start += 1

            return
        
    #State: The loop will continue to execute until it can no longer find a valid `start + 1` in `nums` with a non-zero frequency. At the end of the loop, `start` will be the last index that was successfully processed, and `vis` will be a set containing all the indices from 0 up to `start`. The frequencies in `nums` will be updated such that for each index `i` in `vis`, the frequency of `i` in `nums` will be reduced by the number of times it was decremented during the loop. If the loop exits due to `nums.get(start, 0)` being 0, the final value of `start` will be the last index processed, and the program will print `start + 1` and terminate.
    print(start)
    #This is printed: start (where start is the last index that was successfully processed before the loop exited)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input and processes it using a `Counter` object `nums` to track the frequency of each integer. It iterates through the list, decrementing the frequency of certain integers based on the current value of `start` and its successor. The function updates a set `vis` to keep track of the indices that have been processed. The function does not return any value but prints the value of `start` when it can no longer find a valid successor in `nums` with a non-zero frequency. After the function concludes, `nums` will have updated frequencies, `vis` will contain the indices processed, and `start` will be the last index that was successfully processed. In specific cases, the function may print `start + 1` if it encounters a situation where `start + 1` has a zero frequency.
