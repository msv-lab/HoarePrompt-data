The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems there might be a misunderstanding since the function signature does not include any parameters (`n` and `m`). Without additional context on what the function is supposed to do with these constraints, it's challenging to accurately describe the functionality. Assuming the function is intended to work with these parameters, let's proceed with the given constraints.

Given the constraints:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.

If the function were to use these parameters, it might look like this:
```python
def func_1(n, m):
```

Output:
- The function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `m`.

Since the specific output is not provided, I'll assume a generic functionality based on common operations involving two positive integers within the given range.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. It returns a result based on the values of `n` and `m`.**

If you can provide more specific details about the output, I can refine the functionality description accordingly.
