Output State: **`num` is now the integer part of the original `num` divided by 10, `a` is updated to `a + num % 10` (using the new value of `num`), and `num` must not be 0.** 

Explanation: The value of `num` is updated to the integer division of `num` by 10, effectively removing the last digit from `num`. The value of `a` is updated to `a + num % 10` using the new value of `num`. The condition that `num` must not be 0 remains unchanged.
