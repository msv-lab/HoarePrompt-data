You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program: 
A = []
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 200001):
    a = func_1(i)
    sum = sum + a
    A.append(sum)
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(A[n - 1])

def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        num = int(num / 10)
    return a



- Annotated Code: 
A = []
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 200001):
    a = func_1(i)
    sum = sum + a
    A.append(sum)
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(A[n - 1])

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        
        num = int(num / 10)
        
    #State: `num` is 0, and `a` is the sum of the digits of the original `num`.
    return a
    #The program returns 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why it works for all potential cases:

1. **Precomputation**: The program precomputes the sum of digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores these values in the list `A`. This is efficient because it avoids recalculating the sum for each test case.

2. **Digit Sum Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number. It iterates through each digit, adding it to the sum, and then dividing the number by 10 until the number becomes 0.

3. **Sum Accumulation**: The program accumulates the sum of digit sums in the variable `sum` and appends this value to the list `A` for each number from 1 to 200,000. This ensures that `A[n-1]` will always contain the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Test Case Handling**: For each test case, the program reads the input `n`, and prints the precomputed sum from the list `A` using `A[n-1]`. This is efficient and ensures that the program can handle up to 10,000 test cases within the time limit.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as `n = 1`, `n = 2`, and large values like `n = 200,000` correctly. The precomputation step ensures that all possible values of `n` within the given constraints are handled.

Given the above points, the program is correct for all potential cases and meets the requirements of the problem description.
