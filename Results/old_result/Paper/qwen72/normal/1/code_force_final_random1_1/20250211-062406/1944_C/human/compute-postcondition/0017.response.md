Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each element `arr[i]` satisfies \(0 \leq arr[i] < \text{len}(arr)\).
- The length of `arr` (n) satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `nums` is a `Counter` object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
- The frequency of the integer 0 in `nums` is decreased by 1.
- The frequency of the integer 1 in `nums` is decreased by 2.
- `arr` must contain at least one occurrence of the integer 0.
- `start` is 1.
- `vis` is a set containing the elements 0 and 1.
- `nums.get(1, 0)` must be greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(start + 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `start` is explicitly given as 1.
- The expression `start + 1` will add 1 to the value of `start`.

### Calculation:
- `start` = 1
- `start + 1` = 1 + 1 = 2

### Output:
Output: **2**
