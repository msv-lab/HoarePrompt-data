The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range specified by the input. The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`, which determines how many times the loop should run. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, indicating the first iteration has just completed.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` needs to be incremented by 1, but since `_` is a placeholder and not used in the loop condition, it does not need to be explicitly adjusted. The loop will continue to execute until the range specified by `int(input())` is exhausted.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration is that `_` is 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented to 1 by the loop mechanism itself. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `res`, and `mex`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to proceed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `res` is a list of integers where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `mex` is the result of repeatedly subtracting each element of `ar` from the initial value `n` as long as `mex > mex - ar[i]` holds true.**
