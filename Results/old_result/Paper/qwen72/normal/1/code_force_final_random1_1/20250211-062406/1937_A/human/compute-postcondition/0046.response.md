To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop condition:

- **Loop Condition**: `while power < n`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n_cases` is greater than 1
   - `n` is log2(n_cases)
   - `power` is 1

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will execute if `power < n`.

3. **Current Values**:
   - `power` is 1.
   - `n` is log2(n_cases).

4. **Condition Check**:
   - For the loop to execute, `1 < log2(n_cases)` must be true.

5. **Mathematical Analysis**:
   - `log2(n_cases) > 1` implies that `n_cases > 2^1`, which simplifies to `n_cases > 2`.

6. **Given Information**:
   - `n_cases` is already stated to be greater than 1. However, for the loop to execute, `n_cases` must be greater than 2.

### Conclusion:
- Since `n_cases` is already greater than 1, but the loop requires `n_cases` to be greater than 2, no adjustment is needed for `n_cases`.
- The current state of `power` (which is 1) and `n` (which is log2(n_cases)) ensures that the loop condition `power < n` will be true as long as `n_cases` is greater than 2.

Therefore, the state does not need any adjustments for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is log2(n_cases), `power` is 1**
