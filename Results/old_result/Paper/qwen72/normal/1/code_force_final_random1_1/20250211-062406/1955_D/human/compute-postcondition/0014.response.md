Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `i` is `m-1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `cnt_b`, and `b_values`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `ans` is now 0, and this is the only change in the state of the program.
