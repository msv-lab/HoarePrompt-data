Output State: **The program returns a reversed list `ans`, which contains `n` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the cumulative product of the elements in `b` from the last to the current index, taken modulo `m`. The list `ans` is reversed, meaning the first element of the returned list corresponds to the last element of the original `ans` list, and so on.**
