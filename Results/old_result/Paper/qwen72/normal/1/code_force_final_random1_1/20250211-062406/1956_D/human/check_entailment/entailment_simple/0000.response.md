Reasoning:

1. **Functionality Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function is designed to apply the MEX operation to a segment of the array `a` from index `l` to `r`. It checks if the current segment can be optimized by setting all elements in the segment to the MEX value. If the segment is a single element and not zero, it sets it to zero. Otherwise, it recursively processes the segment and updates the segment if necessary.
   - **func_2**: This function initializes the process by calling a recursive function to maximize the sum of the array. It returns the final sum, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.
   - **recursive_maximize_sum**: This recursive function divides the array into segments and applies the MEX operation to optimize the sum. It uses a condition to decide whether to apply the MEX operation directly or to split the segment further.
   - **func_3**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the result, and prints the results in the required format.

2. **Logical Flow**:
   - The program correctly handles the base case for a single-element segment in `func_1`.
   - The recursive division and optimization in `recursive_maximize_sum` ensure that the MEX operation is applied optimally.
   - The final sum and operations are correctly calculated and printed in `func_3`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the array is already optimal (e.g., all elements are distinct and cover the range from 0 to n-1).
   - It also handles the case where the array is initially all zeros or has repeated elements.

4. **Constraints**:
   - The program ensures that the number of operations does not exceed 5 * 10^5, which is within the problem's constraints.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the problem's requirements, including the sum, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
