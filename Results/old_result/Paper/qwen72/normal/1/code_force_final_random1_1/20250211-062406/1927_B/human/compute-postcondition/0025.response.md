Output State: **`j` is 2, `l` must be greater than 2, `ans` is updated by appending `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `j` remains 2.
- The condition that `l` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
- The list `ans` is updated by appending the element `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`. This means that the new element appended to `ans` is determined by counting the occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the sublist `rev_array[j:]` and then accessing the corresponding element in `alp` using the count minus one as the index.
