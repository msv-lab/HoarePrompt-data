Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'a' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `tmp` is 'b'.** 

The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in, but it does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `k`, and `tmp` remain the same as in the initial state.
