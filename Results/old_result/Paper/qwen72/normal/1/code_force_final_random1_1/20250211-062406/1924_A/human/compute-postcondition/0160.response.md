Output State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that were added when `cur` was reset to 0, `tmp` is 'b', `cnt` is less than `n`, `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 1, and if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `chr(ord('a') + i)` to `tmp`. Since `i` is 1, `ord('a') + i` evaluates to `98`, which corresponds to the character 'b'. All other variables remain unchanged.
