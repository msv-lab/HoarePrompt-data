### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list `x` containing `n-1` elements.

2. **Array Initialization:**
   - The array `a` is initialized with `n` elements, all set to 0 initially.

3. **Setting the First Element:**
   - The first element `a[0]` is set to 1000. This is a valid choice because it ensures that `a[0]` is greater than any possible value of `x[1]` (since `1 <= x_i <= 500`).

4. **Constructing the Array `a`:**
   - For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where `1 <= i < n`), the value is set to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.
   - This ensures that `a[i] % a[i-1]` will be equal to `x[i-1]` because `a[i]` is exactly `a[i-1]` plus `x[i-1]`.

5. **Output:**
   - The constructed array `a` is printed for each test case.

### Verification:

- **Constraints:**
  - The constraints are respected: `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` and `1 <= x_i <= 500`.
  - The initial value `a[0] = 1000` is within the allowed range and is greater than any possible `x[1]`.

- **Modulo Operation:**
  - For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]` ensures that `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i-1]` because `a[i]` is exactly `a[i-1]` plus `x[i-1]`.

- **Example Test Case:**
  - For the input `n = 4` and `x = [2, 4, 1]`:
    - `a[0] = 1000`
    - `a[1] = 1000 + 2 = 1002`
    - `a[2] = 1002 + 4 = 1006`
    - `a[3] = 1006 + 1 = 1007`
    - Output: `1000 1002 1006 1007`
    - Verification:
      - `1002 % 1000 = 2`
      - `1006 % 1002 = 4`
      - `1007 % 1006 = 1`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the array `a` such that `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i-1]` for all `2 <= i <= n`. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
