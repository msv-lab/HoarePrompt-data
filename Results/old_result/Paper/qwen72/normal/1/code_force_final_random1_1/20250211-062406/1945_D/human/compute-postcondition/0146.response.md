Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads two integers `na_frente` and `pos_final`, followed by two lists of integers `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`. It calculates the minimum cost to move from position `na_frente` to `pos_final` using the costs provided in the lists. The function prints the minimum cost for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The state of the program remains unchanged except for the printed output. **
