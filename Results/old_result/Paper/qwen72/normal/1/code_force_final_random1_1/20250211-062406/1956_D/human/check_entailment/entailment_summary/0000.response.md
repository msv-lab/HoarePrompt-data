### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of an array by performing a specific operation up to \(5 \times 10^5\) times.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements of the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations to achieve it.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**: This function is responsible for modifying the array `a` and appending operations to `ops` based on certain conditions. It ensures that the subarray from `l` to `r` is set to the MEX value if necessary.
   - **`func_2`**: This function initializes the process by calling `recursive_maximize_sum` and returns the final sum, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.
   - **`recursive_maximize_sum`**: This function recursively divides the array into subarrays and applies the MEX operation to maximize the sum. It checks if the sum of the current subarray is less than or equal to the square of its length and applies the MEX operation accordingly.
   - **`func_3`**: This function handles the input and output, reads the array, calls `func_2`, and prints the results.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **Base Case Handling**: `func_1` correctly handles the base case when `l` equals `r` and sets the element to 0 if it is not already 0.
   - **Recursive Division**: `recursive_maximize_sum` correctly divides the array into subarrays and applies the MEX operation to maximize the sum.
   - **Sum Calculation**: `func_2` correctly calculates the sum of the modified array and the number of operations.
   - **Input/Output Handling**: `func_3` correctly reads the input, calls the necessary functions, and prints the results in the required format.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The functions handle edge cases such as arrays with a single element or arrays where the MEX operation does not change the sum.
   - The recursive division ensures that the operations are applied efficiently within the limit of \(5 \times 10^5\).

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions work together to maximize the sum of the array and generate the sequence of operations as specified.

**Correctness: **True****
