Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1), `m` is the new input integer and must be greater than 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `j` is 2. If `gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.***
