Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are lists of integers derived from the input strings, where each element is a digit from 1 to 9. If `i` is not equal to `len(a)`, `new` is a list where the first `i` elements are `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the rest are `None`, and `new2` is a list where the first `i` elements are `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the rest are `None`. If `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `new` is a list where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`, and `new2` is a list where each element is `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`.***
