Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree. `queue` is a deque that contains tuples of the form `(node, distance)` and may be empty or contain elements representing unprocessed nodes and their distances from the `start` node. `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been processed, including `start` and all its reachable neighbors. `current` is the last node from the tuple that was removed from the front of the queue, and `dist` is the distance from the `start` node to the `current` node. The loop will continue until either the `queue` is empty or the `current` node equals `target`, at which point the distance (`dist`) from the `start` node to the `current` node is returned.**
