The code snippet updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` from its current value. Let's break down the impact:

- `b` is initially set to the last element of `B` minus `B[r - l]`.
- The new value of `b` is calculated as `b - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is equal to `n`.
- `i` is 1.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order.
- `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is '>' or not.
- `r` is the length of `B` minus 1.
- `a` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- `b` is equal to the last element of `B` minus `B[r - l]`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `b` is updated to `b - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is '>' or not, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `a` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is equal to the last element of `B` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`.**
