The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables.

Output: **No**
