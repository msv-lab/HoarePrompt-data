Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `word` is 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'**.

Explanation: The code concatenates the string 'a', the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 28`, and the string 'z', and assigns the result to the variable `word`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
