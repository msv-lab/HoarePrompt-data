The variable in the loop head is `nums.get(start, 0)`, so we can only adjust this expression. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `nums.get(start, 0)`. If this value is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the frequency of the integer 1 in `nums` is the original frequency minus 1, and `start` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `nums.get(1, 0)` must be greater than 0.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` (n) satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and the frequency of the integer 0 in `nums` is decreased by 1. The frequency of the integer 1 in `nums` is now the original frequency minus 1. `arr` must contain at least one occurrence of the integer 0. `start` is 1. `vis` is a set containing the element 0. `nums.get(1, 0)` must be greater than 0**
