Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `a` and `b` are integer values from the input.
   - If both `a` and `b` are even, the condition `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0` holds.
   - Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd.
   - If `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is true, then the respective condition holds.
   - Otherwise, neither `(a - b == -a, a)` nor `(b - a == -b, b)` is true, and the difference `(a - b)` is either odd (not divisible by 2) or even (divisible by 2).
   - The range defined by the user input must be greater than 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('yes')
   ```

Given the initial state and the conditions, the print statement simply outputs the string `'yes'`. The conditions described in the initial state do not affect the output of the print statement directly because the print statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **yes**
