You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string. The variable `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during all iterations of the loop. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the variable `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is extended by the current value of `tmp` followed by `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times, where `tmp` is the character corresponding to the bit position if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains a sequence of characters that collectively cover all `k` distinct alphabets at least `n` times. If such a sequence exists, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string `ans` that includes the missing characters to meet the requirement, appending the necessary characters to ensure the sequence is valid. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the string `s`.
   - If not, we need to provide one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It initializes `cnt` to count the number of valid subsequences found, `cur` to track the current bitmask of characters seen, and `ans` to store the constructed string.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`:
     - Converts the character to its corresponding index (`cur_ss`).
     - Checks if the character has been seen before using the bitmask `cur`.
     - If the character is new, updates the bitmask `cur`.
     - If all `k` characters have been seen (i.e., `cur == (1 << k) - 1`), increments `cnt` and resets `cur`.
     - Appends the character to `ans`.
   - After processing the string, it checks if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`:
     - If true, prints "YES".
     - If false, prints "NO" and constructs a string that does not occur as a subsequence:
       - Finds the first character that is missing from the bitmask `cur`.
       - Appends this character to `ans`.
       - Appends `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters to `ans`.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the construction of the string that does not occur as a subsequence.
   - The logic for constructing the string `ans` is flawed. It should generate a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence, but the current logic appends characters in a way that may not ensure the string is of length `n` and does not occur as a subsequence.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters and check if they are subsequences of `s`.
   - If any string is not a subsequence, print "NO" and the string.
   - If all strings are subsequences, print "YES".

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly handle the construction of the string that does not occur as a subsequence, leading to potential incorrect outputs.
