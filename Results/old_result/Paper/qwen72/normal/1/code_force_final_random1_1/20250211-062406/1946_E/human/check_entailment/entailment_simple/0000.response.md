### Reasoning:

1. **Factorial Calculation:**
   - The program precomputes factorials up to \(200,000\) and stores them in the list `facts`. This is done correctly using modular arithmetic to avoid overflow.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of \(n\), \(m_1\), and \(m_2\), followed by the lists of prefix and suffix maximum indices.

3. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index is the same as the first suffix maximum index, and if the first prefix maximum index is 1 and the last suffix maximum index is \(n\). If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, which is correct because these conditions must hold for a valid permutation.

4. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program uses the function `func_2` to calculate combinations. The function `func_2` calls `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of a number, which is used to calculate the combination \(C(n, k)\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Permutation Counting:**
   - The program iterates over the suffix maximum indices and calculates the number of ways to place the remaining elements. It then iterates over the prefix maximum indices in reverse order and performs similar calculations.
   - Finally, it multiplies the results by the factorials of the gaps between consecutive prefix and suffix maximum indices to account for the permutations of the remaining elements.

6. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - All calculations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure the results fit within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximum indices. The use of modular arithmetic and the combination calculation are appropriate for the problem constraints.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
