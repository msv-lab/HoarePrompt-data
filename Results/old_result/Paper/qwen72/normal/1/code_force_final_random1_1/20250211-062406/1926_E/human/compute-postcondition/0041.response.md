The value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `m` will be the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is the sum of all elements in the original `L`, `pow` is \(2^{\text{length of original } L}\), `m` is \((n + 1) // 2\)**.
