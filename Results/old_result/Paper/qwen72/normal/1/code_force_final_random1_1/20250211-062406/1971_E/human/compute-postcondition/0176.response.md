Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input split by spaces.
- `len(b)` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`.
- `v` is a list of ratios of corresponding elements from `ad` and `bd`.
- `a` has at least `len(b) + (len(a) - 1)` elements.
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `l` is 0.
- `m` is updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
- `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index in `a` where `ql` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the value at index `s` in `a` is equal to `ql`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int(m), end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `b` and `bd`**:
   - `b` starts with 0 and is followed by integers from the input.
   - `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`.

2. **List `v`**:
   - `v` is a list of ratios of corresponding elements from `ad` and `bd`.

3. **Variables `q`, `l`, and `m`**:
   - `q` is a positive integer.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.

4. **Variable `ql`**:
   - `ql` is initially some value and is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.

5. **Index `s`**:
   - `s` is the index in `a` where `ql` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`.

### Calculation of `m`:
- `m` is calculated using the formula `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
- Since `s` is the index where `ql` should be inserted in `a`, and `a` is sorted, `s` is determined by the value of `ql`.

### Final Output:
- The `print` statement will output the integer value of `m`.

Given the complexity and the lack of specific values for `b`, `ad`, `a`, and `ql`, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables and their relationships.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s], and s is the index in a where ql should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of a)**
