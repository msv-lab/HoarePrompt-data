Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the logic and verify if it matches the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases, followed by the details of each test case (n, m, array a, and string s). This part is correctly implemented.

2. **Function Definition (`func_1`)**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements of `a` in the order they are removed, and two pointers `l` and `r` to track the left and right ends of the array `a`.
   - **Processing Commands**: For each command in the string `s`, the function appends the appropriate element from `a` to `b` and updates the pointers `l` and `r` accordingly.
   - **Cumulative Product Calculation**: After constructing the list `b`, the function calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` from the last to the first, taking the result modulo `m` at each step. The results are stored in the list `ans`.
   - **Reversing the Result**: Finally, the function returns the reversed list `ans` to match the order of the commands.

3. **Output**: The main loop prints the results for each test case.

Let's verify if this logic matches the problem requirements:
- **Initial Output**: The program correctly outputs the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` when divided by `m` before any command is processed.
- **Command Processing**: The program correctly processes each command ('L' or 'R') by removing the appropriate element from `a` and appending it to `b`.
- **Cumulative Product**: The program correctly calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, ensuring that the product is taken modulo `m` at each step.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
