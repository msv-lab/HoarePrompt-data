Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 2, `x` is the new input string, `xx` is a list that now includes the new input string `x`, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged except possibly `b[1]` and `b[2]`, `j` is 1, and the character at index 0 of `x` is not 'F'. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', then `b[1]` and `b[2]` are each incremented by 1.***
