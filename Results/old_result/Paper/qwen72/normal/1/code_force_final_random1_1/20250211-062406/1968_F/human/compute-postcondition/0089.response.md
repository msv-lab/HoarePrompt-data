Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is increased by `q * (n + 2) + 2`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index, `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values in `pf` and values being lists of indices where these `pf` values occur, `results` contains the final results of the loop's operations ('YES' or 'NO' for each iteration), and the last element of `results` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The list `a` is reinitialized to a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `idx`, `pf`, `mp`, `results`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
