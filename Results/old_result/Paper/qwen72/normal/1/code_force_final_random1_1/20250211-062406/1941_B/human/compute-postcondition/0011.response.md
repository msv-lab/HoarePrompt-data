The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state mentions several variables and conditions:
  - `_` is a placeholder (its value is not specified).
  - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
  - `a` is an input integer.
  - `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting an input string.
  - The loop will continue to execute as long as the current value of `_` is less than the value of `t`.

However, none of these variables or conditions affect the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

### Output:
Output: **NO**
