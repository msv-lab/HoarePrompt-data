To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `b` is a list of integers read from input.
- `i` is `m-1`.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`.
- `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `curr` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `m` is greater than 0.
- The variable `i` is used as the loop counter, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 until it reaches `m-1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0.
- The initial value of `i` should be 0, as it is the starting point of the loop.

### Final State:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `b` is a list of integers read from input.
- `i` is 0 (initial value for the loop).
- `m` is greater than 0 (to ensure the loop executes at least once).
- `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`.
- `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `curr` is 0.

### State:
**`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 0**
