The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables.

Output: **Yes**
