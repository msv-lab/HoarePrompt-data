Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than 0.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed.
4. `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in `arr`.
5. `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or `-1` if '1' is not found in `arr`.
6. `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1` if `x` and `y` are valid and `n - y > x`, otherwise `z` is an empty string.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(z.count('0'))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `x` and `y`:**
   - `x` is the index of the first '1' in `arr`.
   - `y` is the index of the last '1' in `arr`.

2. **Determine `z`:**
   - If `x` and `y` are both valid (i.e., not `-1`) and `n - y > x`, then `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1`.
   - Otherwise, `z` is an empty string.

3. **Count '0' in `z`:**
   - The `count('0')` method will count the number of occurrences of '0' in the string `z`.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **No '1' in `arr`:**
   - `x = -1` and `y = -1`.
   - Since `x` and `y` are not valid, `z` is an empty string.
   - `z.count('0')` will return `0`.

2. **'1' is present in `arr`:**
   - `x` and `y` are valid indices.
   - If `n - y > x`, then `z` is the substring from `x` to `n - y - 1`.
   - The number of '0's in this substring will be counted.

### Example:
- Suppose `arr = "00100100"`, `n = 8`.
  - `x = 2` (first '1' is at index 2).
  - `y = 5` (last '1' is at index 5).
  - `n - y = 8 - 5 = 3`.
  - `z` is the substring from index `2` to `3 - 1 = 2`, which is `"00"`.
  - `z.count('0')` will return `2`.

### General Case:
- If `x` and `y` are valid and `n - y > x`, `z` will be a substring of `arr` from `x` to `n - y - 1`.
- The number of '0's in this substring will be printed.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the number of '0's in the substring `z` if `x` and `y` are valid and `n - y > x`. If `z` is an empty string, the output will be `0`.

Output: **z.count('0') (where z is the substring of arr from index x to n - y - 1 if x and y are valid and n - y > x, otherwise z is an empty string)**
