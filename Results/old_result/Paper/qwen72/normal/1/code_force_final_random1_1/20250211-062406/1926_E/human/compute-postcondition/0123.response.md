The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and the typical structure of such functions, it likely accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the function may also implicitly handle multiple test cases, indicated by `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4).

Given the constraints and the expected output, the function's primary purpose is to process these parameters and return a result based on the relationship between `n` and `k`.
