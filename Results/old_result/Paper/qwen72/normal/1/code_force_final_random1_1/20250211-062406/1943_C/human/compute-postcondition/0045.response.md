Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `path_ba` contains the full path from vertex `b` back to the starting vertex `a` (or the root of the BFS tree), with each element in the list representing a vertex in the path. The variable `n` will be `-1` because the loop breaks when `n` becomes `-1`. All other variables (`u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `previous`, `_`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.**
