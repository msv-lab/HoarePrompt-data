The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the code specifically decrements `cnt_b[a[1]]` by 1. 

Let's break down the impact:

- `i` is 1, so `a[i]` refers to `a[1]`.
- `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decremented by 1.
- The other variables (`m`, `b_values`, `ans`, `curr`) remain unchanged.

Since the initial state specifies that `cnt_b[a[0]]` was already decremented by 1 if `a[0]` is in `b_values`, and `curr` was set based on the condition of `cnt_b[a[0]]`, these conditions are not affected by the current code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decreased by 1, `curr` remains 0 if `cnt_b[a[0]]` is less than 0, otherwise `curr` is 1.**
