Output State: **`dp` is `True`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `tc` is `tc - 1` and `tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, followed by a `0`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `len(arr) - 1`.
- The values of `dp`, `i`, `tc`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial state.
