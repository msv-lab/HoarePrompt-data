Output State: **`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and the original value of `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is reduced by `delta`, `a` is a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of non-zero integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second, `n` is the number of monsters (equal to the length of `a` and `x`), `sorted_indices` is a list of indices from 0 to n-1 sorted based on the absolute values of the elements in `x`, `distance` is 0, `pos` is `pos + 1`, and `rest` is `rest - delta`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pos` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`delta`, `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, `distance`, and `rest`) remain unchanged except for the fact that `pos` has been updated.
- The initial conditions for `delta`, `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, `rest`, and `pos` are still valid but with the updated value of `pos`.
