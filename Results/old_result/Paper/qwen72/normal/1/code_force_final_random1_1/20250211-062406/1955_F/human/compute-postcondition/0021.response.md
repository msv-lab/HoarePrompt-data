The value of `cnt` is incremented by the floor division of `x` by 2. Since `x` is the first element of the list `a`, the new value of `cnt` will be the original value of `cnt` plus `math.floor(a[0] / 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 200, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `cnt` is `cnt + math.floor(a[0] / 2)`, `x` is the first element of `a`.**
