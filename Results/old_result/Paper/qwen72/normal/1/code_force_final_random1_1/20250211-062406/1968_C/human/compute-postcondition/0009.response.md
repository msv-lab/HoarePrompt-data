The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros except `a[0]` which is 1000, `a[1]` which is 1000 + `x[0]`, and `a[2]` which is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
