The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into two parts, converting each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n` and `m`.

- `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `m` is assigned the second integer from the input.

The initial state variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input.**
