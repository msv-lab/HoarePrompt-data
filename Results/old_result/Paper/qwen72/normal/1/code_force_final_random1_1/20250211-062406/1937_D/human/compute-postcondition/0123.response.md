To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `j` is equal to `n`
   - `i` is 1
   - `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order
   - `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `l` is 1 if `s[i]` is '>', otherwise `l` is 0
   - `r` is the length of `B` if `s[i]` is '>', otherwise `r` is the length of `B` minus 1
   - `a` is `A[l]`
   - `x` is `r - (l + 2)`
   - `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[r - (l + 2)]`

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)
   ```

3. **Impact Analysis**:
   - The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` from the current value of `b`.

4. **Calculating the New Value of `b`**:
   - The new value of `b` is:
     \[
     b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) \times (x + 1)
     \]

5. **Output State**:
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is 1 if `s[i]` is '>', otherwise `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` if `s[i]` is '>', otherwise `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[r - (l + 2)] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`**.
