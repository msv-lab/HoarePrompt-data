Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to all zeros, `i` is `n-1`.** 

Explanation: The code initializes the list `a` to a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0. The previous values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.
