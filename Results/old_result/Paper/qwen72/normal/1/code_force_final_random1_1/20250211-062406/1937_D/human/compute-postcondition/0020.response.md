The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2. If the first character of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is '>', then `idx_A` is `[1]` and `A` is `[x, x + 1]` where `x` is the last element of `A` before the update. If the first character of `s` is not '>', then `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged as empty lists. If `s[1]` is '>', then `idx_A` is updated to `[1]` and `A` is updated to `[x, x + 1]` if `s[0]` is '>', otherwise `idx_A` is `[0, 1]` and `A` is `[0, 1]`. If `s[1]` is not '>', then `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged.**
