Reasoning:  
1. The function `func_1` is not used in the provided code, so we will focus on `func_2`.
2. `func_2` takes a string `s` as input, which is a balanced parentheses sequence.
3. It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store information about each character in the input string.
4. It iterates over the string `s`, maintaining a running balance of parentheses. For each character, it appends a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info` containing the current balance, the position of the character, and the character itself.
5. After the loop, it sorts the `balance_info` list based on the balance (in ascending order) and, in case of ties, by the position (in descending order).
6. Finally, it constructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list and prints it.

The logic implemented in `func_2` correctly follows the steps described in the problem statement for performing the balanced shuffle operation. The sorting criteria ensure that the sequence is shuffled according to the specified rules.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
