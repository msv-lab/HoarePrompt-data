Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer input by the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of piles, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = map(int, input().split())
    lis = sorted(set(l))
    if 1 not in lis or len(lis) == 1:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        test = True
        for j in range(1, len(lis)):
            if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1:
                if j % 2 == 1:
                    print('Bob')
                else:
                    print('Alice')
                test = False
                break
        if test == True:
            if len(lis) % 2 == 1:
                print('Alice')
            else:
                print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, and `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, the program maintains these conditions. If 1 is in `lis` and the length of `lis` is greater than 1, `test` indicates whether no two consecutive elements in `lis` have a difference greater than 1, and the length of `lis` remains either odd or even as it was initially.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, and `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If 1 is not in `lis` or the length of `lis` is 1, the program maintains these conditions. If 1 is in `lis` and the length of `lis` is greater than 1, `test` indicates whether no two consecutive elements in `lis` have a difference greater than 1, and the length of `lis` remains either odd or even as it was initially. If `test` is True, all consecutive elements in `lis` have a difference of at most 1. If `test` is False, `test` remains False, indicating that there are at least two consecutive elements in `lis` with a difference greater than 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, and `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If `1` is not in `lis` or `len(lis) == 1`, `test` remains unchanged, indicating whether no two consecutive elements in `lis` have a difference greater than 1, and the length of `lis` remains either odd or even as it was initially. If `1` is in `lis` and `len(lis) > 1`, `test` is True if the difference between any two consecutive elements in `lis` is at most 1, and `test` is False otherwise.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
