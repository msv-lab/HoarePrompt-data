The code snippet `score += l[i]` updates the value of `score` by adding the value of the element at index `i` in the list `l`. Given the initial state, let's determine the output state:

- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` remains an input integer greater than 0.
- `l` remains a sorted list of integers from the new input.
- `score` was initially 0 and is now updated to `l[i]`.
- `i` is 2 * n - 2, which is a specific index in the list `l`.

Since `i` is 2 * n - 2, the value of `score` is now the value of the element at index `2 * n - 2` in the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is `l[2 * n - 2]`, `i` is 2 * n - 2, and `2 * n` is greater than 0.**
