Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `i` is 0, `idx_B` contains the indices of all occurrences of '<' in the string `s` in descending order, `B` contains the calculated values based on the positions of '<' in `s` and the formula provided in the loop, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1, `n` is greater than 0, the character at index `i` of the string `s` is not '>', `a` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `b` by adding `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` to its current value.
- The values of `j`, `i`, `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, `r`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `b` is `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
