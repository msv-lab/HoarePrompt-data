The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 1, `m` is the input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is 1, `ans` is 'NO' if `impossible` was `True`. The first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is `m-2`. If the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the first character of the second string in `gr`, or the last character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the second string in `gr`, then `impossible` is now `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.**
