Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `path_ba` contains the full path from vertex `b` back to the starting vertex `a` (or the root of the BFS tree), with each element in the list representing a vertex in the path. The length of `path_ba` is odd. The variable `n` is `-1`. All other variables (`u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `previous`, `_`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state. `ops` is an empty list. `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`. `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(ci + 1):
    ops.append((c, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `path_ba` contains the full path from vertex `b` back to the starting vertex `a` (or the root of the BFS tree) and has at least one element, `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` (which is at least 0), `i` is 0, `n` is `-1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, 0)`, `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`, and all other variables (`u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `previous`, `_`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `path_ba` contains the full path from vertex `b` back to the starting vertex `a` (or the root of the BFS tree) and has at least one element, `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba` (which is at least 0), `i` is 1, `n` is `-1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)`, `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`, and all other variables (`u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `previous`, `_`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `path_ba` contains the full path from vertex `b` back to the starting vertex `a` (or the root of the BFS tree) and has at least one element, `ci` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `n` is `-1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, and `(c, 2)`, `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`, and all other variables (`u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `previous`, `_`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
