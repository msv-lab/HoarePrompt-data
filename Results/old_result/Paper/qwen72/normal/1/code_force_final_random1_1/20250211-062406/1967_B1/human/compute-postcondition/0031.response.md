To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the loop step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are input integers.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `count` is initialized to `m + 1`.
- `ans` is the final value calculated by the loop, which is the sum of `n` and the results of the operations performed in each iteration of the loop.
- `countmins` is initialized to `m`.
- `g` is calculated as `int(n / m) - (m - 1)`.
- If `g` is less than `m - 1`, the loop breaks before reaching `count = m + 1`.

### Loop Logic:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `i = 0`
   - `count = m + 1`
   - `ans = n`
   - `countmins = m`
   - `g = int(n / m) - (m - 1)`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs while `i < count`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - In each iteration, `ans` is updated by adding some value.
   - The exact value added to `ans` in each iteration is not specified, but it is implied that the loop performs some operation involving `g` and `countmins`.

4. **Break Condition:**
   - If `g < m - 1`, the loop breaks.

### Calculation of `ans`:
- The loop runs until either `i` reaches `count` or the break condition is met.
- The value of `ans` is initially `n`.
- In each iteration, `ans` is updated by adding some value, which is not explicitly defined but is related to `g` and `countmins`.

### Final Value of `ans`:
- The final value of `ans` depends on the number of iterations and the operations performed in each iteration.
- Since the exact operations are not specified, we can only say that `ans` is the sum of `n` and the results of the operations performed in each iteration.

### Break Condition:
- If `g < m - 1`, the loop breaks before reaching `count = m + 1`.
- This means that the number of iterations might be less than `m + 1`.

### Output:
Given the initial state and the loop logic, the final value of `ans` is the sum of `n` and the results of the operations performed in each iteration of the loop. Since the exact operations are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the variables and conditions provided.

Output: **int(ans) (where ans is the sum of n and the results of the operations performed in each iteration of the loop, and the loop may break if g < m - 1)**
