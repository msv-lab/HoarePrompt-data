Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers parsed from the first line of the input provided to `open(0)`. The original value of `b` is added to the new value of `b`. `s` is the second line of the input.**

Explanation:
- The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers parsed from the first line of the input.
- The new value of `b` is the sum of the original value of `b` and the new value of `b` parsed from the input.
- The variable `s` holds the second line of the input.
- The precondition that `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9 remains valid.
