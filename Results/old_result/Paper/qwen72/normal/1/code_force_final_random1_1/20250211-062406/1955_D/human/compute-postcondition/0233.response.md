Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `m` is the length of the list `b`, `k` remains an input integer, `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from the input. `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative. If `a[0]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[0]]` is incremented by 1. If `a[0]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[0]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decremented by 1. If `a[1]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[1]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is further decremented by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 3. If `curr` is less than `k`, `ans` is set to 2. If `a[0]` is not in `b_values`, `curr` and `ans` remain unchanged. If `a[1 + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[1 + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `cnt_b[a[1 + m]]` is decremented by 1. If `a[1 + m]` is not in `b_values`, `cnt_b` and `curr` remain unchanged. `cnt_b[a[2]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[2]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decremented by 1.***
