Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `a` will contain the remaining health of each monster, with some elements possibly being 0 if those monsters have been defeated. `rest` will be `k`, indicating that the number of bullets available is now equal to `k`. `pos` will be equal to the number of monsters that have been defeated, which is also the number of elements in `a` that are 0, and `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`. The absolute value of the element at the index `sorted_indices[pos]` in `x` will still not be equal to `distance + 1`, assuming there are any monsters left with positive health. The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` will remain unchanged except for the modifications to `a` and `rest` as described. `distance` is now `distance + 1`. If the absolute value of the element at the index `sorted_indices[pos]` in `x` is equal to `distance`, the program returns False.
Code of the loop:
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
    delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
    rest -= delta
    a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
    if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
        pos += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`, `rest` remains `k - 2 * delta`, `pos` is the number of monsters that have been defeated (which is also the number of elements in `a` that are 0), `distance` is now `distance + 1`, and `delta` is the minimum of the original `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was already 0, then `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is 0, `pos` is incremented by 1, and `delta` is the minimum of the original `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`. The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged except for the modifications to `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` as applicable.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`delta` is the minimum of the original `rest` and either `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` (depending on whether `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0). `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is decreased by `delta`, `rest` is now `k - 2 * delta - delta` and must be greater than 0, `pos` is the number of monsters that have been defeated and must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`, `distance` is now `distance + 1`, and the values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged except for the modifications to `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`delta` is the minimum of the original `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`, `rest` is now `k - 3 * delta`, `pos` is the number of monsters that have been defeated and must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`, `distance` is now `distance + 1`, and the values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged except for the modifications to `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `delta` is the minimum of the original `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is decreased by `delta`, `pos` is incremented by 1, and the values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged except for the modifications to `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
