The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer

The code does not affect the values of `t` or `n`. It introduces a new variable `a` which is a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input.**
