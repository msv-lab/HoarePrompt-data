Precondition: **a and b are integers.** 

However, based on the problem description provided, the function `func_1` seems to be a placeholder and does not match the complexity of the problem described. The actual function should handle the game logic, which involves multiple inputs and a sequence of actions. Here's a more appropriate function signature and precondition for the described problem:

Function definition:
```python
def quidditch_game(N, M, field, T, actions):
```

Precondition: **N and M are integers such that 3 <= N, M <= 99 and both are odd. field is a list of N strings, each string containing M pairs of characters representing the initial state of the field. T is an integer such that 0 <= T <= 10000. actions is a list of T strings, each string describing an action in the game.**
