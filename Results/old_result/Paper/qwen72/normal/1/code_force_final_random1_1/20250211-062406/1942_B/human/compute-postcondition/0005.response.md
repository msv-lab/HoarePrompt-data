To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions present in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. This means the loop will execute if `len(ar) > 0`.

2. **Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `i`: This is the loop variable that will take values from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.
   - `ar`: This is the list over which the loop iterates.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `ar` must have at least one element (`len(ar) > 0`).
   - The initial value of `i` should be `len(ar) - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (unchanged).
- `_` is 0 (unchanged).
- `n` is an input integer (unchanged).
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, and it must have at least one element.
- `res` is a list of `None` with length `n` (unchanged).
- `mex` is `n` (unchanged).
- `i` is `len(ar) - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least one element, `res` is a list of `None` with length `n`, `mex` is `n`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`**
