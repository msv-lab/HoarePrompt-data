The function `func_13` takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, where at least one of them is not zero. It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` such that `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, and `x` and `y` are coefficients satisfying the equation `a*x + b*y = g`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively computes the values using the Euclidean algorithm. After the function concludes, the final state is that the GCD of `a` and `b` is computed, and the coefficients `x` and `y` are determined such that the linear combination of `a` and `b` equals the GCD.
