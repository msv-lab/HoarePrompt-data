Postcondition: ***`a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`, `rest` remains `k - 2 * delta`, `pos` is the number of monsters that have been defeated (which is also the number of elements in `a` that are 0), `distance` is now `distance + 1`, and `delta` is the minimum of the original `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was already 0, then `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is 0, `pos` is incremented by 1, and `delta` is the minimum of the original `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`. The values of `a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged except for the modifications to `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` as applicable.***
