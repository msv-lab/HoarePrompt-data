To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given program state and the `while` loop condition.

### Program State Before the Loop:
- `t` is an integer where 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 + 1
- `n` is the first input integer greater than 0
- `m` is the second input integer greater than 0
- `k` is the third input integer greater than 0
- `newk` is `k // 2`
- `i` is 1
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user
- `b` is a new list of integers input by the user
- `aOnes` is 0
- `bOnes` is 0

### Loop Condition:
```
while i <= k:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `i <= k`.
- The variable `i` is 1, and `k` is an integer greater than 0.
- Since `i` is 1 and `k` is greater than 0, the condition `i <= k` is always true for the first iteration.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is 1 and `k` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once without any adjustments needed.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 3 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 + 1, `n` is the first input integer greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer greater than 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0**
