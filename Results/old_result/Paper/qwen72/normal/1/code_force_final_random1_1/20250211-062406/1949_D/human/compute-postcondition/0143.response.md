Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3, `nx` is a string that has been appended with 'S'**

Explanation: The code appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. The new value of `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus the character 'S'.
