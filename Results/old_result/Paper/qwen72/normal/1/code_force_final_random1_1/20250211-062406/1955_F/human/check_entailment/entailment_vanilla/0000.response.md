### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers is zero.
   - The sequence consists of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, and we are given the counts of each of these numbers.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The bitwise XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit position that is set to 1 is even.
   - The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 have the following binary representations:
     - 1: `0001`
     - 2: `0010`
     - 3: `0011`
     - 4: `0100`
   - The XOR of these numbers can be simplified by considering their parity (odd or even counts).

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The function `func` processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It then applies a transformation to each count: `int(x) - int(x) % 2`, which effectively rounds down to the nearest even number.
   - The sum of these transformed counts is divided by 2, which gives the number of pairs of numbers that can be removed to keep the XOR zero.
   - Additionally, it checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, which would add one more win for Bob.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Transformation:** `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))`
     - This converts each count to the nearest even number.
   - **Sum of Pairs:** `sum(p) // 2`
     - This calculates the number of pairs of numbers that can be removed to keep the XOR zero.
   - **Additional Check:** `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)`
     - This checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, which would add one more win for Bob.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The transformation ensures that we are only considering even counts, which helps in maintaining the XOR zero.
   - The additional check ensures that if all counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are odd, Bob gets one more win.
   - The logic aligns with the problem statement and the examples provided.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Correctness: **True**
