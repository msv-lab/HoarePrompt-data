Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The logic in the provided solution has a fundamental flaw in how it calculates the `mex` value and updates the result array `res`. Specifically, the way `mex` is updated and used to calculate `res[i]` does not correctly reflect the relationship between the MEX of the prefix of the permutation and the values in the array `a`.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The MEX calculation should consider the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the current prefix of the permutation. However, the code simply updates `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from the current `mex`, which does not ensure that `mex` remains the correct MEX for the prefix.

2. **Backward Iteration**: The backward iteration approach is not inherently wrong, but the way `mex` is managed and the values are assigned to `res` is flawed. The MEX should be recalculated or tracked correctly as you move through the array.

3. **Handling of `mex` Updates**: The condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]` is redundant and does not serve the purpose of correctly updating `mex`.

To fix this, a more appropriate approach would involve maintaining a set of available numbers and correctly calculating the MEX for each prefix of the permutation. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        seen = set()
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            while mex in seen:
                mex += 1
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            seen.add(res[i])
        
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

func()
```

This corrected version maintains a set of seen numbers and correctly calculates the MEX for each prefix, ensuring that the permutation `p` is constructed correctly based on the given array `a`.
