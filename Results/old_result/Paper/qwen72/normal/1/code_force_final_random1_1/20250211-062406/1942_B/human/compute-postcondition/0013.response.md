Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least one element, `res` is a list of `None` with length `n` except for the last element which is `mex - ar[-1]` and the second-to-last element which is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, and `i` remains `len(ar) - 2`.***
