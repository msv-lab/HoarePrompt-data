The provided code snippet initializes an empty list `gr`. This action does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. The values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the first integer provided by the user input, `m` is the second integer provided by the user input, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`. If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, `ans` remains 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.**
