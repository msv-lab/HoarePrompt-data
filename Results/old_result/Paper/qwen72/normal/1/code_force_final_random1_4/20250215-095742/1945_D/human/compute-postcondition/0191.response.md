Postcondition: ***`a` remains a list of strings with any number of elements, `y` is `max_p - 1`, `b` is a non-empty collection, `b_values` contains the integer values of all elements in `b` appended to its existing values, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` must be greater than 0, and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, `nf`, `a_values`) retain their original values and relationships as described in the initial state. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`, then `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` for each iteration of the loop plus `b_values[y]`. If `y` is 1, `a_values[0]` is included in the calculation of `custo`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]`, then `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` for each iteration of the loop plus `a_values[y]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
