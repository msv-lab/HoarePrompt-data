You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program: 
A = []
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 200001):
    a = func_1(i)
    sum = sum + a
    A.append(sum)
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(A[n - 1])

def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        num = int(num / 10)
    return a



- Annotated Code: 
A = []
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 200001):
    a = func_1(i)
    sum = sum + a
    A.append(sum)
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(A[n - 1])

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        
        num = int(num / 10)
        
    #State: `num` is 0, `a` is the sum of all digits of the original `num`.
    return a
    #The program returns 0, as `a` is the sum of all digits of the original `num`, which is 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Precomputation**: The program precomputes the sum of digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores these values in the list `A`. This is efficient and ensures that each test case can be answered in constant time.

2. **Digit Sum Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number. It iterates through each digit, adds it to the sum, and continues until the number is reduced to zero.

3. **Sum Accumulation**: The main loop accumulates the sum of digit sums for each number from 1 to 200,000 and stores these cumulative sums in the list `A`.

4. **Test Case Handling**: For each test case, the program reads the input `n`, looks up the precomputed sum in the list `A`, and prints the result. This ensures that the program handles multiple test cases efficiently.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as `n = 1`, `n = 2`, and `n = 200000` correctly. The precomputation step ensures that all possible values of `n` within the specified range are covered.

Given that the program follows the problem description for every potential case and handles all edge cases correctly, it is deemed correct.
