Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `x` is equal to `a[k]`, `ind` is a list containing `[1, 2]` if `a[1]` is not greater than `x`, otherwise `ind` is a list containing `[1, 1, 2]`, `c` is 2 if `a[1]` is not greater than `x`, otherwise `c` is 3, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. If `c` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. No changes are made to `ind` and `c` if `c` is not 2.***
