Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` retain their initial values. The variable `v` will be -1 (since the loop decrements `v` from `na_frente` down to -1). The variable `total` will be the sum of the minimum costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0, considering the conditions within the loop. The variable `best` will be the minimum value between its initial value (10^12) and the sum of `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` that satisfies `v <= pos_final`.**

This means that after the loop completes, `total` will reflect the cumulative cost of the cheapest options chosen at each step, and `best` will hold the lowest possible cost encountered during the loop's execution, considering the specific conditions for updating `best`.
