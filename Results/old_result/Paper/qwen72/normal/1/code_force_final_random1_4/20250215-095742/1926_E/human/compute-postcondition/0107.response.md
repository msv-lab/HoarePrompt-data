The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts at least two parameters, `n` and `k`, and possibly an additional parameter `t` representing the number of test cases. Each test case involves integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the total number of test cases `t` is constrained by 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.

Since the output is not specified, I will assume the function processes these parameters and returns some result based on the relationship between `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result based on the relationship between `n` and `k` for each test case.**
