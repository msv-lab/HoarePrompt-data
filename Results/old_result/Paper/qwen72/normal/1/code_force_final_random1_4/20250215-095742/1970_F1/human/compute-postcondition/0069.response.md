Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `line` is a list of substrings with at least `len(line)` substrings, `ind` is `len(line) - 1`, `grid` contains `line` as its last element. For each index `k` in `range(len(line))`, if `line[k]` is not equal to '..': `elements` contains a key-value pair where the key is `line[k]` and the value is `(0, k)`. If `line[k]` is a player, `allPlayers` contains a key-value pair where the key is `line[k]` and the value is `False`. If `line[k]` is not a player and the second character of `line[k]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[k]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` contains a list of tuples `(0, k)` for all such `k`. If any `line[k]` is equal to '..', the state for that `k` remains unchanged.**
