Postcondition: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers from the user input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None` except for the last element which is now `mex - ar[-1]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]` (which implies `ar[i]` is positive), then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i]`. Otherwise, `mex` remains `n`.**
