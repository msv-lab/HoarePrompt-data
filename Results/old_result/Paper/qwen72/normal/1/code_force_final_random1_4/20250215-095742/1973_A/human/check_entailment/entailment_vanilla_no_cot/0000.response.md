Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The solution provided has a logical flaw in how it calculates the maximum number of draws. Specifically, the condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:` is not accurate for determining the validity of the scores. The number of matches can be greater than 3, especially when considering that the same pair of players can play multiple times. Additionally, the formula used to calculate the number of draws (`egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`) does not correctly account for the distribution of points in a way that maximizes draws.

A more accurate approach would involve checking if the total points can be evenly divided into pairs of games (since each game, whether a win/loss or a draw, contributes 2 points to the total score). Then, the maximum number of draws can be calculated by ensuring that the remaining points (after accounting for wins) can be distributed as draws.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_wins = total_points // 2
        max_possible_wins = (p3 - p1) + (p3 - p2)
        if max_possible_wins > total_wins:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        draws = total_wins - max_possible_wins
        resultats.append(draws)
    return resultats

# Test the function with the provided test cases
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))
```

This corrected function should produce the expected output for the given test cases.
