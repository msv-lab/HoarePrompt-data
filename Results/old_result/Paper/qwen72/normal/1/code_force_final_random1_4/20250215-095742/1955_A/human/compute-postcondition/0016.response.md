Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers provided by the user input and each is greater than 0, `X` is `A // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `X` is calculated as the integer division of `A` by 2. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `B`, and `C`) remain unchanged.
