To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

- The loop `for i in range(k):` will execute if `k` is greater than 0.
- The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 with each iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2 or `k + 1` (this needs to be adjusted because `i` should start at 0 for the loop to execute correctly).
- `k` is the second input integer (this should be greater than 0 for the loop to execute).

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `i` should be set to 0.
- `k` must be greater than 0.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, `cur`, `tmp`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has been reset to 0, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to be reset to 0, `cur` is 0 or a bitmask representing the characters seen so far in the current sequence, `tmp` is an empty string, and `cnt` is less than `n`**
