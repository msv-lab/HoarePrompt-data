You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Program:
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n_cases` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n` and prints that value. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that the program has printed the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in how it calculates the position of 1 after performing the swap operations. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the position of 1 will always be a power of 2, which is not true for all values of `n`.

Let's consider a specific example where the program fails:

- For `n = 5`, the initial array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- Performing the swaps in order:
  - `swap(2)`: `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]`
  - `swap(3)`: `[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]`
  - `swap(4)`: `[2, 3, 4, 1, 5]`
  - `swap(5)`: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`

After all swaps, the array is `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, and the position of 1 is 5. However, the program will output `4` because it incorrectly calculates the position based on powers of 2.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
