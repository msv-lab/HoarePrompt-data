Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `b` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is 2, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 0 (or 1 depending on the conditions described), `cnt_b[a[2]]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decreases the count of the element `a[2]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cnt_b[a[2]]` is now one less than its previous value.
