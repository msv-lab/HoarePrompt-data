Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The function `func_15` and `func_16` do not implement the logic required to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, `func_15` seems to be calculating something unrelated, and `func_16` is just calling `func_15` for each test case without implementing the correct solution. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.
