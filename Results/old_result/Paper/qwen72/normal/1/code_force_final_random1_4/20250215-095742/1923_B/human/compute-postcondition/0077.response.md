Postcondition: ***`rest` is `k - 3 * delta`, `pos` is the index of the next monster in `sorted_indices` with health greater than 0 and must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `pos` is incremented by 1, and `delta` is updated to the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos - 1]]`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos - 1]]` is reduced by `delta`. Otherwise, `delta` is updated to the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`. All other variables remain unchanged.***
