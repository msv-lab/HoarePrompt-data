Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing three elements, the first being the result of `func_1(a, b)` from the initial state, the second being the new result of `func_1(a, b)` after updating `a` and `b` with new integer values from user input, and the third being the new result of `func_1(a, b)` after updating `a` and `b` (which is also stored in `winner`), `a` and `b` are now updated with new integer values from user input, `winner` is the new result of `func_1(a, b)` after updating `a` and `b`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
- The list `results` retains its structure and content, with the third element being the new result of `func_1(a, b)` after updating `a` and `b`.
- The variables `a` and `b` are updated with new integer values from user input.
- The variable `winner` is assigned the new result of `func_1(a, b)` after updating `a` and `b`.
