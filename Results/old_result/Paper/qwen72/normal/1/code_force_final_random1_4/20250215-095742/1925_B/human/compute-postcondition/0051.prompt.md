Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an input integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an input integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, and `ans` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    if x % i == 0:
        if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
            ans = max(ans, i)
        if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //
            i) == 0:
            ans = max(ans, x // i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *The loop will execute if `x` is at least 1. The initial value of `i` in the loop head is 1. If `x % i == 0`, and if `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If `x % i != 0`, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` remains less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`. If `x % i == 0`, and if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its original value and the current value of `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1 and remains less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`. If `x % i == 0` and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the new value of `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
