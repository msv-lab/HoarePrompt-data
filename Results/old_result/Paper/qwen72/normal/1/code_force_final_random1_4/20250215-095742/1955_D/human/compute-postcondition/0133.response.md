Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than `m`. The element at index 0 of list `a` is in the set `b_values`, and the count of this element in `cnt_b` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` has been decreased by 1. If the element at index `i + m` of list `a` is in the set `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` has been decremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` has been increased by 1. The current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
