Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, updated by `func_7()`, `i` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \(i^2 > n + i\), `ans` is the sum of \((n + k) // (k^2)\) for all integers \(k\) from 1 to \(i-1\) where \(i\) is the smallest integer such that \(i^2 > n + i\).**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These remain as positive integers within the given range, and they may have been updated by `func_7()`. The loop does not modify these variables directly.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be the smallest integer such that \(i^2 > n + i\). This means the loop stops just before this condition becomes false.
- **`ans`**: The variable `ans` accumulates the value of \((n + k) // (k^2)\) for each iteration \(k\) from 1 to \(i-1\), where \(i\) is the smallest integer such that \(i^2 > n + i\).

This final state reflects the complete execution of the loop, where `i` has been incremented until the condition \(i^2 > n + i\) is met, and `ans` has been updated with the sum of the specified expressions for each iteration.
