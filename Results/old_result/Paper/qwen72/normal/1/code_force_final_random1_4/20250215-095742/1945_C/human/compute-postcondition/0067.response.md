Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`. If `n` is even, `pk` is set to `n / 2`; if `n` is odd, `pk` is also set to `n / 2`. `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in `sl`. `mini` is the minimum value among the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. `i` is `n - 2`. `zero` is the number of '0's encountered in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's encountered in the first `n-1` characters of `s`. `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - (n - 1) - 1)`. `lst` contains the indices (1-based) where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50. `final` is sorted in ascending order and contains all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, and the length of `final` is 1. Additionally, `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, and `final` now includes the value 0.**
