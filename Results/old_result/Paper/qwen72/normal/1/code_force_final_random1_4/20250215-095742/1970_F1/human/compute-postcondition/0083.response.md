Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `line` is the list of substrings read from standard input and must have at least 1 element, `ind` is 0, `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` contains key-value pairs for non-'..' substrings in the new `line`, including the first element of `line` mapped to `(1, 0)`, `allPlayers` contains key-value pairs for player substrings in the new `line`. If `line[ind]` is a player substring, the value for this player substring in `allPlayers` is set to `False`. If `line[ind]` is not a player substring and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', `tmp` is set to 1 and `goal[1]` now includes the tuple `(1, 0)`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged. `goal` contains lists of tuples for substrings ending in 'G' in the new `line`, and the first element of `line` (i.e., `line[0]`) is not equal to '..'.***
