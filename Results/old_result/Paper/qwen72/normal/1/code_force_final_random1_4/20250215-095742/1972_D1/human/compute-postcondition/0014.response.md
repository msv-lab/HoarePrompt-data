Output State: **The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of \((n + k) // (k^2)\) for all integers \(k\) from 1 to \(i-1\), and \(i\) is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \(i^2 > n + i\).** 

In simpler terms, the program calculates the sum of \((n + k) // (k^2)\) for each integer \(k\) from 1 up to but not including \(i\), where \(i\) is the smallest integer greater than 1 that satisfies the condition \(i^2 > n + i\). It then subtracts 1 from this sum and returns the result.
