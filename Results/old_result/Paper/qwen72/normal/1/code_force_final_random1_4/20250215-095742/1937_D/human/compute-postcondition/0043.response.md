Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is `[0]`, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1.**

The code appends the value `0` to the list `B`, which was initially empty. All other variables remain unchanged.
