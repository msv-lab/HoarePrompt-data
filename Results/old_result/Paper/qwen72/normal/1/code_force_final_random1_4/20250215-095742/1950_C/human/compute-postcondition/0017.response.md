Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1441.
   - `s` is a new user-provided string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".
   - `h` is the substring of the new `s` from index 0 to 1 (inclusive), which is the first two characters of `s`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(h, end='')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `s` is a string in the format "hh:mm", where "hh" represents hours and "mm" represents minutes.
   - The variable `h` is the substring of `s` from index 0 to 1 (inclusive), which means it will contain the first two characters of `s`.
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `h` without a newline character at the end (due to `end=''`).

4. **Output:**
   - Since `h` is the first two characters of `s`, and `s` is in the format "hh:mm", `h` will be the hour part of the time string.
   - For example, if `s` is "12:34", then `h` will be "12".

Therefore, the output will be the first two characters of the string `s`.

Output: **hh (where hh is the first two characters of the string s)**
