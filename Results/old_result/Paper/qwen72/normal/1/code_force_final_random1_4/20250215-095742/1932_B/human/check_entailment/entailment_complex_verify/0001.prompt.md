You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of signs. a is a list of n integers, where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the periodicity of each sign.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        year = 0
        
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        
        print(year)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 0, `n` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `a` is a list of integers with exactly `n` elements, `year` is the sum of the elements in the list `a` where each element `ai` contributes either `ai` or `year % ai` if `year % ai` is non-zero for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates a value `year` by iterating over the list `a`, adding either the current element `ai` or the remainder of `year` divided by `ai` (if non-zero) to `year`. The function prints the calculated `year` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes `t` being reduced to 0, `n` and `a` being updated for each test case, and `year` being the calculated value for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the year when the nth sign occurs, given that each sign \(i\) occurs every \(a_i\) years.
   - The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the next sign can only start occurring after the previous sign has occurred.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs \(n\) and the periodicities \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\).
   - It initializes `year` to 0.
   - For each periodicity \(a_i\), it updates `year` using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`.

3. **Breaking Down the Expression:**
   - `year % ai` computes the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`.
   - If `year % ai` is 0, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, so the next occurrence of the sign is exactly `ai` years later.
   - If `year % ai` is not 0, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, so the next occurrence of the sign is `ai - (year % ai)` years later.
   - The expression `year += year % ai or ai` effectively adds the smallest number of years needed to reach the next multiple of `ai`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic correctly ensures that each sign occurs sequentially.
   - The expression `year += year % ai or ai` correctly calculates the next year when the sign occurs.
   - The solution handles the sequential nature of the signs and the periodicity correctly.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution works for the edge case where all periodicities are 1.
   - It also works for the general case where periodicities are different and can be large.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
