The only object in the loop head is the result of the function call `func_10()`. For the loop to execute one more time, the function `func_10()` must return a positive integer that is greater than 0. Since no variables are modified and the return value of `func_15()` is printed to the standard output, the state of the program outside the loop head remains unchanged.

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the function `func_10()` must still return a positive integer. However, since the loop variable `_` is not used and does not affect the loop's execution, it does not need to be explicitly mentioned in the state.

State: **The return value of `func_15()` is printed to the standard output, and no variables are modified. The condition that `func_10()` must return a positive integer for the loop to execute remains unchanged.**
