### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one. It reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game.
   - The initial condition checks if the smallest pile size is not 1. If it is not 1, Alice can always win by removing all stones from the smallest pile, making the game trivial for her. This is correct.
   - The program then converts the pile sizes to a set to remove duplicates and sorts them. This is done to check the differences between consecutive pile sizes.
   - The loop iterates through the sorted set and checks if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1. If it is, the game is not continuous, and the variable `A` is toggled.
   - If the game is continuous (all differences are 1), the variable `A` is toggled again.
   - Finally, the function returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True`, otherwise 'Bob'.

3. **Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The logic for determining the winner is based on the idea that if the smallest pile is not 1, Alice can always win by removing all stones from the smallest pile.
   - If the smallest pile is 1, the game becomes more complex. The program checks if the differences between consecutive pile sizes are all 1. If they are, the game is continuous, and the winner depends on the parity of the number of piles. If the differences are not all 1, the game is not continuous, and the winner also depends on the parity of the number of piles.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when the smallest pile is 1 and when the differences between consecutive pile sizes are not all 1.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and constraints. The input handling and the logic within the `func_1` function are correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
