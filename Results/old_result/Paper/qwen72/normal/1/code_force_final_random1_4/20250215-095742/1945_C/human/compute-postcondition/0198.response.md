Postcondition: ***`mini` will be the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`, `ele` is the second element in `lst`, `lst` must have at least two elements. If `abs(pk - elem)` is equal to `mini`, `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst` and `elem`. Otherwise, `final` is an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.***
