Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the promotion price for two yogurts is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually, but the total number of yogurts is odd. In such a case, the optimal solution would be to buy as many pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and then buy the last yogurt at the regular price. However, the current implementation incorrectly calculates the cost for odd numbers of yogurts in some scenarios.

For example, consider the input `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 8`:
- The program will output `13` because it calculates `1 * 8 + 5`.
- However, the correct output should be `15` because buying three yogurts individually at 5 burles each is cheaper than buying one pair at 8 burles and one at 5 burles.
