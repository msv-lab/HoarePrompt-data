Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 1, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the string `s` with `char` inserted at index 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `len(unique_chars)`, and `char` is now in `unique_chars`.** 

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, making `j` equal to the length of `unique_chars`. All other variables remain unchanged.
