The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user, where `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`. It then calls another function `func_1` with `a` and `b` as arguments and stores the result in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list `results`. The final state of the program is that `results` contains `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1(a, b)` for the corresponding test case, and the values of `a` and `b` are the last set of integers provided by the user.
