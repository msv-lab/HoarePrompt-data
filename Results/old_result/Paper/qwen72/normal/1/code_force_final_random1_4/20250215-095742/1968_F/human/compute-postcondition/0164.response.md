Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `q` is 0, `idx` has been incremented by `2 * q_initial` (where `q_initial` is the initial value of `q`), `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, followed by an additional empty string. The values of `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` are no longer relevant as they are re-initialized in each iteration.**
