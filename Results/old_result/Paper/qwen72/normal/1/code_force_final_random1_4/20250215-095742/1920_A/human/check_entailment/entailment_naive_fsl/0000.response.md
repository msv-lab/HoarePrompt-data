Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly handles the constraints as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The variables `start` and `end` are initialized to `-1` and `1000000000.0` respectively. These represent the minimum and maximum possible values for `k` based on the constraints.

2. **Reading Constraints**: The program reads `n` constraints and updates `start` and `end` accordingly:
   - For type 1 constraints (`k >= x`), `start` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
   - For type 2 constraints (`k <= x`), `end` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
   - For type 3 constraints (`k != x`), the value `x` is added to the list `num`.

3. **Counting Invalid Values**: The program counts how many values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`. This is necessary because these values are explicitly excluded by the type 3 constraints.

4. **Final Calculation**: The program calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the count of invalid values from the total number of integers in the range `[start, end]`. If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns 0, indicating no valid integers.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases such as when `start` is greater than `end` (returning 0) and when there are no invalid values in the range (returning the full range size).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
