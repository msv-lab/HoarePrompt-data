Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, the second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the user input and must have at least `x` elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations of the loop plus the value of `y`, `tmp` contains the values added during the loop execution.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans += y` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `y`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `tt`, `ii`, `a`, `i`, `tmp`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `ans` is the sum of its previous value (after all iterations of the loop) and the value of `y`.
