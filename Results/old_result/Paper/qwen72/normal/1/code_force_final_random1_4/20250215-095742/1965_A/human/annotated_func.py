    #State: *`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `A` is False, and the first element of `arr` is 1

    #State: `arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, the first element of `arr` is 1, `set_` is a sorted list containing unique elements from `arr` in ascending order, `not_c` is False, `A` is either True or False depending on the final value of `i` (if the loop completes without breaking, `A` will be the opposite of its initial value based on the number of iterations), and `i` is the last index the loop iterated over, which is `len(set_) - 1` if the loop completes without breaking.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: *`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, the first element of `arr` is 1, `set_` is a sorted list containing unique elements from `arr` in ascending order, `not_c` is False, and `A` is the opposite of its initial value. If `not_c` is False, `i` is the last index the loop iterated over, which is `len(set_) - 1` if the loop completes without breaking.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'. Given that `A` is the opposite of its initial value and `not_c` is False, `A` would be True, so the program returns 'Alice'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `arr` and determines the winner of a game between Alice and Bob. The game rules are not explicitly defined in the code, but based on the logic, if the first element of `arr` is not 1, the function immediately returns 'Alice'. Otherwise, it checks the differences between consecutive unique elements in the sorted version of `arr`. If any difference is greater than 1, the function returns 'Alice'. If all differences are 1, the function toggles a boolean flag `A` and returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise 'Bob'. In all cases, the function returns either 'Alice' or 'Bob'.
