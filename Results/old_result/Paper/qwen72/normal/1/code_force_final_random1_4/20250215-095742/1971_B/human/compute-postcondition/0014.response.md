Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is an input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the string `s`, the number of unique characters in `a` is not equal to 2, `b` is a sorted string of `s`, and `c` is a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in descending order. If `b` (the sorted version of `s`) is equal to `s`, then `s` is already sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, `b` is not equal to `s`.***
