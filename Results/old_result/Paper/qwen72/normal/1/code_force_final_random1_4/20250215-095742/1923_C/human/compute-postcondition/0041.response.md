To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `m` is greater than 1 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `i` is defined as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is defined as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

### Condition:
- If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then the condition is met.
- Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` checks if the range between `a` and `b` (inclusive) contains more than one element.
   - The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` checks if the difference between `s` and the length of the range is greater than or equal to `i`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The code snippet only contains a `print('YES')` statement.
   - This means that if the condition is met, the program will print 'YES'.
   - If the condition is not met, the program does not print anything (since there is no else block).

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the condition, the `print('YES')` statement will execute if the condition is met. Since the condition is described as being met if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the output will be 'YES' if these conditions are satisfied.

Output: **YES (if the condition `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is met)**
