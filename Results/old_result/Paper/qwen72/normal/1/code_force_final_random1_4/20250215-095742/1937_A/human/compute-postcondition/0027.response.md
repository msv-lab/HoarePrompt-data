To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `power < n`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `i` is 1
- `n_cases` is greater than 1
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the new input integer
- `power` is 1

The loop condition is `power < n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `power` must be less than `n`.

- `power` is 1.
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the new input integer.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `power` is 1). The base-2 logarithm of an integer is greater than 1 if the integer is greater than 2 (since \( \log_2(2) = 1 \)).

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once, the new input integer must be greater than 2, making `n` greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the new input integer and must be greater than 1, `power` is 1**
