The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 (so `j` becomes 3) and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3. If `xx[i][1]` is not '?', `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][1]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus the string 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is set to 'F'.**
