Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least three tuples. `p1` is the first element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, and `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` is a list containing one element, which is -1, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` is a list containing one more element, which is -1. Otherwise, if `total_points` is even and `total_matchs` is 3 or less and `p3` is not greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is updated to include the value `egalites // 2`.***
