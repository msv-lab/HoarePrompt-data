Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a flaw in its logic for determining whether it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. Specifically, the conditions under which the variable `impossible` is set to `False` are too restrictive and do not correctly handle all scenarios where making the entire grid one color is possible.

The core issue is that the code only checks the first and last rows and columns for adjacent cells being different colors. This approach fails to consider other configurations that could still allow the entire grid to be turned into a single color through the allowed operations.

A more robust approach would involve checking if there exists at least one row or column that is entirely of one color, or if the grid can be divided into two parts such that all cells in one part are of one color and all cells in the other part are of another color, which would then allow the entire grid to be colored uniformly.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect for the problem described.
