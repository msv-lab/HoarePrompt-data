Output State: **`n` must be at least 10, `m` must be at least 15, `x` is 2, `y` is 3, `cnt` is the initial value of `cnt` plus `min(n / 10, m // 15)` if `math.gcd(2, 3) == 1`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n` must be at least 10, `m` must be at least 15, `x` is 2, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is the initial value of `cnt` plus `min(n / 12, m // 12)` if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged.
- The code snippet updates `cnt` by adding `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.
- Since `x` is 2 and `y` is 3, `(x + y) * x` equals 10 and `(x + y) * y` equals 15.
- The condition `math.gcd(2, 3) == 1` is true, so `cnt` is updated.
- Therefore, `cnt` is now the initial value of `cnt` plus `min(n / 10, m // 15)`.
