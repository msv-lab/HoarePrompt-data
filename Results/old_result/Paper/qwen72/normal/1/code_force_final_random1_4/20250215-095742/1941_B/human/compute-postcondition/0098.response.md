Let's break down the initial state and the operations described to determine what will be printed by the `print('NO')` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `numTest` is `t - 1`.
- `_` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `a` is a list of integers from the new input.
- `i` is 1.
- `opNum` is `a[0]`.
- `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - opNum`.
- `a[1]` through `a[n-3]` are set to 0.
- `a[n-2]` is updated to `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`.
- `a[n-1]` is updated to `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`.
- `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] - sum of opNums from 0 to i`.
- `a[i + 1]` is updated to `a[i + 1] - (sum of 2 * opNums from 0 to i + 1) - 2 * opNum`.
- `a[i + 2]` is updated to `a[i + 2] - sum of opNums from 0 to i + 2 - opNum`.
- `stop` remains False unless `a[0]` is less than 0.

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Updates:**
   - `opNum` is set to `a[0]`.
   - `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - opNum`, which means `a[0]` becomes 0.
   - `a[1]` through `a[n-3]` are set to 0.
   - `a[n-2]` is updated to `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`, but since `a[n-3]` is 0, `a[n-2]` remains unchanged.
   - `a[n-1]` is updated to `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`, but since `a[n-3]` is 0, `a[n-1]` remains unchanged.
   - `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) is updated to `a[1] - sum of opNums from 0 to 1`. Since `a[1]` is 0 and `opNum` is `a[0]`, this results in `a[1] = 0 - opNum = -opNum`.
   - `a[i + 1]` (which is `a[2]`) is updated to `a[2] - (sum of 2 * opNums from 0 to 2) - 2 * opNum`. Since `a[2]` is 0 and `opNum` is `a[0]`, this results in `a[2] = 0 - (2 * opNum + 2 * opNum) - 2 * opNum = -6 * opNum`.
   - `a[i + 2]` (which is `a[3]`) is updated to `a[3] - sum of opNums from 0 to 3 - opNum`. Since `a[3]` is 0 and `opNum` is `a[0]`, this results in `a[3] = 0 - (opNum + opNum + opNum) - opNum = -4 * opNum`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - `stop` remains False unless `a[0]` is less than 0. Since `a[0]` is set to 0, `stop` remains False.

### Conclusion:
The `print('NO')` statement will always print 'NO' because the condition for `stop` being True (i.e., `a[0] < 0`) is not met.

Output: **NO**
