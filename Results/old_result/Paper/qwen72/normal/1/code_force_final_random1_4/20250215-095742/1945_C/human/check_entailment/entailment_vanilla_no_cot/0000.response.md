Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `pk`**: The variable `pk` is supposed to represent the midpoint of the village, but the calculation is incorrect. It should be `pk = n // 2` to get the integer part of the midpoint.

2. **Unnecessary Percentage Calculations**: The code calculates percentages (`zero_perc` and `one_perc`) which are not necessary for the problem. The problem requires checking if at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied, not the percentage.

3. **Incorrect Condition for Satisfaction**: The conditions `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` are not the correct way to check if at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. Instead, you should check if the number of satisfied residents is at least `ceil((i + 1) / 2)` for the left side and `ceil((n - i - 1) / 2)` for the right side.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not handle the edge cases where the road should be laid before the first house or after the last house correctly. Specifically, the logic for appending `0` or `n` to the `final` list is flawed.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        
        # Initialize prefix sums for 0s and 1s
        prefix_zeros = [0] * (n + 1)
        prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for i in range(n):
            prefix_zeros[i + 1] = prefix_zeros[i] + (s[i] == '0')
            prefix_ones[i + 1] = prefix_ones[i] + (s[i] == '1')
        
        best_i = -1
        min_diff = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n):
            left_zeros = prefix_zeros[i]
            left_ones = i - left_zeros
            right_zeros = prefix_zeros[n] - prefix_zeros[i]
            right_ones = (n - i) - right_zeros
            
            left_satisfied = left_zeros >= math.ceil((i) / 2)
            right_satisfied = right_ones >= math.ceil((n - i) / 2)
            
            if left_satisfied and right_satisfied:
                diff = abs(n // 2 - i)
                if diff < min_diff:
                    min_diff = diff
                    best_i = i
        
        if best_i == -1:
            # If no valid position found, check edge cases
            if prefix_ones[n] >= math.ceil(n / 2):
                best_i = 0
            else:
                best_i = n
        
        print(best_i)

func()
```

This corrected version uses prefix sums to efficiently calculate the number of zeros and ones on both sides of the road for each possible position. It then checks the satisfaction conditions and finds the optimal position that minimizes the distance to the midpoint.
