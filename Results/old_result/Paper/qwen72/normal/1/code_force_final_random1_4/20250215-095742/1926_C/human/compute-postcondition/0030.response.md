Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` remains an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 2 Â· 10^5, `N` is 200001, and `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `N-1` is the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`. The loop variable `i` will be equal to `N` (which is 200001).**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The input integer `t` and the integer `n` remain unchanged.
- The list `pd` now contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i` for each index `i` from 1 to 200000.
- The loop variable `i` will have reached the value 200001, which is the upper limit of the loop range.
