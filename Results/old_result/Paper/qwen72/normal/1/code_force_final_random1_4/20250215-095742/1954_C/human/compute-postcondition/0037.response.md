Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input. If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, then `new` is a list where each element is `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`, and `new2` is a list where each element is `max(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`, and `i` is equal to `len(a)`. Otherwise, `new` and `new2` remain unchanged, and `i` is the index where `a[i] != b[i]` or the length of `a` if all elements are equal.***
