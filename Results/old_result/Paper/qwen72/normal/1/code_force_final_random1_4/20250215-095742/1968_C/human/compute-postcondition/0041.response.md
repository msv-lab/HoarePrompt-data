The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it seems the function should accept parameters that define the number of test cases (`t`) and for each test case, the number of elements (`n`) and the elements themselves (`x_2, ..., x_n`). Given the constraints, the function likely processes these inputs and returns some result based on the values provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) and a list of integers `x_2, ..., x_n` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500). It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
