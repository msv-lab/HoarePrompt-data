### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function initializes `cnt_b` as a list of zeros with a size of `max_val + 1` to keep track of the frequency of elements in `b`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.

2. **Reading Test Case Data:**
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the elements of array `a` and array `b`.

3. **Counting Elements in `b`:**
   - It updates the `cnt_b` list to count the occurrences of each element in `b`.

4. **Initial Window Check:**
   - It initializes a variable `curr` to count the number of elements in the first window of size `m` of array `a` that match the elements in `b`.
   - It decrements the count in `cnt_b` for each element in the initial window and checks if the count is non-negative to update `curr`.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

5. **Sliding Window:**
   - It uses a sliding window approach to check all subarrays of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each new element added to the window, it updates `cnt_b` and `curr` accordingly.
   - For each element removed from the window, it also updates `cnt_b` and `curr` accordingly.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

6. **Resetting Counts:**
   - After processing each test case, it resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b` to zero.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initial Window Check:**
  - The initial window check is correct. It correctly counts the number of elements in the first window of size `m` that match the elements in `b` and updates `curr` accordingly.
  - The condition `if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0` ensures that only elements that are still needed to match `b` are counted.

- **Sliding Window:**
  - The sliding window approach is implemented correctly. It efficiently updates the counts and the current count of matching elements (`curr`) as the window slides through the array `a`.
  - The conditions `if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0` and `if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0` ensure that the counts are updated correctly when elements are added or removed from the window.

- **Resetting Counts:**
  - The counts in `cnt_b` are reset correctly after each test case, ensuring that the next test case starts with a clean slate.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the sliding window technique to count the number of good subarrays. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately. The logic for counting and updating the elements in the sliding window is correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final: True**
