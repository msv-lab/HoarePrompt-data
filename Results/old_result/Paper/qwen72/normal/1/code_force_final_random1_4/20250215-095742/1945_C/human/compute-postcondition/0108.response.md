Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 3`, `zero` is `zero`, `one` is `one`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, and `lst` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `zero_perc` is updated to `zero * 100 // 3` because `i` is 2, so `i + 1` is 3.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `zero`, `one`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged.
- The condition for updating `lst` is not evaluated in this code snippet, so `lst` remains unchanged.
