You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        score = 0
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        print(score)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the smaller number in each pair of consecutive numbers from the sorted list and prints this sum. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the printed scores for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it works for every potential case:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, the program sorts the list of integers `l`. Sorting ensures that the smallest elements are considered first, which is crucial for maximizing the score.
3. **Score Calculation**: The program iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the smaller of each pair to the score. Since the list is sorted, the element at index `i` (where `i` is even) is always the smaller of the pair `(l[i], l[i+1])`.
4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated score for each test case.

### Why It Works:
- **Optimal Pairing**: By sorting the list, the program ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, which maximizes the sum of the minimum values of each pair.
- **Correct Iteration**: The loop `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2)` correctly iterates over the pairs of elements, ensuring that all elements are used exactly once.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `n` is 1 or when all elements are the same. In these cases, the sorted list and the pairing logic still produce the correct result.

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases and follows the problem description, it is considered correct.
