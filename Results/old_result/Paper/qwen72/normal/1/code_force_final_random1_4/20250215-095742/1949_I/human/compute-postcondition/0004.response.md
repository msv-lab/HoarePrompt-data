Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, and `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`.**

Explanation: The code reinitializes the `visited` list to a list of `False` values with length `n`. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, and `coef`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
