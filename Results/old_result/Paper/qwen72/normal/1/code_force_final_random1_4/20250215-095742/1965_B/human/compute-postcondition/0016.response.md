Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation:
- The code `bk = bin(k)[2:]` assigns the binary representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix) to the variable `bk`.
- The initial state remains unchanged except for the new value of `bk`.
- The conditions on `n` and `k` remain valid, and `b` and `l` retain their original values.
