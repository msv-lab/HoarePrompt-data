Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `numTest` is `t - 1`, `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is now a list of integers from the new input, `i` is 2, `opNum` is `a[2]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - a[1]`, `a[1]` through `a[n-3]` are 0, `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - 2 * opNum - sum of opNums from 0 to i`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - (sum of 2 * opNums from 0 to i + 1) - 2 * a[1] - 2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - sum of opNums from 0 to i + 2 - a[1] - opNum`. If `a[i]` is less than 0, `stop` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stop` remains `False`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[i] -= opNum` updates the value of `a[i]` by subtracting `opNum` from it.
- Since `i` is 2, `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] - opNum`.
- The previous value of `a[2]` was `a[2] - opNum - sum of opNums from 0 to i`, so after the update, `a[2]` becomes `a[2] - 2 * opNum - sum of opNums from 0 to i`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
