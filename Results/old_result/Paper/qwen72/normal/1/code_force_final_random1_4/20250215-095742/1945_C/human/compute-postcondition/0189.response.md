Output State: **`lst` must contain at least three indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%`, `ele` is the third element in `lst`, `mini` is now the minimum of its original value and `abs(pk - ele)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `mini` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.
- The values of `lst`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `ele` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `lst` must contain at least three indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50% remains valid.
- `ele` is still the third element in `lst`.
- `mini` is now the minimum of its original value and `abs(pk - ele)`.
