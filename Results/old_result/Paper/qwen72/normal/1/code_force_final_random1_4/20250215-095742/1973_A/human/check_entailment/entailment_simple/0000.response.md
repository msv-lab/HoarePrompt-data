Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**: The program correctly handles the input validation by ensuring that the total points are even. This is necessary because each game (whether it ends in a win/loss or a draw) contributes an even number of points to the total score. If the total points are odd, it's impossible to achieve the given scores, and the program correctly appends `-1` to the results.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**: The program calculates the total number of matches as `total_matchs = total_points // 2`. This is correct because each match (regardless of the outcome) contributes 2 points to the total score.

3. **Feasibility Check**: The program checks if the total number of matches is greater than 3 or if the highest score (`p3`) is greater than the total number of matches. This is a valid check because:
   - If the total number of matches is greater than 3, it implies more games were played than possible with only three players.
   - If the highest score (`p3`) is greater than the total number of matches, it means a player has more points than the total number of games played, which is impossible.

4. **Draw Calculation**: The program calculates the number of draws as `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This formula is derived from the fact that:
   - `2 * (p3 - p2)` represents the points gained by the highest scorer over the second-highest scorer through wins.
   - `2 * (p3 - p1)` represents the points gained by the highest scorer over the lowest scorer through wins.
   - Subtracting these from the total points gives the remaining points, which must be due to draws.

5. **Final Check and Result**: The program checks if the calculated number of draws (`egalites`) is negative. If it is, it appends `-1` to the results, indicating an invalid scenario. Otherwise, it appends `egalites // 2` to the results, which is the number of draws.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to handle all edge cases and correctly computes the maximum number of draws or returns `-1` when the scores are inconsistent.

Correctness: **True**
