Output State: **`i` is `n - m - 1`, `n` is greater than `m`, `m` remains the same as the input integer, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`, the values of `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, `b_values` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `b`. For each `i` from 0 to `n - m - 1`, if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0 after incrementing, `curr` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `cnt_b[a[i]]` remains unchanged and `curr` remains the same. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is increased by 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `n - m - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n - m - 1`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- The `cnt_b` dictionary is updated based on the presence of elements in `b_values`.
- The variable `curr` is adjusted based on the changes in `cnt_b` for elements in `b_values`.
- The variable `ans` is incremented whenever `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` during any iteration of the loop.
