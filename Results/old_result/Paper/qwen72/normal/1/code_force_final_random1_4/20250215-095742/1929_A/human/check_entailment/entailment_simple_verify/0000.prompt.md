You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ntest` must be equal to the initial value of `ntest`, `itest` is `ntest - 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program sorts the array and then prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements (`a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`). However, this approach does not consider the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`, which is required to calculate the maximum beauty.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
3
2 1 3
```
The expected output is `2` because the sorted array `[1, 2, 3]` has a beauty of `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`. However, the program will output `2` because it only calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is `3 - 1 = 2`.

While the output is correct in this specific case, the program's logic is flawed and will fail for other inputs. For example:

### Another Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
4
3 4 3 3
```
The expected output is `1` because the sorted array `[3, 3, 3, 4]` has a beauty of `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 1`. However, the program will output `1` because it only calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is `4 - 3 = 1`.

This approach fails to correctly compute the sum of differences for all pairs of adjacent elements, leading to incorrect results in many cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
