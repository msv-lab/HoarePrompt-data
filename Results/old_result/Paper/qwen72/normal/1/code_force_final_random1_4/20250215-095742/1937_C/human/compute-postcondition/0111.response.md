Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is a placeholder (its value is not relevant for this task).
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `res` is the new input string.
   - If `res` is `<`, then `k` is 1 and `best` is 2.
   - Otherwise, `k` is 1 and `best` is 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `k` is always 1, regardless of the value of `res`.
   - `best` depends on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is `<`, then `best` is 2.
     - Otherwise, `best` is 0.
   - `i` is 3.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with `?`, followed by the values of `k`, `best`, `k`, and `i`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `res` is `<`, the output will be: `? 1 2 1 3`.
   - Otherwise, the output will be: `? 1 0 1 3`.

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both cases:

- If `res` is `<`:
  Output: **? 1 2 1 3**

- Otherwise:
  Output: **? 1 0 1 3**

To provide the most precise description possible based on the precondition, we will consider both cases:

Output: **? 1 [best] 1 3 (where [best] is 2 if res is '<', otherwise [best] is 0)**
