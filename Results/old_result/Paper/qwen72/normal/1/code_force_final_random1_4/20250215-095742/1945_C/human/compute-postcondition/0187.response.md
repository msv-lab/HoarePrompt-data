Output State: **`lst` must contain at least two indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%`, `ele` is the second element in `lst`, `mini` is now the minimum of its original value and `abs(pk - ele)`**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `lst` must contain at least two indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%. This condition remains unchanged.
- `ele` is the second element in `lst`, which also remains unchanged.
- The code updates `mini` to be the minimum of its original value and `abs(pk - ele)`. The new value of `mini` is the smaller of these two values. Therefore, `mini` is now the minimum of its original value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.
