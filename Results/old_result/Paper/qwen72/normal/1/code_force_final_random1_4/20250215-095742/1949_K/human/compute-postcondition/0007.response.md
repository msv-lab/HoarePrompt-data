The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `numbers`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers`. If there are more elements in `numbers`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the second element in `numbers`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be the next (third) element in `numbers`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order where 1 ≤ `numbers[i]` ≤ 10^9, `group_a` is `[numbers[0]]`, `group_b` is `[numbers[1]]`, `group_c` remains an empty list, `sum_a` is `numbers[0]`, `sum_b` is `numbers[1]`, `sum_c` remains 0, `num` is the third element in `numbers`.**
