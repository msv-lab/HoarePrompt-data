Postcondition: ***`i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the second element of `odd`, `odd` is a non-empty list of integers (sorted in ascending order), `even` is a list of integers (sorted in ascending order). If `y` < `gap // 2`, `ans` is increased by `2 * y`, `y` is set to 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
