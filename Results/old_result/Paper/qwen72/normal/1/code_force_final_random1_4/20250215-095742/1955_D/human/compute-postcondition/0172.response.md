The code snippet `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the value at the index `b[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, and `m` must be greater than 0, the value at `b[0]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1.**
