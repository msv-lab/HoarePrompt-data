Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of 'F' at index `j - 1` in the string `x`, and `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of 'S' at index `j - 1` in the string `x`. The element at index 2 of `a` is incremented by the total number of 'F' characters in `x`, and the element at index 2 of `b` is incremented by the total number of 'S' characters in `x`. The list `xx` now contains two strings, the original user input string `x` and the same user input string `x` appended again. The variable `j` is `n + 1`. `x` is a new user input string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if x[j - 1] == 'F':
        a[i] += 1
        a[j] += 1
    elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
        b[i] += 1
        b[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of 'F' at index `j - 1` in the string `x`, and the element at index 2 of `a` is incremented by the total number of 'F' characters in `x`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of 'S' at index `j - 1` in the string `x`, and the element at index 2 of `b` is incremented by the total number of 'S' characters in `x`, `xx` now contains two strings, the original user input string `x` and the same user input string `x` appended again, `j` is `n + 1`, `x` is a new user input string. If the character at index `j - 1` in `x` is 'F', then `a[3]` and `a[j]` are incremented by 1. If the character at index `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', then `b[3]` and `b[j]` are incremented by 1. If the character at index `j - 1` in `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', then no changes are made to `a` or `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of 'F' at index `j - 1` in the string `x`, and the element at index 2 of `a` is incremented by the total number of 'F' characters in `x`. `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of 'S' at index `j - 1` in the string `x`, and the element at index 2 of `b` is incremented by the total number of 'S' characters in `x`. `xx` now contains two strings, the original user input string `x` and the same user input string `x` appended again, `j` is 4, `x` is a new user input string. If `x[3]` is 'F', then the elements at index 3 and 4 of `a` are each incremented by 1. If `x[3]` is 'S', then the elements at index 3 and 4 of `b` are each incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of 'F' at index `j - 1` in the string `x`, and the element at index 2 of `a` is incremented by the total number of 'F' characters in `x`. `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of 'S' at index `j - 1` in the string `x`, and the element at index 2 of `b` is incremented by the total number of 'S' characters in `x`. `xx` contains two strings, the original user input string `x` and the same user input string `x` appended again, `j` is 5, `x` is a new user input string. If `x[3]` is 'F', then the elements at index 3 and 4 of `a` are each incremented by 1. If `x[3]` is 'S', then the elements at index 3 and 5 of `b` are each incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
