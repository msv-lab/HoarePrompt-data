Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are updated to the values provided by the user input (with 1 <= x <= 10^8 and 1 <= n <= x), `q` is 0, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, and `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` such that `x - n * d` is non-negative and divisible by `d`, where `d` is a divisor of `x`. If no such divisor exists, `ans` remains 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
- For each `i`, the loop checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` (`x % i == 0`).
- If `i` is a divisor, it further checks if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`.
- Similarly, it checks if `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `x // i`.
- If either condition is met, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the corresponding divisor (`i` or `x // i`).
- After all iterations, `i` will be `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
- The final value of `ans` will be the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the conditions, or 1 if no such divisor exists.
