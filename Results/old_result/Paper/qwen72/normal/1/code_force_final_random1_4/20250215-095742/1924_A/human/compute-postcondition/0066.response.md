The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` updates the value of `cur` by adding the value of `1` shifted left by `cur_ss` bits to the current value of `cur`. Given that `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus 97 (the ASCII value of 'a'), and the bit at position `cur_ss` in the binary representation of `cur` is initially 0, the effect of this operation is to set the bit at position `cur_ss` to 1.

Let's break down the impact:

- `cur` is updated to include the bit at position `cur_ss` set to 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, `ss`, `cur_ss`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1 or `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus 97, `cur` is the original value of `cur` with the bit at position `cur_ss` set to 1.**
