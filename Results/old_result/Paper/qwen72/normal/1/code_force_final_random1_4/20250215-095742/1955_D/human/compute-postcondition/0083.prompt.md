Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `b` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is `n - m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`. The variable `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose count in `cnt_b` is non-negative after the loop has completed. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where this condition holds true. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in b_values:
    cnt_b[i] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b_values` must contain at least one element, `i` is an element from `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b_values` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the next element from `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b_values` must contain at least three elements, `i` is the next (third) element from `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
