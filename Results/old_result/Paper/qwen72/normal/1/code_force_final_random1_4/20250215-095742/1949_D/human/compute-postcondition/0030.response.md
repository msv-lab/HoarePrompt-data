Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by 2 if the corresponding character in `x` at index `j - 1` is 'F', otherwise it remains unchanged. `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by 2 if the corresponding character in `x` at index `j - 1` is 'S', otherwise it remains unchanged. `xx` is a list containing an empty string, and `x` is a user input string.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = n`.
- For each iteration, if the character at index `j - 1` in the string `x` is 'F', the elements `a[i]` and `a[j]` are incremented by 1.
- If the character at index `j - 1` in the string `x` is 'S', the elements `b[i]` and `b[j]` are incremented by 1.
- After all iterations, the lists `a` and `b` will reflect the cumulative increments based on the characters in `x`.
- The variables `n`, `i`, `xx`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
