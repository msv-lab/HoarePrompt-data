Output State: **`custos` is a list that contains the final cost values for each of the `x` test cases, where `x` is the total number of iterations. Each element in `custos` represents the cost calculated during one iteration of the loop. The loop has printed each of these cost values exactly once.**

Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `custos` will contain the final cost values for each of the `x` test cases. Each element in the `custos` list corresponds to the cost calculated during one iteration of the loop. The loop will have printed each of these cost values exactly once, so the output will be a sequence of `x` cost values, one for each test case. The other variables mentioned in the initial state, such as `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, and `i`, will retain their values as they were at the start of each iteration, with `i` having reached the value `x-1` (the last index of the loop).
