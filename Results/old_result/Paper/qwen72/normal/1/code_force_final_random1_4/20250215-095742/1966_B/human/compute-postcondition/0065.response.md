To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop head:

```python
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `j`.
   - The loop iterates over the range `range(m - 1)`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `tc` is 1.
   - `n` is the first integer provided by the user input.
   - `m` is the second integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input from each iteration of the loop).
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `ans` is 'YES'.
   - The first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`.
   - If `gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is False, and either the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first sublist in `gr`, or the first element of the last sublist in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the last sublist in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - The only variable that can be adjusted in the loop head is `j`.
   - Since `j` is currently 1, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `j` will be 2.

5. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m - 1`.
   - Given that `m` is at least 2, `m - 1` is at least 1. Since `j` is now 2, the loop will execute again if `m` is greater than 2.

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the first integer provided by the user input, `m` is the second integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 3, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input from each iteration of the loop), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is 2, `ans` is 'YES', the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`. If `gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is False, and either the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first sublist in `gr`, or the first element of the last sublist in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the last sublist in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.**
