### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a player at position 0 on a line, with `n` monsters each having a health `a_i` and a position `x_i`.
   - Each second, the player can fire up to `k` bullets, each reducing a monster's health by 1.
   - Monsters move 1 unit closer to the player each second.
   - The player loses if any monster reaches position 0.
   - The goal is to determine if it's possible to kill all monsters before any of them reach the player.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - **Sorting by Distance**: The function `func_1` sorts the monsters by their absolute distance from the player. This ensures that the closest monsters are prioritized, which is crucial because they pose the greatest immediate threat.
   - **Distance Tracking**: The variable `distance` keeps track of the number of seconds that have passed, which is equivalent to the distance the closest monster has moved towards the player.
   - **Bullet Allocation**: The inner loop allocates up to `k` bullets to the monsters in the order of their sorted indices. If a monster's health drops to 0, it is considered dead, and we move to the next monster.
   - **Termination Condition**: The function returns `False` if any monster reaches the player (i.e., `abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`). Otherwise, it continues until all monsters are dead.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Monster**: If there is only one monster, the function correctly checks if it can be killed within its distance to the player.
   - **Multiple Monsters**: The function handles multiple monsters by ensuring that the closest monsters are prioritized and that the player has enough bullets to kill them before they reach the player.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - **Function 2**: The function `func_2` reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the result. It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.

5. **Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\), and the subsequent processing is \(O(n)\) per test case. Given the constraints, this is efficient.
   - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the storage of the monster data and the sorted indices.

### Verification of Function Summaries:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - The function sorts the monsters by their absolute distance from the player.
  - It iterates through the sorted monsters, allocating up to `k` bullets each second.
  - It checks if any monster reaches the player and returns `False` if so.
  - It returns `True` if all monsters are killed before reaching the player.
  - This matches the intended behavior described in the problem.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
  - It calls `func_1` for each test case and prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns `True`, otherwise 'NO'.
  - This matches the expected input and output handling.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters. The algorithm is sound and handles the problem constraints effectively.

**Final: **True**
