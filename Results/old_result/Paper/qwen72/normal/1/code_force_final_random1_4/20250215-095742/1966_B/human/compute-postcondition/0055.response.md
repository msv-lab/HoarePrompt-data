Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the first integer provided by the user input, `m` is the second integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input from each iteration of the loop), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, `ans` is 'YES'.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `ans` remains 'NO' if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, otherwise it remains 'YES'.
- The code snippet sets `ans` to 'YES', overriding any previous condition.
- All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
