Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 2, `t` is the first integer from the new input, `v` is the second integer from the new input, `num`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged based on their initial conditions. If `start` < `v`, then `start` is updated to be equal to `v`.***
