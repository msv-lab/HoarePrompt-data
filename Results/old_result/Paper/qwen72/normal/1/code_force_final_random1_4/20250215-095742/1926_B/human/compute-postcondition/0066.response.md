The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the problem description, it implicitly accepts multiple test cases, each containing a grid of characters ('0' or '1'). The function processes each test case to determine whether the grid contains a triangle or a square formed by '1's, with the size of the shape being greater than 1.

- **Parameters**: The function implicitly accepts a series of test cases, where each test case consists of:
  - An integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) indicating the size of the grid.
  - A grid represented by `n` lines of `n` characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'.

- **Return Value**: For each test case, the function returns a string indicating whether the grid contains a triangle or a square formed by '1's. The shape must include all '1's and have a size greater than 1.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a grid of '0's and '1's. It determines and returns whether the grid contains a triangle or a square formed by '1's, with the shape's size being greater than 1.**
