### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the original assessment step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1:** `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`
     - This condition checks if both `a` and `b` are even. If both are even, Bob can always form another rectangle by cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. This is correct.
   - **Condition 2:** `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`
     - This condition is incorrect. The expression `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` are tuples and do not serve as valid boolean conditions. The intended logic here seems to be checking if `a` or `b` is 1, but the implementation is flawed.
   - **Condition 3:** `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`
     - This condition checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd. However, it does not correctly handle all cases where Bob can form another rectangle. Specifically, it should check if either `a` or `b` is greater than 1 and the product of the dimensions is not a prime number.
   - **Else:** `else`
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'no'. This is incorrect because it does not cover all valid cases where Bob can form another rectangle.

3. **Correct Logic:**
   - Bob can form another rectangle if at least one of the dimensions (`a` or `b`) is greater than 1 and the product of the dimensions is not a prime number.
   - Specifically, if either `a` or `b` is 1, Bob cannot form another rectangle.
   - If both `a` and `b` are greater than 1, Bob can always form another rectangle by cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1 or b == 1:
            print('no')
        else:
            print('yes')
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the conditions for forming another rectangle. The corrected program checks if either dimension is 1 and prints 'no' in that case, otherwise it prints 'yes'.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
