You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. start is initialized to -1, end is initialized to 1000000000.0, and num is an empty list.
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = 1000000000.0
    num = []

        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))

    #State: After all iterations, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is `n-1`, `t` and `v` are the last input integers read in the loop. The list `num` contains all the integers `v` that were input with `t` == 3 during the loop's execution. The variable `start` is the highest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 1, or it remains -1 if no such `v` was greater than -1. The variable `end` is the lowest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 2, or it remains 1000000000.0 if no such `v` was less than 1000000000.0.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:

    #State: `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is the last element in `num`, `t` and `v` are the last input integers read in the loop, `num` must contain at least one element, `start` is the highest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 1, or it remains -1 if no such `v` was greater than -1, `end` is the lowest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 2, or it remains 1000000000.0 if no such `v` was less than 1000000000.0, and `count_num` is the total number of elements in `num` that are within the range defined by `start` and `end` (inclusive).
    if (start > end) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0.

    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
    #The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus `count_num` if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `start` is the highest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 1, or -1 if no such `v` was greater than -1. `end` is the lowest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 2, or 1000000000.0 if no such `v` was less than 1000000000.0. `count_num` is the total number of elements in `num` that are within the range defined by `start` and `end` (inclusive).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It returns 0 if the conditions for calculating the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus `count_num` are not met. Otherwise, it returns the calculated difference if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`. Here, `start` is the highest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 1, or -1 if no such `v` was greater than -1. `end` is the lowest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 2, or 1000000000.0 if no such `v` was less than 1000000000.0. `count_num` is the total number of elements in `num` that are within the range defined by `start` and `end` (inclusive).

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus `count_num` if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `start` is the highest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 1, or -1 if no such `v` was greater than -1. `end` is the lowest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 2, or 1000000000.0 if no such `v` was less than 1000000000.0. `count_num` is the total number of elements in `num` that are within the range defined by `start` and `end` (inclusive).


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
