The code appends the tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 1 and `ops` initially contains the tuple `(c, 0)`, the new tuple `(c, 1)` is added to `ops`. The value of `ci` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `ci` must be at least 0, `ops` contains the tuples `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)`.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `ci` must be at least 0, `ops` contains the tuples `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)`**
