Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `line` is a list of substrings read from standard input with at least `len(line)` elements, `ind` is `len(line) - 1`, `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` contains key-value pairs for all non-'..' substrings in the new `line`, each mapped to `(1, index)`. `allPlayers` contains key-value pairs for all player substrings in the new `line`, each with the value `False`. `goal` contains lists of tuples for all substrings ending in 'G' in the new `line`. For each substring ending in 'G', if the first character is 'B', the tuple is added to `goal[0]`; otherwise, it is added to `goal[1]`.**
