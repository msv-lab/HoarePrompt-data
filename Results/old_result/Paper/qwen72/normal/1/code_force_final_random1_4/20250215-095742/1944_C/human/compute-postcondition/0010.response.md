Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is the length of the list `arr`.
- `nums` is a Counter object containing the counts of each integer in `arr`, with the count of `arr[0]` decreased by 1.
- `start` is 0.
- `vis` is a set containing the element 0.
- The count of `start + 1` in `nums` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(start + 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `start`**: The initial state specifies that `start` is 0.
2. **Expression `start + 1`**: Since `start` is 0, `start + 1` evaluates to 1.
3. **Print Statement**: The code snippet `print(start + 1)` will print the value of `start + 1`.

### Conclusion:
The value of `start + 1` is 1, so the print statement will output 1.

Output: **1**
