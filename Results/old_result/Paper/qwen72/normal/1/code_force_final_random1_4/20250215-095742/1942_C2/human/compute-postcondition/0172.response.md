Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + gap + 2 * y`, `n`, `a`, `st`, `y` remain unchanged, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in `odd`, `even` is now sorted in ascending order, `y` is `y - (gap // 2)`**

Explanation:
- The code `ans += 2 * y` adds `2 * y` to the current value of `ans`.
- The new value of `ans` is `ans + gap + 2 * y`, where `ans` was initially `ans + gap`.
- All other variables (`x`, `i`, `t1`, `t2`, `n`, `a`, `st`, `next_elem`, `gap`, `even`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
