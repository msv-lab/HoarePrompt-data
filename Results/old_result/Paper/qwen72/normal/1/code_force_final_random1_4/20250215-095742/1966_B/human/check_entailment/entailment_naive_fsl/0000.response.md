Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining if it's impossible to make all squares the same color is flawed. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the following grid:
```
2 2
WB
BW
```
According to the problem description, this grid cannot be made into a single color because any operation would only affect the subrectangle between two squares of the same color, and there are no such pairs in this grid. However, the program will incorrectly output "YES" for this case.

The issue lies in the logic where the program checks if it's impossible to make all squares the same color. It only checks the first and last rows and columns, but it doesn't consider the entire grid. This leads to incorrect results for grids like the one mentioned above.
