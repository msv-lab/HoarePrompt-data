Postcondition: ***`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `m` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `k` is a new input integer ≥ 3, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, `b` is a new list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `a` but is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
