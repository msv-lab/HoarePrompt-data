Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` and `m` are updated to new input integers.
- The conditions based on the relationship between `n` and `m` (equality, inequality, greater than, less than or equal to, etc.) are re-evaluated with these new values.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This code snippet simply prints the string `'Yes'`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Yes**
