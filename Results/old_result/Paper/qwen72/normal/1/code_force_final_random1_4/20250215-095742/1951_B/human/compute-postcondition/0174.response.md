Postcondition: ***`s` must contain at least one element, and `i` is the last element of `s` (i.e., `s[n-1]`). If `i` is equal to `h`, and the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged, and `z` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, and `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is equal to 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.***
