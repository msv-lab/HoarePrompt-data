To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - `i`: The index variable.
   - `len(a)`: The length of the list `a`.
   - `a[i]`: The element at index `i` in list `a`.
   - `b[i]`: The element at index `i` in list `b`.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `b` is a list of integers.
   - `len(a)` is the length of list `a`.

3. **Condition Breakdown:**
   - `i < len(a)`: This condition checks if the index `i` is within the bounds of the list `a`.
   - `a[i] == b[i]`: This condition checks if the elements at index `i` in lists `a` and `b` are equal.

4. **Ensuring the First Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions must be true when `i` is 0.
   - `i < len(a)`: Since `i` is 0, this condition will always be true as long as `len(a)` is greater than 0.
   - `a[i] == b[i]`: This condition must be true for the loop to start. Therefore, `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`.

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Ensure `len(a) > 0` (which is already implied since `a` is a list of integers).
   - Ensure `a[0] == b[0]`.

### Final State:
Since `i` is 0 and `len(a)` is greater than 0 (as `a` is a list of integers), the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `a[0]` is equal to `b[0]`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the initial input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `i` is 0, `new` is a list of `None` with the same length as `a`, `new2` is a list of `None` with the same length as `a`, and `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`**.
