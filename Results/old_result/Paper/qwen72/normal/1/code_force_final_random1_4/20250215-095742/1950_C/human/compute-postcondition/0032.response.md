The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `s`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, where `hh` is an integer from 00 to 23 and `mm` is an integer from 00 to 59. The function returns a new time string in the same format "hh:mm" after adding `t` minutes to the time represented by `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 1440) and `s` (a string in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time). It returns a new time string in the format "hh:mm" after adding `t` minutes to the time represented by `s`.**
