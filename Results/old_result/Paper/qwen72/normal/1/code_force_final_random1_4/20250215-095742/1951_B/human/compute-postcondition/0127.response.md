Postcondition: ***`s` must contain at least two elements, and `i` is the third element in `s`. The conditions regarding `h`, `z`, and `ans1` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration. If `i` == `h`, `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1, and `z` is now 1. If `i` > `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` â‰¤ `h` and `z` == 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.***
