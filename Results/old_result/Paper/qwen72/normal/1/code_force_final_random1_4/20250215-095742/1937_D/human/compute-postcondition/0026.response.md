Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged from the previous iteration. If `s[2] == '>'`, `idx_A` is updated to include the value 2, and if `len(idx_A) == 0`, `A` is now a list with an additional element 0 appended. Otherwise, `A` is updated to include the new value `x` which is `A_last + (2 - idx_A_last) * len(idx_A)`, and `x` is now equal to `A_last + (2 - idx_A_last) * len(idx_A)`.***
