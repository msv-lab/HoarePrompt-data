The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 1, `t` is either 1 or 2, and `v` is an input integer. If `t` is 3, `num` is a list that now includes `v`, and `start` and `end` remain unchanged. If `t` is 1 and `start` < `v`, `start` is updated to `v`; otherwise, `start` remains unchanged. If `t` is 2 and `end` > `v`, `end` is updated to `v`; otherwise, `end` remains unchanged.**
