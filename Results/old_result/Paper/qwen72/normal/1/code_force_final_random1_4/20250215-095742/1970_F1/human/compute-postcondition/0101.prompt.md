Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `line` is the list of substrings read from standard input, `ind` is `len(line) - 1`, `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` contains key-value pairs for non-'..' substrings in the new `line`, `allPlayers` contains key-value pairs for player substrings in the new `line`, `goal` contains lists of tuples for substrings ending in 'G' in the new `line`, and `tmp` is determined based on the first character of substrings ending in 'G' in the new `line`.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `line` is the list of substrings read from standard input and must have at least 1 element, `ind` is 0, `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` contains key-value pairs for non-'..' substrings in the new `line`. If `line[0]` is not '..', `elements` includes the first element of `line` mapped to `(1, 0)`. `allPlayers` contains key-value pairs for player substrings in the new `line`. If `line[0]` is a player substring, the value for this player substring in `allPlayers` is set to `False`. If `line[0]` is not a player substring and the second character of `line[0]` is 'G', `tmp` is set to 1 and `goal[1]` now includes the tuple `(1, 0)`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged. `goal` contains lists of tuples for substrings ending in 'G' in the new `line`. If `line[0]` is '..', none of these additional changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `line` is a list of substrings read from standard input with at least 2 elements, `ind` is 1, `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` contains key-value pairs for non-'..' substrings in the new `line`. If `line[0]` is not '..', `elements` includes the first element of `line` mapped to `(1, 0)`. If `line[ind]` (i.e., `line[1]`) is not '..', `elements` now includes the second element of `line` mapped to `(1, 1)`. `allPlayers` contains key-value pairs for player substrings in the new `line`. If `line[0]` is a player substring, the value for this player substring in `allPlayers` is set to `False`. If `line[0]` is not a player substring and the second character of `line[0]` is 'G', `tmp` is set to 1 and `goal[1]` now includes the tuple `(1, 0)`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged. `goal` contains lists of tuples for substrings ending in 'G' in the new `line`. If `line[0]` is not a player substring and `line[1][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(1, 1)`. If `line[1]` is '..', none of these additional changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `line` is a list of substrings read from standard input with at least 3 elements, `ind` is 2, `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` contains key-value pairs for non-'..' substrings in the new `line`. If `line[0]` is not '..', `elements` includes the first element of `line` mapped to `(1, 0)`. If `line[1]` is not '..', `elements` now includes the second element of `line` mapped to `(1, 1)`. If `line[2]` is not '..', `elements` now includes the third element of `line` mapped to `(1, 2)`. `allPlayers` contains key-value pairs for player substrings in the new `line`. If `line[0]` is a player substring, the value for this player substring in `allPlayers` is set to `False`. If `line[0]` is not a player substring and the second character of `line[0]` is 'G', `tmp` is set to 1 and `goal[1]` now includes the tuple `(1, 0)`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged. If `line[1][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(1, 1)`. If `line[1]` is '..', none of these additional changes occur. If `line[2]` is not '..', `allPlayers` now includes the key `line[2]` with the value `False` if `line[2]` is a player substring. If `line[2]` is not a player substring and `line[2][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if `line[2][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(1, 2)`. If `line[2][1]` is not 'G', no additional changes occur.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
