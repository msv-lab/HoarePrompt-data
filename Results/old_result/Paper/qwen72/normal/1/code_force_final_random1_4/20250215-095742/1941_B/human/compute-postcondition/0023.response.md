Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `numTest` is equal to `t`, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, `opNum` is equal to `a[1]`, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - a[0]`, `a[1]` is now `a[1] - 2 * a[0] - opNum`, `a[2]` is now `a[2] - a[0]`, `a[3]` is now `a[3] - 2 * opNum`, `a[3]` is now `a[3] - opNum`, `stop` is False unless `a[1]` is less than 0, in which case `stop` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[i + 2] -= opNum` updates the value of `a[3]` by subtracting `opNum` from it.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
