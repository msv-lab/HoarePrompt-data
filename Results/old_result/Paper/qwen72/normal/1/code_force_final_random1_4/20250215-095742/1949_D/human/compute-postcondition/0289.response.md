Postcondition: ***`j` is 3. If `xx[i][2]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is updated to `nx` + `xx[i][2]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, `nx` is updated to include one additional 'S'. If neither of these conditions is met, `nx` is incremented by the character 'F'. The variables `n`, `i`, `xx`, and `sb` remain unchanged, and the condition for the loop to execute again is that `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.***
