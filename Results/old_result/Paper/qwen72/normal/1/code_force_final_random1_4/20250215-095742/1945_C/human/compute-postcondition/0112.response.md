Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 3`, `zero` is `zero`, `one` is `one`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 3)`, and `lst` remains unchanged unless `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, in which case `lst` now includes the value `3` at the end.***
