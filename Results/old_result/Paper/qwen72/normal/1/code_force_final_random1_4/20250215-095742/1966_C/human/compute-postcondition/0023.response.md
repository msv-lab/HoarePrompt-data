Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is an input integer and must be greater than 0 but now `tc` is `tc - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a 0, `i` is 2, `dp` is `True` if `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1` or `dp` was `False`, otherwise `dp` is `False`.**
