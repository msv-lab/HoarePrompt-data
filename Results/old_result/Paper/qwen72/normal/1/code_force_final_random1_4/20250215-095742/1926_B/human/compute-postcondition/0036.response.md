The code snippet `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of '1's in the string `b` to the list `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10
- The grid is represented by n lines of n characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'
- The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1
- `a` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `b` is the new input string
- If `b` contains at least one '1', `k` is a list containing the number of '1's in `b`. Otherwise, `k` is an empty list.

After executing the code:
- The list `k` now contains the count of '1's in the string `b`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, the grid is represented by n lines of n characters, where each character is either '0' or '1', the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1, `a` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` is the new input string, `k` is a list containing the number of '1's in `b`.**
