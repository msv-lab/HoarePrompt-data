You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. The variable `i` will be equal to `t - 1`. For each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` were read from the input, and based on the conditions in the loop, the program printed 'yes' or 'no' accordingly. After the loop completes, the final values of `a` and `b` will be the ones from the last iteration, but these values are not retained for further use outside the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the given program and compare it with the requirements of the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - The program checks several conditions to determine if Bob can form another rectangle:
     - **Condition 1:** `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`
       - This condition checks if both `a` and `b` are even. If both are even, Bob can always form another rectangle by cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
     - **Condition 2:** `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`
       - This condition is incorrect. It checks if `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)`, which is not a valid logical check. It should be simplified to check if `a` or `b` is 1.
     - **Condition 3:** `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`
       - This condition is also incorrect. It checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, but it does not correctly handle all cases where Bob can form another rectangle.
     - **Else:** `else`
       - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'no'.

3. **Correct Logic:**
   - Bob can form another rectangle if at least one of the dimensions (`a` or `b`) is greater than 1 and the product of the dimensions is not a prime number.
   - Specifically, if either `a` or `b` is 1, Bob cannot form another rectangle.
   - If both `a` and `b` are greater than 1, Bob can always form another rectangle by cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1 or b == 1:
            print('no')
        else:
            print('yes')
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the conditions for forming another rectangle. The corrected program checks if either dimension is 1 and prints 'no' in that case, otherwise it prints 'yes'.

Correctness: **False**
