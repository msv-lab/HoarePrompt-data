The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` integers where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, and each element `a_i` is unique and within the range `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`. The function returns different values based on specific conditions:

- **Case_1:** If the length of the list `a` is between 2 and 100,000, the function returns `n - 1`.
- **Case_2:** The function returns 13.
- **Case_3:** The function returns the value of the first element in the list `ind` minus 1, where `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, and the first element of `ind` is greater than `k`.
- **Case_4:** The function returns the maximum value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`. Here, `k` is 14, `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `x` is `a[14]`.
- **Case_5:** The function returns the minimum value between the second element of `ind` minus 1 and `k` minus 1. Here, `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, and `k` is the index of the element `x` in `a`. The first element of `ind` is 0, and `ind` has a length greater than 1.
- **Case_6:** The function returns the maximum value between `(ind[0] - 1)` and `(ind[1] - ind[0])`, where `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, and `ind[0]` is the index of the first such element, and `ind[1]` is the index of the second such element.
- **Case_7:** The function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`, where `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `k` is the index from which `x` was taken (specifically 14 if `k` is 14).

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of unique integers and returns a value based on specific conditions involving the length of the list, the indices of certain elements, and comparisons with a fixed index `k` (14). The possible return values include `n - 1`, 13, and various calculations based on the indices of elements in `a` that are greater than a specified value `x`.**
