Postcondition: ***`_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `res` is the new input string. If `res` is `<`, then `k` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<` if any input was `<`, otherwise `k` remains 1, and `best` is set to 1. If `res` is not `<`, `k` remains 1 and `best` remains 0.***
