You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.

            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `m` remain positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\). The value of `x` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \(x \times x > n\). The value of `y` is 1. The value of `cnt` is the sum of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs of `x` and `y` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and the conditions \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\) are satisfied.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt is the sum of min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y)) for all pairs of x and y where math.gcd(x, y) == 1 and (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m)

    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder (no specific value needed), and `func_1()` has been called `t` times, with 0 remaining iterations.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - For \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) to be a multiple of \(a + b\), we need to consider the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - If \(\gcd(a, b) = d\), then \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition becomes \(dy \cdot d\) is a multiple of \(dx + dy\), which simplifies to \(d^2 y\) is a multiple of \(d(x + y)\), or \(dy\) is a multiple of \(x + y\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
   - It checks if \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
   - If these conditions are met, it counts the number of valid pairs by adding the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where \(n\) and \(m\) are small (e.g., \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\)).
   - The function also handles larger values of \(n\) and \(m\) efficiently by iterating up to \(\sqrt{n}\).

5. **Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, ensuring that the solution works for multiple inputs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It efficiently counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case and handles multiple test cases as required.
