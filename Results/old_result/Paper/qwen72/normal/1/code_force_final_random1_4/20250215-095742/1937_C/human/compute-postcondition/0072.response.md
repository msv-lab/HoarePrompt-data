Let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

- `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the output.
- `n` is greater than 3, but its exact value is not needed for this print statement.
- `i` is 3.
- `res` is the new input string.
- `k` remains 1.
- `best` is 2 if `res` is '<'. Otherwise, `best` remains 0.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

We need to determine the values of `k`, `best`, and `i`:

- `k` is 1.
- `i` is 3.
- `best` depends on the value of `res`:
  - If `res` is '<', then `best` is 2.
  - Otherwise, `best` is 0.

Since the value of `res` is not explicitly provided, we need to consider both cases:

1. If `res` is '<':
   - `best` is 2.
   - The print statement will output: `? 1 2 1 3`.

2. If `res` is anything other than '<':
   - `best` is 0.
   - The print statement will output: `? 1 0 1 3`.

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we can only describe the output based on the two possible scenarios.

Output: **? 1 [best] 1 3 (where [best] is 2 if res is '<', otherwise [best] is 0)**
