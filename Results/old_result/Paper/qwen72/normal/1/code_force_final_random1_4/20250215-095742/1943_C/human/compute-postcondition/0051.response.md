The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `ci`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `ci + 1`. If `i` is less than `ci + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `ci` must be at least 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `ci` must still be at least 1 (since `ci` must be at least 0 and the loop iterates up to `ci + 1`).

State: **`i` is 2, `ci` must be at least 1, `ops` contains the tuples `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)`**
