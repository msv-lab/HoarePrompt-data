The code snippet `tot += a` updates the value of `tot` by adding the value of `a` to it. Given the initial state, `a` is the third element in the list `L`, which contains at least three values of `(n + 1) // 2` computed during the loop. The value of `a` is thus one of these computed values.

Since the condition `if tot < k and k <= tot + a` is not checked in the provided code snippet, `tot` is unconditionally incremented by `a`.

Therefore, the new value of `tot` is `tot + a`.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is `t - 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is 0, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the last computed value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0 or non-positive, `L` is a list containing at least three values of `(n + 1) // 2` computed during the loop, `pow` is 4, `a` is the third element in `L`, `tot` is `tot + a`.**
