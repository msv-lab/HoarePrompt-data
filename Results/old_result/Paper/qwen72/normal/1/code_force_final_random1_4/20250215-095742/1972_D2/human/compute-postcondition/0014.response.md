To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition involves the variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(n \geq 3\) and \(m \geq 6\).
   - `x` is 1.
   - `y` is 3.
   - `cnt` is set based on the GCD of `x` and `y`.

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
   - Substituting the current values:
     - `(1 + 3) * 1 <= n` simplifies to `4 <= n`.
     - `(1 + 3) * 3 <= m` simplifies to `12 <= m`.

4. **Determine if the Loop Can Execute Again:**
   - For the loop to execute again, both conditions must be true:
     - `4 <= n` must be true.
     - `12 <= m` must be true.

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `n` and `m` are already given as \(n \geq 3\) and \(m \geq 6\), and the current values of `x` and `y` are 1 and 3 respectively, the conditions `4 <= n` and `12 <= m` are already satisfied.
   - Therefore, no adjustments to `n` or `m` are necessary.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The loop can execute again with the current state of `x` and `y` without any adjustments to `n` or `m`.

### Final State:
Since the loop can execute again with the current state, we simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(n \geq 3\) and \(m \geq 6\). `x` is 1, `y` is 3. If the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is set to `min(n / 2, m // 2) + min(n / 3, m // 4)`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains `min(n / 2, m // 2)`**.
