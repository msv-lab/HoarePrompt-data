The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the upper limit of the range, which is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is updated to the values provided by the user input (with 1 <= n <= x), `q` is 0, `i` is 2, and `i` must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`**.
