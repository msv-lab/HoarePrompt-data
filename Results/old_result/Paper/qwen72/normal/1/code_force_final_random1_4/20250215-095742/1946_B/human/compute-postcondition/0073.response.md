Postcondition: ***`smin` is a list containing two elements. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, `smin` is updated to [0, `suf[1]`]. Otherwise, `smin` remains [0, 0]. All other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `suf`, `i`, and `sm`) retain their initial values and conditions as described in the precondition.***
