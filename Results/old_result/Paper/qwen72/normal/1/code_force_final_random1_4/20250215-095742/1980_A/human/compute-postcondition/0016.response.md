Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `missing`, `n` is the first element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `freq` is a list of 7 integers representing the frequency of characters 'A' to 'G' in `a`, `missing` is the sum of max(0, m - f) for each f in freq, `_` is incremented by 1.** 

Explanation:
- The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `freq`, and `missing` remain unchanged.
- The variables `n`, `m`, and `a` are updated to the values of the first, second, and third elements, respectively, of the tuple at the current index `_` in `test_cases`.
- The variable `_` is incremented by 1.
