The code snippet `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is a placeholder
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1
- `s` is an input string
- `sl` is a list of characters from `s`
- If `n` is even, `pk` is set to `n / 2`
- If `n` is odd, `pk` is also set to `n / 2`
- `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `sl`
- `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in `sl`
- `mini` is 100,000,000
- `i` is 1
- If the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `zero` is 2, `one` is 0, and `zero_perc` is 100. Otherwise, `zero` is 0, `one` is 2, and `zero_perc` is 0.
- In both cases, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 2)`.
- `zero_perc` is now `zero * 100 // 2`.
- If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is a list containing `[1]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.

After executing the code snippet:
- `lst` will have the value `i + 1` appended to it.

Since `i` is 1, `i + 1` is 2. Therefore, `lst` will now contain `[1, 2]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, if `n` is even, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, if `n` is odd, `pk` is also set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 1, if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `zero` is 2, `one` is 0, and `zero_perc` is 100. Otherwise, `zero` is 0, `one` is 2, and `zero_perc` is 0. In both cases, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 2)`. `zero_perc` is now `zero * 100 // 2`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is a list containing `[1, 2]`. Otherwise, `lst` is a list containing `[2]`.**
