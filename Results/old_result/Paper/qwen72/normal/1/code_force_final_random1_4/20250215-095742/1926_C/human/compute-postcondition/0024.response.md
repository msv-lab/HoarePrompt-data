The code snippet `pd[i] += int(j)` updates the value of `pd[i]` by adding the integer value of `j` to it. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `t` remains an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5.
- `N` must still be greater than `n + 1`.
- `pd` is a list of 200001 integers, where `pd[1]` is the sum of the digits of the integer `1`, and `pd[i]` for each `i` from 2 to `n` is updated to `pd[i] + sum of digits of i`.
- `i` is `n + 1`, and `pd[n + 1]` is now `pd[n + 1] + pd[n]`.

The code snippet `pd[i] += int(j)` modifies `pd[i]` (which is `pd[n + 1]`) by adding the integer value of `j` to it. Since `i` is `n + 1`, the specific update is:

- `pd[n + 1]` is updated to `pd[n + 1] + int(j)`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5, `N` is greater than `n + 1`, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is the sum of the digits of the integer `1`, and `pd[i]` for each `i` from 2 to `n` is updated to `pd[i] + sum of digits of i`, `i` is `n + 1`, `pd[n + 1]` is now `pd[n + 1] + pd[n] + int(j)`.**
