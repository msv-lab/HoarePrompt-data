Output State: **`q` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` has been incremented by `2 * q_initial + 3`, `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, followed by an additional empty string, `n` must be at least 0, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `a[1]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])` and `a[2]` which is now `int(data[idx])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `pf[1]` is now `a[1]`, `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs `{(0): [0], a[1]: [1]}`, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[i] = int(data[idx])` assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to `a[2]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
