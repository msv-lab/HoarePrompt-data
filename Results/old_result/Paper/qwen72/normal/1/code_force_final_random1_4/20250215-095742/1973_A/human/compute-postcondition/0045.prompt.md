Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. Each element in cas_de_test is a tuple of three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, representing the scores of the three players sorted in non-decreasing order. `resultats` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for p1, p2, p3 in cas_de_test:
    total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
    if total_points % 2 != 0:
        resultats.append(-1)
        continue
    total_matchs = total_points // 2
    if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
        resultats.append(-1)
        continue
    egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
    if egalites < 0:
        resultats.append(-1)
    else:
        resultats.append(egalites // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `cas_de_test` must have at least one tuple, `p1` is the first element of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second element of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third element of the first tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If `egalites` is less than 0 or if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing the value `-1`. Otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing the value `egalites // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples. `p1` is the first element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` is a list containing the value `-1` appended to its existing values. Otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing the value `egalites // 2` appended to its existing values. Additionally, if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` also contains the value `-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least three tuples. `p1` is the first element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, and `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` is a list containing one element, which is -1, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `egalites` is less than 0, `resultats` is a list containing one more element, which is -1. Otherwise, if `total_points` is even and `total_matchs` is 3 or less and `p3` is not greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is updated to include the value `egalites // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
