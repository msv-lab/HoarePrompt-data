Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `new` is a list where each element up to the point where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]` or `i-1` reaches the end of the list is `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])` and the rest are `None` values, `new2` is a list where each element up to the point where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]` or `i-1` reaches the end of the list is `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])` and the rest are `None` values, `i` is the index where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]` or the length of `a` if all elements are equal, and `a[j] == b[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i-2`. The value of `new[i-1]` is `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, and the value of `new2[i-1]` is `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `new` is a list where each element up to the point where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]` or `i-1` reaches the end of the list is `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])` and the rest are `None` values, `new2` is a list where each element up to the point where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]` or `i-1` reaches the end of the list is `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])` and the rest are `None` values, `i` is the index where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]` and `i` is now `i + 1`, `a[j] == b[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i-2`, the value of `new[i-1]` is `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, the value of `new2[i-1]` is `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, the value of `new[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])`, and the value of `new2[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `new` is a list where each element up to the point where `a[i-2] != b[i-2]` or `i-2` reaches the end of the list is `max(a[i-2], b[i-2])` and the rest are `None` values, `new2` is a list where each element up to the point where `a[i-2] != b[i-2]` or `i-2` reaches the end of the list is `min(a[i-2], b[i-2])` and the rest are `None` values, `i` is the index where `a[i-2] != b[i-2]` and `i` is now `i + 1`, `a[j] == b[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i-3`, the value of `new[i-2]` is `max(a[i-2], b[i-2])`, the value of `new2[i-2]` is `min(a[i-2], b[i-2])`, the value of `new[i-1]` is `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, and the value of `new2[i-1]` is `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `new` is a list where each element up to the point where `a[i-2] != b[i-2]` or `i-2` reaches the end of the list is `max(a[i-2], b[i-2])` and the rest are `None` values, `new2` is a list where each element up to the point where `a[i-2] != b[i-2]` or `i-2` reaches the end of the list is `min(a[i-2], b[i-2])` and the rest are `None` values, `i` is the index where `a[i-2] != b[i-2]` and `i` is now `i + 2`, `a[j] == b[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i-3`, the value of `new[i-2]` is `max(a[i-2], b[i-2])`, the value of `new2[i-2]` is `min(a[i-2], b[i-2])`, the value of `new[i-1]` is `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, the value of `new2[i-1]` is `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, the value of `new[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])`, the value of `new2[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`, and `i` must be less than `len(a)`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
