Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list containing a single element 0, `c` is a list containing a single element 0.** 

The code initializes a new list `c` with a single element 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, and `p`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
