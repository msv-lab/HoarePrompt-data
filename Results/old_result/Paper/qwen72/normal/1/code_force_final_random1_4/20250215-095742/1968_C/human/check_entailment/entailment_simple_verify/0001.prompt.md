You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 1000
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x_2, ..., x_n are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = [0] * n
        
        a[0] = 1000
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        
        print(*a)
        
    #State: _ is t-1, `n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `a[0]` set to 1000, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the value of `n` (the length of the array `a`) and the list `x` containing the remainders.

2. **Array Initialization**: An array `a` of length `n` is initialized with zeros. This is a common practice to pre-allocate memory for the array.

3. **Setting the First Element**: The first element of `a` is set to 1000. This choice is arbitrary but must be large enough to ensure that the subsequent elements can satisfy the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \).

4. **Constructing the Array `a`**:
   - For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, the value of `a[i]` is set to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.
   - This ensures that \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i \) because:
     - \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \)
     - Therefore, \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = (a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}) \bmod a_{i-1} = x_{i-1} \)

5. **Output**: The constructed array `a` is printed for each test case.

### Verification:
- **Constraints**: The values of `a_i` are within the range \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \), which is satisfied since `a[0]` is 1000 and each subsequent element is at most 1000 plus the maximum value of `x_i` (which is 500).
- **Correctness of the Remainder Condition**: The construction \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \) ensures that the remainder condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) holds true for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly constructs the array `a` for each test case and satisfies the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
