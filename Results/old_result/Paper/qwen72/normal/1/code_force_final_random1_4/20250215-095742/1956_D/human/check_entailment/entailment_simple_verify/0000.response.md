### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate or not.

#### Function 1: `func_1(a, l, r, ops)`
- **Base Case**: When `l == r`, if `a[l] != 0`, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and appends `(l, l)` to `ops`.
- **Recursive Case**: It recursively calls itself with `l + 1` and `r`. After the recursive call, if `a[l] != r - l + 1`, it sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and appends `(l, r)` to `ops`.

#### Function 2: `func_2(a)`
- Initializes `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`.
- Returns the sum of `a`, the length of `ops`, and `ops`.

#### Function 3: `recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`
- Calculates the sum `s` of the subarray `a[l:r + 1]`.
- If `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it calls `func_1(a, l, r, ops)`, sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1`, and appends `(l, r)` to `ops`.
- Otherwise, it finds the maximum value `mx` in the subarray and its position `pos`. It recursively calls itself for the left and right subarrays around `pos`.

#### Function 4: `func_3()`
- Reads input `n` and `a`.
- Calls `func_2(a)` to get the sum, number of operations, and the operations themselves.
- Prints the results.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Condition in `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - The condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):` is not correctly identifying when to apply the MEX operation. This condition can lead to incorrect operations being applied, especially in cases where the sum of the subarray is already large but not maximized.
   - For example, consider the input:
     ```
     4
     1 2 3 4
     ```
     The expected output should be:
     ```
     10 0
     ```
     However, the current implementation might incorrectly apply operations and change the array, leading to a suboptimal sum.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX calculation is not explicitly handled in the code. The function `func_1` assumes that setting all elements to `r - l + 1` is the correct MEX value, which is not always true.
   - The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, and this is not being calculated correctly.

3. **Recursive Calls**:
   - The recursive calls in `recursive_maximize_sum` do not handle the base case properly. It should ensure that the MEX value is correctly calculated and applied.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program has logical issues in the `recursive_maximize_sum` function and the MEX calculation is not handled correctly. These issues can lead to incorrect operations being applied, resulting in a suboptimal sum.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
