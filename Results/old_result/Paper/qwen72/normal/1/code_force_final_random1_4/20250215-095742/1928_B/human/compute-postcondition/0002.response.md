To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the conditions within the loop head. The loop head specifies:

```python
for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
```

This means:
- `i` starts at `len(arr) - 1` (the last index of the list `arr`).
- The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.

For the loop to execute at least once:
- `arr` must have at least one element (i.e., `len(arr)` must be greater than 0).

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of positive integers.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `tem` is 1.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `arr` must have at least one element, and `i` should be set to `len(arr) - 1`.

State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least one element, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**
