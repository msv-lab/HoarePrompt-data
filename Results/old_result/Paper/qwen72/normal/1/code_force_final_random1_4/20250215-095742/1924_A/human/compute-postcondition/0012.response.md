Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 1 character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the first character of `s`, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus 97. The variable `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, indicating that all bits up to the `k`-th bit (inclusive) in `cur` are set.**
