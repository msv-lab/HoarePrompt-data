The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints given, it appears to handle multiple test cases where each test case involves two integers `x` and `y`. The constraints indicate that `t` represents the number of test cases, with each `x` and `y` being integers within the range of 0 to 99. However, without further details on what the function returns for each test case, I cannot fully describe the output. Assuming the function processes these inputs and returns some result for each test case, the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). The function returns a result for each test case, though the specific nature of the result is not specified in the provided information.**
