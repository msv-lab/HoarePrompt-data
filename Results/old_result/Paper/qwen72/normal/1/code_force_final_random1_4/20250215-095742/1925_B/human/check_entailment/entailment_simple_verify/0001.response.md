### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires dividing a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

2. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` can be used to form `n` sub-problems whose sum is `x` and whose GCD is maximized.
   - Specifically, it checks if `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`. If both conditions are true, `i` is a valid candidate for the GCD.
   - It also checks the same conditions for `x // i` to ensure all divisors are considered.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - It correctly checks if the divisor `i` can be used to form `n` sub-problems whose sum is `x`.
   - It correctly updates the maximum GCD found so far.
   - The program handles multiple test cases as required.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 (trivial case where the GCD is `x` itself).
   - The program handles the case where `x` is 1 (trivial case where the GCD is 1).

5. **Optimization:**
   - The program uses the square root of `x` to limit the number of iterations, which is an efficient approach for finding divisors.

### Validation Using Annotated Code:
- The annotated code confirms that the program initializes `ans` to 1 and iterates over all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
- It correctly checks the conditions for both `i` and `x // i` to ensure all divisors are considered.
- The final state of `ans` after the loop is the maximum GCD that can be achieved for the given `x` and `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem. It efficiently finds the maximum GCD for the given constraints.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
