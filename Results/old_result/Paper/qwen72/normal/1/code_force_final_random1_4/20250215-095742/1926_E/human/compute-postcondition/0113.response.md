Output State: **`n` and `k` retain their initial values (positive integers between 1 and 50,000), `_` remains a placeholder, `s` equals `k` or the sum of the series of `(d + 1) // 2` until `s >= k` or `d <= 0`, `i` is at least 3, `d` is the remaining value after subtracting `(d + 1) // 2` from `n` multiple times, `h` is now `h - (h + 1) // 2 - (h + 1) // 2`, `p` is 4, `g` is now `(n + 1) // 2 + (h - (h + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2 + (h + 1) // 2`, and `f` and `y` retain their initial values or conditions.**
