Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer provided by the new user input, `m` must be greater than `m - 1`, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a user input, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m`, `ans` is 'YES', the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`. `impossible` is `False`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets `impossible` to `False`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
- The condition that `impossible` is `False` is now explicitly stated in the output state.
