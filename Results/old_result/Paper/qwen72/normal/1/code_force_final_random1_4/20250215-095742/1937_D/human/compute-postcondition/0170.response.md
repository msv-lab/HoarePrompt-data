Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 2 (this doesn't directly affect the calculation but is part of the context).
- `a` is assigned the value at index `l` of the list `A`.
- `x` is `r - (l + 2)`.
- `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1)`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.

2. **Value of `a`:**
   - `a` is the value at index `l` of the list `A`.
   - Since `l` is not explicitly given, we cannot determine the exact value of `a` without knowing `l` and the contents of `A`.

3. **Value of `b`:**
   - `b` is calculated as `(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1)`.
   - `r` is not explicitly given, so we cannot determine the exact value of `b` without knowing `r`, `l`, and the contents of `idx_B`.

4. **Expression inside the print statement:**
   - The expression is `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.
   - Substituting the known value of `i`:
     - `a * 2 + b * 2 + 2 + 1`
     - Simplifying further:
     - `a * 2 + b * 2 + 3`

### Final Output:
Since `a` and `b` depend on the values of `l`, `r`, and the lists `A` and `idx_B`, we cannot determine their exact numerical values. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + 3 (where a is the value at index l of the list A, and b is (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1))**
