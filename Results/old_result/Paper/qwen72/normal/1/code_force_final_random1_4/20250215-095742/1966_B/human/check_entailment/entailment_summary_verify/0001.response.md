### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using the specified operations.
   - An operation involves selecting two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If the top-left corner and the bottom-right corner of the grid have different colors, it might be impossible to make the entire grid the same color.
   - However, if there are adjacent squares along the edges that have the same color, it might still be possible to achieve the goal.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid and the grid itself.
   - It initializes the answer `ans` to 'YES'.
   - It checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) have different colors.
     - If they do, it sets a flag `impossible` to `True` and checks the rows and columns for any adjacent squares that have the same color.
     - If no such adjacent squares are found, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves a grid of dimensions n x m with cells colored 'W' or 'B'.
   - For each test case, the function checks if the top-left cell is different from the bottom-right cell.
   - If they are different and all cells in the first and last rows are the same, and all cells in the first and last columns are the same, the function outputs 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it outputs 'YES'.
   - The function prints the result for each test case and does not return any value.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the grid is already uniform (all squares are the same color).
   - It also handles the case where the top-left and bottom-right corners are different but there are adjacent squares along the edges that can be used to perform operations.

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not explicitly check if the entire grid can be made uniform if the top-left and bottom-right corners are different but there are other configurations that allow it.
   - However, the logic seems to cover the necessary conditions to determine if it's impossible to make the grid uniform.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem based on the given constraints and examples. It checks the necessary conditions to determine if it's possible to make the entire grid the same color. The logic is sound and covers the key scenarios described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
