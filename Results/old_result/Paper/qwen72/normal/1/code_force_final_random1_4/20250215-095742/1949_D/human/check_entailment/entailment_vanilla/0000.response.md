### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` representing the number of scenarios.
   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of funny (`F`) and scary (`S`) transitions involving each scenario.
   - It reads the input matrix `xx` and updates `a` and `b` accordingly.

2. **Identifying Scenarios with Known Transitions:**
   - The program creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to store scenarios that have only funny or only scary transitions, respectively.

3. **Handling Undecided Transitions:**
   - If the number of scenarios with only funny transitions (`sa`) is greater than or equal to those with only scary transitions (`sb`), the program assigns the remaining transitions to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type occur.
   - If the number of scenarios with only scary transitions (`sb`) is greater, the program does the opposite.

4. **Output Generation:**
   - The program constructs the final transition matrix by assigning 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions based on the conditions set in the previous steps.
   - It prints the final transition matrix.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Input Parsing and Initialization:**
  - The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary data structures.
  - It correctly updates the counts of funny and scary transitions for each scenario.

- **Correctness of Handling Undecided Transitions:**
  - The logic for handling undecided transitions ensures that the number of consecutive transitions of the same type does not exceed \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\).
  - The program uses a balanced approach to distribute the transitions, ensuring that the requirement is met.

- **Output Generation:**
  - The program correctly generates the output matrix and prints it in the required format.
  - It respects the constraints of the problem, including the symmetry of the transition matrix and the limit on consecutive transitions.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It ensures that the transition videos meet the specified constraints and outputs a valid solution.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
