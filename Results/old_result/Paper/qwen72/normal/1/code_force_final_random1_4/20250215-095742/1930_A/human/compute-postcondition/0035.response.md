Output State: **_ is 2, n is a new input integer greater than 1, l is a sorted list of integers from user input, score is the sum of every second element in l starting from index 0 up to the last even index less than 2 * n, i is 2 * n - 2.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `score` will contain the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from the first element (index 0) and continuing to the last even index that is less than `2 * n`. The variable `i` will be equal to `2 * n - 2`, which is the last index that was processed in the loop. The variables `_` and `n` remain unchanged as they were not modified within the loop.
