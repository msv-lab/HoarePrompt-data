Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `numTest` is equal to `t`, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `opNum` is now `a[2]` (which is 0), `a[0]` is 0, `a[1]` is `a[1] - a[2]` (unchanged since `a[2]` is 0), `a[2]` is 0, `a[3]` is `a[3] - 3 * a[2]` (unchanged since `a[2]` is 0), `a[3]` is now `a[3] - 2 * opNum` (which is `a[3] - 0`), `stop` remains False.**
