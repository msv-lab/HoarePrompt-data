The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the variable `n`, so we can only adjust these.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the condition `i < n - 2` to hold true.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `numTest` is equal to `t`, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is 2, `opNum` is now `a[1]`, `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are 0, `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 3 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - 2 * opNum`. `stop` remains False.**
