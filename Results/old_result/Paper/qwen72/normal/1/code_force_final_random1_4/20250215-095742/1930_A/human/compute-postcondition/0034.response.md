The value of `score` is updated by adding the value of `l[i]` to its current value. The current value of `score` is `l[0] + l[2]`, and `i` is 4, so `score` becomes `l[0] + l[2] + l[4]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `score` is `l[0] + l[2] + l[4]`, `i` is 4**
