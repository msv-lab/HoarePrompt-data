You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by user input for each iteration, `t` remains the same, `i` is `t - 1`, `count` is `m + 1` for the last iteration, `ans` is the final value after all iterations, which is calculated as `n + sum(int((int(n / k) - (k - 1)) / k) + 1 for k in range(2, m + 1))` for each pair of `n` and `m`, `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop executed, `countmins` is `m - 1` for the last iteration, `g` is `int(n / m) - (m - 1)` for the last iteration. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks before reaching `count = m + 1` for the last iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), we need to consider the properties of \(\gcd(a, b)\).
   - If \(b = 1\), then \(a + 1\) must be a multiple of \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\), which is always true. Therefore, all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid.
   - For \(b > 1\), the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is more restrictive. Specifically, \(a\) must be such that \(a + b\) is divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `count` to 2 and starts a loop from 2 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\) (starting from 2), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values.
   - It uses the formula `g = int(n / count)` to find the maximum possible value of \(a\) that can satisfy the condition.
   - It then checks if `g` is less than `count - 1`. If so, it breaks the loop.
   - Otherwise, it updates the answer by adding the number of valid \(a\) values for the current \(b\).

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case when \(b = 1\) by initializing `ans` to `n`.
   - For \(b > 1\), the logic to calculate the number of valid \(a\) values seems to be based on the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - However, the specific logic inside the loop might not be entirely clear or correct. The formula `g = int(n / count)` and the subsequent calculations might not accurately capture the required condition.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The logic inside the loop might not correctly count the number of valid pairs for \(b > 1\).
   - The condition `if g < countmins:` might be too restrictive and could lead to missing valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity of the problem and the potential issues in the logic inside the loop, the program does not seem to correctly implement the required solution.
