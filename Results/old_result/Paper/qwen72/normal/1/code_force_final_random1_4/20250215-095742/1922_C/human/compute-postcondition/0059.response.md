Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a new list of integers read from input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default values of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by user input. If the last `y` > last `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`. If the last `y` â‰¤ last `x`, then `y` is less than or equal to `x`.**

Explanation:
- The line `d1 = defaultdict(int)` reinitializes `d1` as a defaultdict with default values of 0.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `l`, `d2`, `m`, `j`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions regarding `x` and `y` remain valid as they were not affected by the code.
