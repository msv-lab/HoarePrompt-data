Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 1, `i` is `n + 1`. If the character at position `j - 1` (which is 0) in the string `xx[i]` is not a question mark ('?'), then `nx` is set to the character at position 0 in the string `xx[n + 1]`. Otherwise, if the character at position `i` in `xx` and index `j - 1` is `?`, and if `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.***
