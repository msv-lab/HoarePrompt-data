The code snippet assigns to `i` the value of `c[b] - c[a - 1]`. This means that `i` will now hold the difference between the value at index `b` in the list `c` and the value at index `a - 1` in the same list. The values of `_`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.**
