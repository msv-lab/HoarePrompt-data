Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 1, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the program does nothing. Otherwise, `n_cases` is greater than or equal to \(2^{(n-1)}\), `n` is set to `log2(n_cases)`, and `power` is either `n` or `n - 1`. If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains `n`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `n - 1`.***
