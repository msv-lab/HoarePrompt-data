Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `a` has at least `len(a)` elements, `b`, `bd`, `ad`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `l` is 2, `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-2] / bd[len(a)-2]]`, `m` is 0, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`, `ql` is the integer value provided by the user input, `q` must be greater than 2. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the sequence.***
