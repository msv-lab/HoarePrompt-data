The code snippet `b.append(a[l])` appends the element at index `l` from list `a` to list `b`. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `a`, `b`, or `l`, we can only infer that `b` now contains one additional element, which is the element at index `l` of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `i` is 1, `b` has one more element appended from `a[l]`.**
