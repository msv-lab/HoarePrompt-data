Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The logic in the provided solution is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if 4 * n - 2 == k:` is not correctly handling the special case where `k` is equal to the total number of diagonals (`4n - 2`). Additionally, the general approach of using `ceil(k / 2)` does not always provide the correct minimum number of cells to color.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Special Case Handling**: When `k` is exactly `4n - 2`, the program prints `k // 2 + 1`. This is incorrect because the minimum number of cells needed to cover all diagonals is actually `n`.

2. **General Case**: For other values of `k`, the program uses `ceil(k / 2)`. This is not always correct. For example, when `k` is close to `4n - 2`, the number of cells needed is closer to `n` rather than `ceil(k / 2)`.

A correct approach would involve considering the following:
- If `k` is less than or equal to `2n - 1`, the minimum number of cells needed is `ceil(k / 2)`.
- If `k` is greater than `2n - 1`, the minimum number of cells needed is `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k <= 2 * n - 1:
            print((k + 1) // 2)
        else:
            print(n)

func()
```

This corrected version handles both the general and special cases correctly.
