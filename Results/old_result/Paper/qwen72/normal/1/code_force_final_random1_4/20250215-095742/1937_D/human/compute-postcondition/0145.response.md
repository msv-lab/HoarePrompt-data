The value of `b` is updated to `b - B[r - l]`. Since `b` was initially `B[r]`, the new value of `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l]`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `i` is still 1
- `n` is still greater than 1
- `r` is still decreased by 1
- `a` is still `A[l - 1] + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l]`**.
