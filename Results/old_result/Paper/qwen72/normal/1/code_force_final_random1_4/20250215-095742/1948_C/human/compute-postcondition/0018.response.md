Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string. The loop has completed all its iterations, and the final value of `i` is `n-1` if `n` is odd, or `n-2` if `n` is even. If at any point during the loop, `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the loop would have broken and printed 'No'. If the loop completes without breaking, it prints 'yes'.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over odd numbers starting from 1 up to `n-1` (if `n` is odd) or `n-2` (if `n` is even).
- For each iteration, the loop checks if the conditions `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` are met.
- If these conditions are met at any point, the loop breaks and prints 'No'.
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it prints 'yes'.
- The final value of `i` will be the last odd number less than `n`.
- The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
