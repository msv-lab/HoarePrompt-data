The provided code snippet reads a space-separated list of integers from the input and assigns them to the list `feat`.

Given the Initial State:
- `i` is `n`
- `n` is greater than or equal to the initial value of `n`
- `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4
- `feat` is a list of integers from the input
- `f` is equal to the second element of `feat`
- `a` is equal to the third element of `feat`
- `b` is equal to the last element of `feat`
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input
- `array2` is a list that contains elements based on the condition `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1`. Each element in `array2` is the result of `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a` if the condition is met.
- If the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, then the condition is true. Otherwise, the sum of `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `feat` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input.

The values of `i`, `n`, `test_cases`, `arr`, and `array2` remain unchanged, but the values of `f`, `a`, and `b` are now determined by the new values in `feat`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to the initial value of `n`, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the new input, `f` is the second element of the new `feat`, `a` is the third element of the new `feat`, `b` is the last element of the new `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, and `array2` is a list that contains elements based on the condition `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1`. Each element in `array2` is the result of `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a` if the condition is met. If the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, then the condition is true. Otherwise, the sum of `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is greater than or equal to `f`.**
