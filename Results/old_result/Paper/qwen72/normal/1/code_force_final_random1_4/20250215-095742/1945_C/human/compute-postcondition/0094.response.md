The code snippet `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `i + 1` is 1. This means that the value 1 is appended to `lst`.

The other variables (`n`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) are not modified by this code snippet, so their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', `zero` is increased by 1, otherwise, `one` is increased by 1, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 1`, `one_perc` is `(n - one) * 100 // (n - 1)`, `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` contains the value 1.**
