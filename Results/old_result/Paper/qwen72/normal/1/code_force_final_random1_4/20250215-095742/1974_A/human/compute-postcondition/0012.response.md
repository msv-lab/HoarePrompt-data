Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2`, and `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is updated to `15 * z - y * 4`.
- Since `z` is already defined as `(y + 1) // 2`, the new value of `m` is calculated using this expression.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `i`, and `z`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
