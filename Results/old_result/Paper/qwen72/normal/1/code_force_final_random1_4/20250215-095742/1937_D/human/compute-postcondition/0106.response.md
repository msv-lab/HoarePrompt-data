Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- The character at index 0 of `s` is not '>'.
- `r` is decreased by 1.
- `l` is greater than `r`.
- The current value of `r` is 0.

### Variables and Their Values:
- `i = 0`
- `n > 0` (but the exact value of `n` is not specified)
- `r = 0` (after being decreased by 1, so initially it was 1)
- `l > r` (since `r` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0)

### Expression in the Print Statement:
```python
print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate `n - i`:**
   - Since `i` is 0, this simplifies to `n - 0`, which is just `n`.

2. **Calculate `i - idx_A[l - 1]`:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `l` is greater than 0, so `l - 1` is a non-negative integer.
   - `idx_A[l - 1]` is an element from the list `idx_A` at index `l - 1`.
   - Since the exact value of `l` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `idx_A[l - 1]`.

3. **Calculate `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`:**
   - This is `0 - idx_A[l - 1]` multiplied by 2, which simplifies to `-2 * idx_A[l - 1]`.

4. **Combine the results:**
   - The expression becomes `n + (-2 * idx_A[l - 1])`, which simplifies to `n - 2 * idx_A[l - 1]`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the value of `n - 2 * idx_A[l - 1]`.

Since the exact value of `idx_A[l - 1]` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables.

Output: **n - 2 * idx_A[l - 1] (where n is the value of n and idx_A[l - 1] is the element at index l - 1 in the list idx_A)**
