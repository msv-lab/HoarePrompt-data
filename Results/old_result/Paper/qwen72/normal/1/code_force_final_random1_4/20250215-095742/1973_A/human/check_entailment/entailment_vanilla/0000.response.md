### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t` (the number of test cases) and `cas_de_test` (a list of tuples representing the scores of the three players for each test case).

2. **Total Points Check**: 
   - The function calculates the total points scored by all three players (`total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`).
   - If the total points are not even (`total_points % 2 != 0`), it means the scores cannot be achieved by any combination of games (since each game results in either 2 points or 2 points from a draw), so the function appends `-1` to the results and continues to the next test case.

3. **Total Matches Check**:
   - The function calculates the total number of matches played (`total_matchs = total_points // 2`).
   - If the total number of matches is greater than 3 or if the highest score (`p3`) is greater than the total number of matches, it means the scores are not achievable, so the function appends `-1` to the results and continues to the next test case.

4. **Calculating Draws**:
   - The function calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula is derived from the fact that the difference in points between the highest scorer and the others should be accounted for by wins and draws.
   - If the number of draws (`egalites`) is negative, it means the scores are not achievable, so the function appends `-1` to the results.
   - Otherwise, the function appends the number of draws divided by 2 (`egalites // 2`) to the results.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns a list of results, which is then printed in the main part of the code.

### Correctness:
- The logic for checking the total points and total matches is correct.
- The formula for calculating the number of draws is also correct.
- The function handles all edge cases and invalid inputs correctly.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
