The function `func_4` reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, sorts the resulting list of integers, and returns the sorted list. The function does not take any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the program has a sorted list of integers derived from the user's input.
