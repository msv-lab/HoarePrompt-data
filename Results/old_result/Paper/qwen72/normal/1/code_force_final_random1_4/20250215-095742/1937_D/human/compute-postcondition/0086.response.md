Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the first character of `s` is '>'. If `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, and `b` is `idx_B[r - 1] * (l + 1)`. If `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, and `r` is 0, the program maintains the conditions. If `l` is greater than or equal to `r` and `r` is not 0, `a` is updated to `B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r`, and `b` is updated to `b - idx_A[l - 1] * r`.***
