Output State: **The loop continues to append the predecessor of the last element in `path_ba` until it encounters `-1`. At this point, the loop terminates. The final state of `path_ba` will be a list containing the sequence of predecessors starting from `b` and ending with the first vertex that has no predecessor (indicated by `-1`). The length of `path_ba` is odd. The variable `n` will be `-1`, indicating the end of the path. The variables `_`, `u`, `v`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values. `ops` is an empty list. `ci` is equal to half the length of `path_ba` (rounded down to the nearest integer).**
