Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 1, `pos_final` is decreased by 1, `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on which is smaller, and `best` is the minimum of its original value and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is used, or remains unchanged if `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is used.***
