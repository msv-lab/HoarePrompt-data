### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_15`**:
   - The function `func_15` is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - However, the function `func_15` is implementing a completely different logic. It calculates a value based on a loop that increments `i` and checks a condition involving `n` and `i`. This logic is unrelated to the problem of finding pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function `func_16`**:
   - The function `func_16` is responsible for handling multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case.
   - Since `func_15` is incorrect, the results produced by `func_16` will also be incorrect.

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   - A correct implementation would need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges and check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
   - The provided code does not perform this check and instead uses a different, unrelated calculation.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not solve the problem as described and is therefore incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
