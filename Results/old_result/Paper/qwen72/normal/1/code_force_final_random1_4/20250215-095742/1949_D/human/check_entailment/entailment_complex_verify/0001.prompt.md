You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are designing a new video game. It has n scenarios, which the player may
play in any order, but each scenario must be played exactly once. When a
player switches from a scenario to another scenario, the game shows a
specially crafted transition video to make it all feel part of one big story.
This video is specific to a pair of scenarios, but not to their order, in
other words, the video playing when switching from scenario a to scenario b is
the same as the video playing when switching from scenario b to scenario a .
Therefore, you need to create \frac{n(n-1)}{2} different transition videos,
one for each possible pair of different scenarios.

Each transition video can be either funny or scary. It is boring to see too
many funny videos or too many scary videos in a row. Therefore, your goal is
to create the videos in such a way that no matter in which order does the
player approach the scenarios, they will never see more than \lceil
\frac{3n}{4} \rceil transition videos of the same type in a row.

You have already come up with ideas for at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor of
the transition videos, and therefore already know if those will be funny or
scary. Now you need to choose funny or scary for all other transition videos
in such a way that the above requirement is satisfied.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 24 ) — the number of
scenarios in the game.

The next n lines describe the partial transition video plan. Each of those
lines contains n characters. The j -th character of the i -th line corresponds
to the transition video between the i -th and the j -th scenarios. It will be
F if the corresponding transition video will be funny, S if the corresponding
transition video will be scary, ? if the corresponding transition video is
still undecided, or . if i=j .

It is guaranteed that the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th
character of the i -th line will be the same for all i and j . It is
guaranteed that at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor (n divided by 2, rounded
down) transition videos will already be decided, in other words, that at most
2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters in the input will be F or S.

Output

Print n lines describing the full transition video plan in the same format as
the input. Each of those lines must contain n characters. The j -th character
of the i -th line must be F if the corresponding transition video is funny, S
if the corresponding transition video is scary, or . if i=j .

Each ? character from the input must be replaced with either F or S, and all
other characters from the input must remain unchanged. It must still hold that
the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th character of the i -th
line are the same for all i and j .

For each permutation of the n scenarios, it must hold that the transition
videos corresponding to playing the scenarios in this order do not have more
than \lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil (3n divided by 4, rounded up) videos of the
same type consecutively.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. It can be proven that for
all inputs satisfying the constraints of this problem a solution always
exists.

Note

In the first sample: We are allowed \lceil \frac{3\cdot 5}{4} \rceil=4
transition videos of the same type in a row, but for any permutation of the 5
scenarios the player will see only 4 transition videos in total, therefore we
can choose funny or scary freely. We must still respect the already chosen
types.

In the second sample: One of the 479001600 possible permutations of scenarios
is 1, 7, 4, 12, 9, 8, 2, 6, 10, 3, 11, 5. The player will get the following
sequence of transition videos for this permutation: SSSSSSSSSFS. Even though
this sequence has 10 scary transition videos in total, it has only 9 scary
transition videos in a row, which is the maximum allowed amount (\lceil
\frac{3\cdot 12}{4} \rceil=9 ).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a symmetric matrix of size n x n, where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The matrix contains characters 'F', 'S', '?', and '.', representing funny, scary, undecided, and no transition states, respectively. The function reads the matrix from user input and updates the undecided states ('?') based on the distribution of 'F' and 'S' characters. It ensures that the resulting matrix maintains the symmetry and the constraints on the number of 'F' and 'S' characters. The function prints the updated matrix, where each undecided state is replaced with 'F' or 'S' according to specific rules: if there are more indices with 'F' than 'S', undecided states are more likely to become 'F', especially in the first quarter of the matrix; otherwise, they are more likely to become 'S'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` representing the number of scenarios.
   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of funny (`F`) and scary (`S`) transitions involving each scenario.
   - It reads the input matrix `xx` and updates `a` and `b` accordingly.

2. **Identifying Scenarios with Known Transitions:**
   - The program creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to store scenarios that have only funny or only scary transitions, respectively.

3. **Handling Undecided Transitions:**
   - If the number of scenarios with only funny transitions (`sa`) is greater than or equal to those with only scary transitions (`sb`), the program assigns the remaining transitions to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type occur.
   - If the number of scenarios with only scary transitions (`sb`) is greater, the program does the opposite.

4. **Output Generation:**
   - The program constructs the final transition matrix by assigning 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions based on the conditions set in the previous steps.
   - It prints the final transition matrix.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Input Parsing and Initialization:**
  - The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary data structures.
  - It correctly updates the counts of funny and scary transitions for each scenario.

- **Correctness of Handling Undecided Transitions:**
  - The logic for handling undecided transitions ensures that the number of consecutive transitions of the same type does not exceed \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\).
  - The program uses a balanced approach to distribute the transitions, ensuring that the requirement is met.

- **Output Generation:**
  - The program correctly generates the output matrix and prints it in the required format.
  - It respects the constraints of the problem, including the symmetry of the transition matrix and the limit on consecutive transitions.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It ensures that the transition videos meet the specified constraints and outputs a valid solution.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
