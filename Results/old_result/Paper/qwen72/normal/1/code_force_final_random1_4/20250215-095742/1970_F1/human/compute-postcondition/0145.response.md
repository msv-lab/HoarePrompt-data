Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `t` is greater than 0, `obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string in `command`, `el` is the third string in `command`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `True`.** 

In the output state, the dictionary `allPlayers` now contains a key-value pair where the key is the value of `obj` (which is the first string in `command`) and the value is `True`. All other variables remain unchanged.
