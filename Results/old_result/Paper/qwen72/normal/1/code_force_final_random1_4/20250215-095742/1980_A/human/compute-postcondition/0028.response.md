Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the original element and the value of `missing`, `n` is the first element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where each element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by the count of corresponding characters in `a`, `missing` is the sum of max(0, m - f) for each f in `freq`, `_` is incremented by 1.** 

Explanation:
- The variables `n`, `m`, and `a` are updated to the first, second, and third elements of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `freq`, `missing`, `_`) remain unchanged.
- The index `_` is incremented by 1, indicating the next tuple in `test_cases` will be processed in the next iteration.
