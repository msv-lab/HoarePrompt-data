Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is the length of the list `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object containing the counts of each integer in `arr`. `start` is 0. `vis` is a set containing the element 0.** 

The set `vis` now contains the element 0, which was added from the variable `start`. All other variables remain unchanged.
