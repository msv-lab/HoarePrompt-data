Output State: **`q` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is incremented by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index in `v2` where `r` would fit to maintain sorted order minus 1. If `x == 0`, `results` now includes 'YES', and the program skips the rest of the current iteration. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statements in the loop.**

Explanation:
- The value of `it1` is updated to the index in `v1` where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order using `bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)`.
- All other variables (`q`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it2`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition `if x == 0` and its effects (adding 'YES' to `results` and skipping the rest of the current iteration) are not affected by the code snippet provided.
