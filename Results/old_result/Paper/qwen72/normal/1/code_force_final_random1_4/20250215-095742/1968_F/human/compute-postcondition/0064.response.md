Output State: **`it2` is the index in `v2` where the last element less than `r` is located, or -1 if no such element exists. All other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The line `it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1` updates the value of `it2`.
- `bisect_left(v2, r)` finds the index in `v2` where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted. Subtracting 1 gives the index of the last element in `v2` that is less than `r`.
- If no such element exists, `bisect_left(v2, r)` returns 0, and `it2` becomes -1.
- All other variables (`it1`, `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `n`, `q`, `idx`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `results`) remain unchanged.
