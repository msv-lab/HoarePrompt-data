Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `i` is 0. If the first character of the string `s` is 'L', `b` now contains the element at index `l` of list `a`, and `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the first character of the string `s` is not 'L', `b` is a list that now includes the element `a[r-1]`, and `r` is decremented by 1.***
