Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with `a[1]` set to 1 and `a[2]` set to 3, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, `x` is a user input string, and `j` is 2.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `a[j]` (which is `a[2]`) is incremented by 1. Initially, `a[2]` was 2 (if the character at index 1 of `x` was 'F') or 0 (if the character at index 1 of `x` was not 'F'). After the increment, `a[2]` becomes 3.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
