Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder (no specific value needed), and `func_1()` has been called.** 

The function `func_1()` has been executed, but since no return value or changes to existing variables are specified, the initial state remains unchanged except for the fact that `func_1()` has been called.
