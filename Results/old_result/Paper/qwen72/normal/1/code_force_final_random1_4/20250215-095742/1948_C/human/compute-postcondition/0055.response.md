Output State: **The loop has completed all `t` iterations. For each iteration, `n` was an input integer, `a` and `b` were input strings. The loop counter `_` has incremented from 0 to `t-1`. For each test case, the loop has checked all odd indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` (if `n` is odd) or `n-2` (if `n` is even). If at any point during the loop, `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the loop would have broken and printed 'No'. Otherwise, it printed 'Yes' after completing all iterations.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, it checked the conditions specified in the inner loop for all relevant indices. If any condition was met, it printed 'No' and moved to the next test case. If no condition was met for any test case, it printed 'Yes' for that test case. After processing all `t` test cases, the loop has finished executing.
