Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, if `n` is even, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, if `n` is odd, `pk` is also set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's encountered in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's encountered in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - (n - 1) - 1)`, and `lst` contains the indices (1-based) where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, if `n` is even, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, if `n` is odd, `pk` is also set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in `sl`, `mini` is updated to the minimum of 100,000,000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's encountered in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's encountered in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - (n - 1) - 1)`, and `lst` must contain at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, if `n` is even, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, if `n` is odd, `pk` is also set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in `sl`, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's encountered in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's encountered in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - (n - 1) - 1)`, and `lst` must contain at least two elements, `ele` is the second element in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, if `n` is even, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, if `n` is odd, `pk` is also set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in `sl`, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's encountered in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's encountered in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - (n - 1) - 1)`, and `lst` must contain at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in `lst`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
