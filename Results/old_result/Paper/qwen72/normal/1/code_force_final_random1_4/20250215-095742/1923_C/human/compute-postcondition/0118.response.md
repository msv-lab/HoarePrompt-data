Postcondition: ***`l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element of `l`, `i` is equal to the first element of `l`, `p` now contains the value of the first element of `l` as its first element. If `x` is 1, `j` is 2 and `c` is [1] if the first element of `l` is 1; otherwise, `j` is 1 and `c` is [0]. If `x` is not 1, `j` remains 1 and `c` remains [0] if the first element of `l` is 1; otherwise, `j` remains 0 and `c` remains [0].***
