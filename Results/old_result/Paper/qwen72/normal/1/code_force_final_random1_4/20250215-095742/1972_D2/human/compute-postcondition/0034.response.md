The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing from 3 to 4. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. Since `math.gcd(x, y)` (which is `math.gcd(2, 4)`) equals 2, which is not 1, `cnt` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 10, `m` must be at least 15, `x` is 2, `y` is 4, `cnt` remains unchanged.**
