Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000. All other variables (`s`, `sl`, `pk`, `ele`, `final`, `n`, `i`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
    one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in the list `sl`, `lst` is an empty list unless `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both at least 50, in which case `lst` is `[1]`. `mini` is 100000000, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, and all other variables (`s`, `sl`, `pk`, `ele`, `final`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged. If `s[0]` is '0', `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, and `zero_perc` is 100. Otherwise, `zero` is 0, `one` is 1, and `zero_perc` is 0. `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in the list `sl`, `lst` is `[2]` if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both at least 50, otherwise `lst` is `[1]`. `mini` is 100000000, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 1, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `ele`, `final` remain unchanged. If `s[0]` is '0', `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, and `zero_perc` is now 50. If `s[0]` is '1', `zero` is 0, `one` is 1, and `zero_perc` is now 0. If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is incremented by 1, `one` remains 0, and `zero_perc` is now 50. If `s[i]` is '1', `one` is incremented by 1, `zero` remains 0, and `zero_perc` is now 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `lst` is `[2, 3]` if both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50, otherwise `lst` is `[1]`. `mini` is 100000000, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `ele`, `final` remain unchanged, `zero` is 1 or 0 depending on whether `s[0]` is '0' or '1', `one` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[0]` is '0' or '1', `zero_perc` is 50 if `s[0]` is '0' or 0 if `s[0]` is '1'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
