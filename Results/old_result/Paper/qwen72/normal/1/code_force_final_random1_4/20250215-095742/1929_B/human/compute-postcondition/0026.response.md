To determine what will be printed by the `print(2 * n)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `s` is the content of the fourth line.
   - `n` is the first integer from splitting `s`.
   - `k` is the second integer from splitting `s`.

2. **Conditions for `k`:**
   - If `k` is less than or equal to \(4 * n - 4\), then `k` retains this value.
   - If `k` is greater than \(4 * n - 4\), then `k` retains its original value unless it is specifically \(4 * n - 3\) or \(4 * n - 2\), in which case `k` also retains these values.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(2 * n)`.

### Analysis:
- The value of `n` is derived from the first integer in the split of `s`.
- The value of `k` is derived from the second integer in the split of `s`.
- The conditions for `k` do not affect the value of `n`.
- The print statement only involves `n` and calculates `2 * n`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the value of `2 * n`, where `n` is the first integer from splitting the string `s`.

Output: **2 * n (where n is the first integer from splitting the string s)**
