The code `l.pop(-1)` removes the last element from the list `l`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `k` is `k - (n - 2) + 1`.
- `x` is `2`.
- `l` is a list containing integers from `n` to `2` in descending order, with `n - 1` inserted at the beginning and the last element `1` removed.

After executing `l.pop(-1)`, the last element of `l` is removed. Since `l` initially contains integers from `n` to `2` in descending order, with `n - 1` inserted at the beginning and the last element `1` removed, the last element of `l` before the pop operation is `2`.

Therefore, after the pop operation, the list `l` will contain integers from `n` to `3` in descending order, with `n - 1` inserted at the beginning.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `k` is `k - (n - 2) + 1`, `x` is `2`, and `l` is a list containing integers from `n` to `3` in descending order, with `n - 1` inserted at the beginning.**
