To determine what will be printed by the `print(nx)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\).
2. `j` is `n + 1`.
3. `nx` is a string constructed from the `i`-th input string in `xx` where the corresponding character is not '?'.
4. For positions where the character is '?':
   - If the index `i` or the current position `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, `nx` will contain 'S'.
   - Otherwise, `nx` will contain 'F'.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the range of `n` and `j`:**
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 24.
   - `j` is `n + 1`, so `j` will be an integer between 3 and 25.

2. **Construct the string `nx`:**
   - `nx` is built from the `i`-th input string in `xx`.
   - For each character in the `i`-th input string:
     - If the character is not '?', it is directly included in `nx`.
     - If the character is '?':
       - Check if the index `i` or the current position `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`.
       - If true, append 'S' to `nx`.
       - Otherwise, append 'F' to `nx`.

3. **First Quarter of the List `sb`:**
   - The first quarter of the list `sb` would be the first \(\frac{len(sb)}{4}\) elements.
   - Since `sb` is not explicitly defined, we assume it is a list of length at least 4 (to have a first quarter).

### Example Construction:
Let's assume `xx` is a list of strings and `sb` is a list of integers for illustration purposes:
- Suppose `xx = ["AB?C", "DE?F", "GHIJ"]`.
- Suppose `sb = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.

For `n = 3`:
- `j = n + 1 = 4`.
- We need to construct `nx` from the 3rd string in `xx`, which is "GHIJ".

Since there are no '?' characters in "GHIJ", `nx` will be "GHIJ".

For `n = 2`:
- `j = n + 1 = 3`.
- We need to construct `nx` from the 2nd string in `xx`, which is "DE?F".

- The 2nd string "DE?F" has one '?' character at index 2.
- Check if index 2 or position 3 is in the first quarter of `sb`:
  - The first quarter of `sb` is `[1, 2]`.
  - Index 2 is in the first quarter, so the '?' at index 2 will be replaced with 'S'.
- Therefore, `nx` will be "DESF".

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the construction rules, the output of the `print(nx)` statement will depend on the specific values of `n`, `j`, and the content of `xx` and `sb`.

However, without the exact values of `xx` and `sb`, we can generalize the output as follows:

Output: **nx (where nx is a string constructed from the i-th input string in xx, replacing '?' with 'S' if the index i or the current position j is in the first quarter of the list sb, otherwise replacing '?' with 'F')**
