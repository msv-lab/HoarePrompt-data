To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop head:

```python
for ii in range(tt):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `ii` and `tt`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values provided by the user input.
   - `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5).
   - `y` is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x.
   - The second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
   - `tt` must be greater than 0.
   - `ii` is 0.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the user input and must have at least `x` elements.
   - `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
   - `ans` is the final value after all iterations of the loop plus the value of `y`.
   - `tmp` contains the values added during the loop execution.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop variable `ii` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - The loop condition is `ii < tt`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` must be less than `tt`.

### Adjusted State:
- `ii` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1.
- `tt` remains the same as it is the upper limit for the loop.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, the second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the user input and must have at least `x` elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations of the loop plus the value of `y`, `tmp` contains the values added during the loop execution.**
