Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list with the first element set to 1 and the rest are `None`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`, and the value of `visited[i]` is `False`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `bipartite = True` sets the variable `bipartite` to `True`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
