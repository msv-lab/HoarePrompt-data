Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 50,000.
- `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).

The print statement is:
```python
print(2 * k - 1)
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to evaluate the expression `2 * k - 1`:

1. **Value of `k`**: Since `k` is a positive integer and it is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\), `k` can take any value from 1 up to \((n + 1) // 2\).
2. **Expression `2 * k - 1`**: This expression calculates an odd number because multiplying `k` by 2 results in an even number, and subtracting 1 from an even number always results in an odd number.

Therefore, the output will be an odd number that is calculated as `2 * k - 1`.

Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is a positive integer between 1 and (n + 1) // 2)**
