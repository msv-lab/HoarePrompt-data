Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and three lists of integers `x`, `y`, and `r` from user input, where each list has `n` elements. It then processes these lists using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to determine if a certain condition related to the bipartiteness of a graph is met. The function updates the `visited` and `coef` lists during this process. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the graph is bipartite and at least one node has been processed, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. **
