Output State: **All monsters whose health could be reduced to 0 with the available bullets have been defeated. The `rest` variable is now equal to `k - delta`. The `pos` variable points to the next monster in the `sorted_indices` list that still has health greater than 0, and `pos` must not be equal to the length of `sorted_indices`. The `a` list contains the remaining health of each monster, where some elements may be 0 if those monsters have been defeated. The `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, and `len(sorted_indices)` variables remain unchanged as they were not modified within the loop, except `distance` which is now `distance + 1`. The `delta` variable is now equal to the minimum of the original `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`.**
