The code snippet `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. This operation does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **All elements in `b_values` have been processed, `cnt_b[i]` is `0` for each unique element `i` in `b_values`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `i` is the last element in `b_values`.**
