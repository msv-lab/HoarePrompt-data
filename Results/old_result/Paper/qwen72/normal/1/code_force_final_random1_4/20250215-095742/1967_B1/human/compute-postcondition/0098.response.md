The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters within its definition. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should operate with two positive integers, `n` and `m`, where both are within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. The specific output or return value of the function is not provided in the problem statement, so I cannot accurately describe what the function returns without additional information.

However, if we assume that the function is designed to return some result based on the values of `n` and `m`, the general description would be:

Functionality: **The function operates with two positive integers, `n` and `m`, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The exact return value is not specified, but it is expected to produce a result based on the values of `n` and `m`.**
