Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **List `l`**: This is a list of integers from user input.
2. **Variable `i`**: This is the difference between the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `b` and the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `a-1` in `l`.
3. **List `p`**: This is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`.
4. **Variable `j`**: This is the count of `1`s in `l`.
5. **List `c`**: This is a list where each element is the cumulative count of `1`s in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`.
6. **Variables `n` and `m`**: These must be greater than 0.
7. **Variable `_`**: This is 0.
8. **Variables `a` and `b`**: These are integers from user input.
9. **Variable `s`**: This is the difference between the cumulative sum at index `b` and the cumulative sum at index `a-1` in `p`.
10. **Condition**: Either \( b - a + 1 \leq 1 \) or \( s - (b - a + 1) < i \).

Given the condition:
- If \( b - a + 1 \leq 1 \), it means the range between `a` and `b` is very small (either 0 or 1).
- If \( s - (b - a + 1) < i \), it means the difference between the cumulative sum and the length of the range is less than the difference in the cumulative count of `1`s.

In both cases, the condition ensures that the range between `a` and `b` is either very small or the sum of the elements in the range is not significantly larger than the number of `1`s in the range.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables and the conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **NO**
