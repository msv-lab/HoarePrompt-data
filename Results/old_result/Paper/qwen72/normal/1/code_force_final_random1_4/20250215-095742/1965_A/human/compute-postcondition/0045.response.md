Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `j` is the index where the loop broke out or reached the end of the list `lis`, `test` is False if it was set to False during the loop execution or remains unchanged if it was initially False.**

Explanation:
- The line `lis = sorted(set(l))` creates a new list `lis` which contains the unique elements from the map object `l`, sorted in ascending order.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `j`, and `test` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`.
