Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then computes a string based on the counts of elements in the reversed list and maps these counts to corresponding letters from the alphabet. The function prints the resulting string for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state includes the printed results for each test case, and the input variables are no longer needed. **
