Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the input, `f` is equal to the second element of `feat`, `a` is equal to the third element of `feat`, `b` is equal to the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `array2` now contains one element which is the result of `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the result of `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a` to the list `array2`. Since `i` is 2, `arr[i]` is the third element of `arr`, and `arr[i - 1]` is the second element of `arr`. The value of `a` is the third element of `feat`. The other variables remain unchanged.
