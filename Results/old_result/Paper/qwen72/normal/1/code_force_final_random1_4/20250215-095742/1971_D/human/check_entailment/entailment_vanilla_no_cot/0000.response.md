Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The logic in the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The goal is to find the minimum number of pieces such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string. However, the program incorrectly increments the `count` every time it encounters a change in the character from '0' to '1' or vice versa, which does not necessarily reflect the minimum number of cuts required.

The correct approach should be to count the number of '1's that appear before any '0'. This is because each '1' that appears before a '0' requires a separate piece to ensure that the final arrangement can be sorted. If there are no '1's before any '0', then the string is already sorted, and only one piece is needed.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input()
        # Count the number of '1's before the first '0'
        count = 0
        has_zero = False
        for char in s:
            if char == '0':
                has_zero = True
            elif has_zero and char == '1':
                count += 1
        # If there are no '1's before any '0', the string is already sorted
        if count == 0:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(count + 1)
```

This version correctly counts the number of pieces needed to sort the binary string.
