Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is a placeholder (not used in the print statement).
   - `n` is greater than 2 (not used in the print statement).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `res` is the new input string.
   - If `res` is `<`, then:
     - `k` is updated to 1.
     - `best` is set to 1.
   - Otherwise:
     - `k` remains the largest index `i` for which the input was `<` (or 1 if no input was `<`).
     - `best` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - The value of `k` and `best` depends on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is `<`, then `k` is 1 and `best` is 1.
     - If `res` is not `<`, then `k` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<` (or 1 if no input was `<`), and `best` is 0.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - **Scenario 1:** If `res` is `<`:
     - `k` is 1.
     - `best` is 1.
     - The print statement will output: `? 1 1 1 2`.
   - **Scenario 2:** If `res` is not `<`:
     - `k` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<` (or 1 if no input was `<`).
     - `best` is 0.
     - The print statement will output: `? [k] 0 [k] 2`, where `[k]` is the value of `k`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both scenarios.
   - If `res` is `<`, the output will be: `? 1 1 1 2`.
   - If `res` is not `<`, the output will be: `? [k] 0 [k] 2`, where `[k]` is the value of `k`.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be one of the following:

- If `res` is `<`:
  Output: **? 1 1 1 2**
- If `res` is not `<`:
  Output: **? [k] 0 [k] 2 (where [k] is the largest index i for which the input was < or 1 if no input was <)**

To provide a more precise answer, we need to know the value of `res`. However, based on the given information, the output will be one of the two formats above.
