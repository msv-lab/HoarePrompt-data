The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. 

- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains:
  - A tuple `(n, m)` where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of problems in the bank, and `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 5) representing the number of upcoming rounds.
  - A string `a` of length `n`, consisting of uppercase letters 'A' to 'G', representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

The function returns a list named `results` containing `t` elements. Each element in `results` corresponds to a test case and represents the value of `missing` for that test case. The `missing` value is calculated as the sum of `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, where `freq` is a list of 7 integers representing the frequency of characters 'A' to 'G' in the string `a` from the respective tuple in `test_cases`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. For each test case, it calculates the number of missing problems needed to meet the required number of problems for the upcoming rounds. It returns a list of these values for all test cases.**
