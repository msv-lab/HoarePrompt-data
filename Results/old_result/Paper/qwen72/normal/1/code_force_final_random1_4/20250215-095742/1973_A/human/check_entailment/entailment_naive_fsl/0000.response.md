Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, the condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:` is too restrictive. For example, consider the input `(0, 2, 4)`. The total points are 6, which is even, and the total matches are 3. However, the program incorrectly returns `-1` because `p3 > total_matchs` evaluates to `4 > 3`, which is true. This is incorrect because it is possible to achieve the scores `(0, 2, 4)` with 2 draws and 1 win/loss game:

- Player 1 vs Player 2: Draw (1 point each)
- Player 1 vs Player 2: Draw (1 point each)
- Player 2 vs Player 3: Player 3 wins (2 points to Player 3)

Thus, the correct output for this case should be `2`, but the program returns `-1`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
