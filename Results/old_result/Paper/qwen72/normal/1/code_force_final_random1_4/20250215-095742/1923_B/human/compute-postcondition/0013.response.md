The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and assigns the first part to `n` and the second part to `k` after converting them to integers.

- The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, and `x` is a new list of integers input by the user.
- After executing the code, `n` and `k` are updated with the new input values.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is a new list of integers input by the user.**
