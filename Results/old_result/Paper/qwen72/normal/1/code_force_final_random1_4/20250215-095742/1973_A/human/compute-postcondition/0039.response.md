The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. This means no further changes are made to the variables within the current iteration. The values of `t`, `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_points`, and `total_matchs` remain unchanged. The list `resultats` is only modified if `total_points` is odd, but since the `continue` statement is executed, the condition for modifying `resultats` is not checked.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least three tuples. `p1` is the first element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`. `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`. The current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
