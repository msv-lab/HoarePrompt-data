You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`. It then calculates the number of adjacent character pairs in `s` that are different. If there is at least one pair where the first character is '0' and the second is '1', the count is decremented by 1. The function prints the final count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that `t` is 0, `i` is `t-1`, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, and `count` is the calculated value for the last test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string is already sorted but has multiple consecutive '1's or '0's. For example, consider the input `11111111`. According to the problem description, the output should be `1` because the string is already sorted. However, the current implementation will output `8`, which is incorrect.

To illustrate this issue, let's break down the execution of the program with the input `11111111`:
- The loop iterates through the string, and since all characters are the same, `s[j] == s[j + 1]` is always true.
- The `count` variable increments for each iteration, leading to a final count of `8`.

This behavior is incorrect because the string is already sorted, and no cuts are needed. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
