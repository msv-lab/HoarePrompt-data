Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, the array `a`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Function Definition (`func_1`)**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements being removed, and two pointers `l` and `r` to track the left and right ends of the array `a`.
   - **Processing Commands**: For each command in `s`, it checks if the command is 'L' or 'R':
     - If 'L', it appends the leftmost element of `a` to `b` and increments `l`.
     - If 'R', it appends the rightmost element of `a` to `b` and decrements `r`.
   - **Cumulative Product Calculation**: After processing all commands, it calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` modulo `m`, starting from the last element and moving towards the first. This is stored in the list `ans`.
   - **Return Value**: The function returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which matches the required output format.

3. **Output**: The main loop calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats, processes the commands as specified, and computes the required cumulative products. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
