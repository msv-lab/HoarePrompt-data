To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given program state and the `while` loop condition.

### Program State Before the Loop:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is the length of the list `arr`.
- `nums` is a Counter object containing the counts of each integer in `arr`.
- `start` is 0.
- `vis` is an empty set.

### While Loop Condition:
```python
while nums.get(start, 0):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop condition checks if `nums.get(start, 0)` is truthy. This means the loop will execute if `nums[start]` is greater than 0.
- `start` is initially 0.
- For the loop to execute, `nums[0]` must be greater than 0. This means that the integer 0 must appear at least once in the list `arr`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `start`.
- However, since `start` is 0 and the loop condition depends on `nums[0]`, we need to ensure that `nums[0]` is greater than 0.
- Given the initial state, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\). Therefore, if `arr` contains any 0s, `nums[0]` will be greater than 0.

### Conclusion:
- Since `start` is 0 and the loop condition depends on `nums[0]`, we need to ensure that `nums[0]` is greater than 0.
- The initial state already ensures that `arr` contains integers from 0 to \(n-1\), so if `arr` contains at least one 0, `nums[0]` will be greater than 0.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is the length of the list `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object containing the counts of each integer in `arr`. `start` is 0. `vis` is an empty set.**
