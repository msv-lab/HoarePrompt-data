The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `ans`.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than `2m`, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `b` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is `m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` plus 1; otherwise, `ans` is 0 plus 1.**
