Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input provided by the user, `i` is the index where `a[i]` is no longer equal to `b[i]` or `len(a)` (whichever is smaller) plus 2, and `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, `new` is a list where each element up to index `i-2` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `i-2`, the element at index `i-1` is `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, and the rest are `None` values, `new2` is a list where each element up to index `i-2` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `i-2`, the element at index `i-1` is `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, and the rest are `None` values.**
