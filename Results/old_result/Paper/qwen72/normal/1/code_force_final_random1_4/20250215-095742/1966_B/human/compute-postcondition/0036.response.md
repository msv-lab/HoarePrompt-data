The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the condition `i < n - 1` to hold true.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is the integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` user input strings, `i` is 2, `j` is `m-2`, `ans` is 'NO'. If the first character of the string at index `i` in `gr` is different from the first character of the string at index `i + 1` in `gr` or the last character of the string at index `i` in `gr` is different from the last character of the string at index `i + 1` in `gr`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.**
