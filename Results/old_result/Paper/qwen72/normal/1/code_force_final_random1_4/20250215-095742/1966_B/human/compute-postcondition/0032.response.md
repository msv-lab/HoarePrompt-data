Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is the integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` user input strings, `i` is 0, `j` is `m-2`, `impossible` is True if the first character of the string at index `i` in `gr` is the same as the first character of the string at index `i + 1` in `gr` and the last character of the string at index `i` in `gr` is the same as the last character of the string at index `i + 1` in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` is False. `ans` is 'NO'.***
