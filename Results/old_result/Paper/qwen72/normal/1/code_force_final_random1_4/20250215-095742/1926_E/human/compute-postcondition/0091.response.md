Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is `t - 1` (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it.)
- `t` remains unchanged (This variable is also not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it.)
- `n` is 0
- `k` is the second input integer
- `m` is the last computed value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0 or non-positive
- `L` is a list containing at least one value of `(n + 1) // 2` computed during the loop
- `tot` is 0
- `pow` is 1
- `a` is the first element in `L`
- The current value of `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`

### Print Statement:
```python
print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `pow` is 1
   - `k` is the second input integer
   - `tot` is 0
   - `a` is the first element in `L`

2. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition states that `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`.
   - Since `tot` is 0, this simplifies to `0 < k <= a`.

3. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - The expression inside the print statement is `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`
   - Substituting the known values:
     - `pow` is 1
     - `tot` is 0
     - The expression becomes `1 * (2 * (k - 0) - 1) = 2 * k - 1`

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The value printed will be `2 * k - 1`

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the value `2 * k - 1`, where `k` is the second input integer.

Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is the second input integer)**
