The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and `k` is a non-negative integer representing the required Manhattan value. The function returns different results based on the conditions:

- **Case_1**: If `k` is 0, the function returns a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- **Case_2**: If `k` is an even number greater than 0, the function returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`, where `c` is 1, `k` is `k // 2`, and `l` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- **Case_3**: If `k` is 1, the function returns the result of `func_3(1, l)`.
- **Case_4**: If `k` is an odd number greater than 1 and can be expressed as `k // 2 - (n - 2) + 1` which is greater than or equal to 1, the function returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`, where `c` is 2, `k` is calculated as `k // 2 - (n - 2) + 1`, and `l` is the result of `func_3(1, l)`.
- **Case_5**: If `k` is 0 after the above conditions, the function returns the result of `func_3(c, l)`, where `c` is 3 and `l` is the result of `func_3(3, l)` from the initial state.
- **Case_6**: If `k` is greater than 1 and can be expressed as `k - (n - 2) + 1`, the function returns the result of `func_2(3, k, l)`, where `k` is calculated as `k - (n - 2) + 1` and `l` is the result of `func_3(3, l)`. If `k` is 0, the function returns the result of `func_3(3, l)` instead.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, and `k` is a non-negative integer representing the required Manhattan value. Depending on the value of `k`, the function returns a list or the result of another function call (`func_2` or `func_3`) with specific parameters.**
