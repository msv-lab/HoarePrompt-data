The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the current iteration count. The loop iterates a fixed number of times determined by the result of `int(input())`. Since the loop does not depend on the values of `t` or `p` for its execution, these values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. The loop simply needs to decrement the internal counter that tracks the number of iterations left, but this counter is not explicitly represented in the state.

Given that the loop is set to run a specific number of times, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same for `t` and `p`, while the implicit iteration counter (represented by `_`) is incremented.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `p` is a list of four even integers derived from the input, where each element is the nearest even number less than or equal to the corresponding `p_i` value.**
