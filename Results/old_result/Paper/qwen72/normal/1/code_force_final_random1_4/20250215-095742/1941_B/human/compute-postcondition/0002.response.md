The code snippet `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts using whitespace as the delimiter, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of an integer `n` where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9, representing the elements of the array.
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- The input value for the loop is `t` and must be greater than 0.
- `a` is an input integer.

After executing the code snippet:
- `b` is now a list of integers read from the input.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers read from the input.**
