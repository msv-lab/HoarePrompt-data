The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` are integers provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing one user input string, `i` is 1**
