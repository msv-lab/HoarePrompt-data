Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", with a length not exceeding 500,000, and it is a balanced parentheses sequence; `n` is the length of `s` and does not change; `balance_info` is a list containing `n` elements, each a `BalanceInfo` object. Each `BalanceInfo` object in the list has `balance` set to the cumulative balance up to that index, `index` set to the corresponding index in the string `s`, and `char` set to the character at that index in `s`. The final value of `balance` is 0, as the string `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence.**

Explanation:
- The string `s` and its length `n` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- The list `balance_info` will contain `n` elements, each representing the balance, index, and character at each position in the string `s`.
- The `balance` variable starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 for every opening parenthesis '(' and decremented by 1 for every closing parenthesis ')'. Since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, the final value of `balance` will be 0 after the loop completes.
