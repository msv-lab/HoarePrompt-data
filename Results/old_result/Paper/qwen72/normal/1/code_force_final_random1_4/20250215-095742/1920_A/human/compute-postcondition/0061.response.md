Functionality: ** The function `func_7` reads an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and then processes `n` pairs of integers `(t, v)` from user input. It updates two boundary values, `start` and `end`, based on the type of operation specified by `t` (1, 2, or 3). If `t` is 1, it updates `start` to the maximum value of `v` encountered. If `t` is 2, it updates `end` to the minimum value of `v` encountered. If `t` is 3, it appends `v` to a list `num`. After processing all inputs, the function counts how many elements in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive). If `start` is greater than `end`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the count of elements in `num` that fall within this range, provided this difference is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0. **
