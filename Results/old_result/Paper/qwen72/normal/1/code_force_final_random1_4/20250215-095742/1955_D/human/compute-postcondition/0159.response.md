To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n - m`, where `n` is greater than `m`.
- The loop has completed all its iterations.
- `cnt_b` reflects the net count of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values`, adjusted by the loop operations.
- `curr` represents the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b`.
- `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.

### Explanation:
- The loop has completed, meaning all necessary computations have been performed.
- `cnt_b` is a dictionary or similar structure that keeps track of the counts of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values`.
- `curr` is a variable that counts how many of these elements have a non-negative count in `cnt_b`.
- `ans` is incremented every time `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### What is Printed:
- The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `b_values`, and `k` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total number of times curr was greater than or equal to k during the loop's execution)**
