The code `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of the dictionary `cnt_b` at the key corresponding to the element at index 0 of list `a` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is greater than `m`
- The element at index 0 of list `a` is in the set `b_values`

The element at index 0 of list `a` is accessed using `a[0]`. Let's denote this element as `a[0]`. The value of `cnt_b[a[0]]` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is 0, `n` is greater than `m`, the element at index 0 of list `a` is in the set `b_values`, and `cnt_b[a[0]]` is incremented by 1.**
