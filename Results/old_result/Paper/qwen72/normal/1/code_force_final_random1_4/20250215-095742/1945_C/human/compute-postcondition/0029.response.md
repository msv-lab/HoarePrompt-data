Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, if `n` is even, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, if `n` is odd, `pk` is also set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `zero` is 2, `one` is 0, and `zero_perc` is 100. Otherwise, `zero` is 0, `one` is 2, and `zero_perc` is 0. In both cases, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is a list containing `[1]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.***
