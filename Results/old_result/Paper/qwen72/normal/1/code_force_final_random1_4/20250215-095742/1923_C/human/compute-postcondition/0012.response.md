The code `c.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the end of the list `c`. Given that `c` initially contains a single element `[0]`, and `j` is 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 0, the new state of `c` will be `[0, j]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is a list containing elements [0, `i`], `c` is a list containing elements [0, `j`], `i` is 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `i` is 0, `j` is 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 0, and `x` remains 1 if `x` is 1.**
