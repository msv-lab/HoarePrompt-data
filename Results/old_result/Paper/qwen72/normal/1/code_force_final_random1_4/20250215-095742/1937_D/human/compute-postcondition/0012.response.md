Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `s[0]` is '>', then `idx_A` is a list containing `[0]` if it was initially empty, otherwise `idx_A` is a list containing one more element than before, which is `0`. If `idx_A` was initially empty, then `A` is a list containing `[0]` and `idx_A` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `A` is a list containing one element which is `(0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, and `idx_A` is not an empty list. If `s[0]` is not '>', then `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged.***
