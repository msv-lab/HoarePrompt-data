The code snippet `ans += ss` appends the value of `ss` to the string `ans`. Given that `ans` was initially an empty string and `ss` is the third character of `s`, after executing this line, `ans` will contain the third character of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the third character of `s`, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus 97, `cur` is 0.**
