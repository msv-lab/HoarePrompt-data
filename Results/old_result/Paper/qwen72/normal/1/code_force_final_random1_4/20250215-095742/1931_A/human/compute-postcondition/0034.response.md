Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78). For each `n`, the function determines and prints the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded to `n`. Specifically, if `n` > 52, the word is the character at index `n - 53` from the lowercase English alphabet followed by 'zz'. If 26 < `n` ≤ 52, the word is 'a' followed by the character at index `n - 28` and then 'z'. If `n` ≤ 26, the word is 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3`. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
