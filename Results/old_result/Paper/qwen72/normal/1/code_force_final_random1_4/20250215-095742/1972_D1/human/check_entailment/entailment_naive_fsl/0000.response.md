Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the function `func_15` and `func_16` do not implement the logic required to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The function `func_15` appears to be attempting to solve a different problem, and it does not match the problem description at all. It calculates a value based on a loop that increments `i` and checks a condition involving `n` and `i`, but this logic is unrelated to the problem of finding pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.

A correct implementation would need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges and check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\). The current implementation does not do this, and therefore, it is incorrect.
