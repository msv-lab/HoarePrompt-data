Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is designed to handle the MEX operation on a subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - When `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not 0 and sets it to 0, appending the operation to `ops`.
   - For `l < r`, it recursively calls itself with `l + 1` to `r` and then checks if `a[l]` is not equal to the length of the subarray (`r - l + 1`). If so, it sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation to `ops`.
   - The logic ensures that the MEX operation is applied correctly and the subarray is updated accordingly.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` to maximize the sum of the array.
   - It then returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
   - The function correctly handles the initialization and finalization of the operations.

3. **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**:
   - This function recursively divides the array into subarrays and applies the MEX operation to maximize the sum.
   - It checks if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to the square of its length. If so, it applies the MEX operation and updates the subarray.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and recursively processes the left and right subarrays.
   - The function ensures that the MEX operation is applied optimally to maximize the sum.

4. **Function 4 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and operations, and prints the results.
   - It correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.

Overall, the program follows the correct logic to maximize the sum of the array using the MEX operation and ensures that the number of operations does not exceed the limit. The functions are well-structured and handle edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
