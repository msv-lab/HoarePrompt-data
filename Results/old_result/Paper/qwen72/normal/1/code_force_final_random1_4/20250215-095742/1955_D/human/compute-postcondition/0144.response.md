Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than `m`. If `a[1 + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[1 + m]]` is decremented by 1. If `a[1]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[1]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. Additionally, if `cnt_b[a[1 + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is increased by 1. If `a[1 + m]` is not in `b_values`, no changes are made to `cnt_b` or `curr`.***
