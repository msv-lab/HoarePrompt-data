The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is clear that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, with each test case involving two positive integers `a` and `b` within specified ranges. The function's output depends on the values of `a` and `b` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, `a` and `b` are positive integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `a` and `b` for each test case.**
