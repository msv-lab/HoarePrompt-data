To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

- The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, and this is correct as it is the starting point for the loop.
- The variable `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once. This is because the loop iterates over the range `n + 1`, which means if `n` is 0, the loop will not run (since `range(1)` would only include the index 0, but the loop starts with `i` already set to 0).

Given these conditions, the state should be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `suf` and the corresponding element in `l`, `i` is 0, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value of the suffix sums up to that index in `suf`, `sm` is -111**
