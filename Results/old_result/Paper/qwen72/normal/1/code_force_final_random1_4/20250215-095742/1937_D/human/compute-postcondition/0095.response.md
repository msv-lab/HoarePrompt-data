Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the character at index 0 of `s` is not '>', `r` is decreased by 1, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `l` is not equal to 0, `a` is the element at index `l - 1` of `A` plus `(0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is updated to `a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- Given `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `s`, `r`, `l`, and `A`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `a` is the original value of `a` plus the product of `(0 - idx_A[l - 1])` and `l`.
