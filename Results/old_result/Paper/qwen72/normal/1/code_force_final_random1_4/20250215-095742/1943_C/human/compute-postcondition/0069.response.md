To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code step by step:

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **Path Construction**:
   - The loop appends the predecessor of the last element in `path_ba` until it encounters `-1`.
   - The final state of `path_ba` is a list of predecessors starting from `b` and ending with the first vertex that has no predecessor (indicated by `-1`).

2. **Variables**:
   - `n` is `-1`, indicating the end of the path.
   - `_`, `u`, `v`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values.
   - The length of `path_ba` determines the values of `i`, `c1`, `c2`, and the contents of `ops`.

3. **Conditions**:
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
     - `i` is `ci`.
     - `ops` contains the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even:
     - `path_ba` is a list with a length of at least 9.
     - `i` is the last valid index in the range.
     - `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
     - `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
     - `n` is `-1`.
     - `ops` contains tuples for each valid `i` in the range, specifically `(c2 - 1, i)` and `(c2, i)`.

### Code Execution:
The `print` statement uses the `map` function to apply a lambda function to each tuple in `ops` and then prints the results separated by newlines.

```python
print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine the Length of `path_ba`**:
   - Let's assume `path_ba` has a length of 9 (since it is specified to be at least 9 if even).
   - Since the length is 9, it is odd.

2. **Odd Length Case**:
   - `i` is `ci`.
   - `ops` contains tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`.

3. **Determine `ci`**:
   - `ci` is the last valid index in the range, which is `8` (since the length of `path_ba` is 9).

4. **Construct `ops`**:
   - `ops` will be `[(c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 2), (c, 3), (c, 4), (c, 5), (c, 6), (c, 7), (c, 8)]`.

5. **Apply the Lambda Function**:
   - The lambda function `lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'` will transform each tuple `(c, i)` into a string `f'{c + 1} {i}'`.

6. **Generate the Output**:
   - For each tuple in `ops`, the output will be:
     - `f'{c + 1} 0'`
     - `f'{c + 1} 1'`
     - `f'{c + 1} 2'`
     - `f'{c + 1} 3'`
     - `f'{c + 1} 4'`
     - `f'{c + 1} 5'`
     - `f'{c + 1} 6'`
     - `f'{c + 1} 7'`
     - `f'{c + 1} 8'`

### Final Output:
Since `c` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we will use the placeholder `c` in the output.

Output: **c + 1 0
c + 1 1
c + 1 2
c + 1 3
c + 1 4
c + 1 5
c + 1 6
c + 1 7
c + 1 8**
