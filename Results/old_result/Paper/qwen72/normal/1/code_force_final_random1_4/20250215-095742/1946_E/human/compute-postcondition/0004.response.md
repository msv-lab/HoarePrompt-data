To address the task, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the program state:

Initial State: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that `b <= a`, and `b` is not equal to 0. Additionally, the current value of `a` is less than the current value of `b`.

Code Snippet:
```python
c, d = func_1(b, a)
```

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. The function `func_1` is called with arguments `b` and `a`.
2. The function `func_1` returns two values, which are assigned to `c` and `d`.
3. The values of `c` and `d` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided. However, since `func_1` is called with `b` and `a`, the values of `c` and `d` will be determined by the logic within `func_1`.

Since the implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we can state that `c` and `d` are now assigned the results of `func_1(b, a)`.

Output State:
**`a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that `b <= a`, and `b` is not equal to 0. Additionally, the current value of `a` is less than the current value of `b`. `c` and `d` are the results of `func_1(b, a)`.**
