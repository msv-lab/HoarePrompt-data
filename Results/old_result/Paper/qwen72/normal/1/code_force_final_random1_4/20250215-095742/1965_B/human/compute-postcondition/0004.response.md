The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the function call `func_10()`. The loop's execution depends on the return value of `func_10()`. For the loop to execute again, the return value of `func_10()` must still be greater than 0. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, it does not affect the loop's condition but is incremented by the loop mechanism.

At the end of the last iteration, `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, and `_` is 0 (or not initialized). For the loop to execute one more time, the return value of `func_10()` must still be greater than 0, and `_` will be incremented to 1.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, `_` is 1, the return value of `func_14()` has been printed to the standard output twice**
