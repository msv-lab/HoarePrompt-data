To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `i < len(a)`**
   - This condition checks if the index `i` is within the bounds of the list `a`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `a`.

2. **Condition 2: `a[i] == b[i]`**
   - This condition checks if the elements at index `i` in lists `a` and `b` are equal.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, so we need to ensure that `a[1]` is equal to `b[1]`.

### Adjustments Needed:

- **`i`**: The current value of `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must remain 1 (it will be incremented inside the loop).
- **`len(a)`**: The length of `a` must be greater than 1 for `i` to be less than `len(a)`.
- **`a[1]` and `b[1]`**: These elements must be equal for the second condition to hold true.

### Conclusion:

Given the current state, the loop will execute again if:
- `i` remains 1.
- `len(a)` is greater than 1.
- `a[1]` is equal to `b[1]`.

Since `i` is already 1 and we cannot change the length of `a`, we need to ensure that `a[1]` is equal to `b[1]`.

### Final State:

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the initial input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `i` is 1, `new` is a list where `new[0]` is `max(a[0], b[0])`, `new2` is a list of `None` with the same length as `a`, `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`, `a[1]` must be equal to `b[1]`**.
