Output State: **`array2` now contains three elements: `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`, `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`, and `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`. `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ `test_cases` â‰¤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, and `arr` is a list of integers.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`.
- Given that `i` is 3, the value appended is `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`.
- The initial state specifies that `array2` could contain one or two elements based on certain conditions. After appending, `array2` now contains three elements.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
