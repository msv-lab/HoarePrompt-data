The value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`. The value of `rest` remains `k - 2 * delta`, and `pos` is still the index of the next monster in `sorted_indices` with health greater than 0 and must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rest` is `k - 2 * delta`, `pos` is the index of the next monster in `sorted_indices` with health greater than 0 and must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`, `delta` is the minimum of `rest` before the subtraction and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`, all other variables remain unchanged.**
