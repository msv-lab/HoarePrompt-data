To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is just a placeholder used to iterate over the range of `t`, so it doesn't need to be explicitly set or adjusted.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the problem statement already specifies that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `t` is guaranteed to be greater than 0, and thus the loop will execute at least once.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the given conditions.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.**
