Reasoning:  
The provided solution checks specific conditions at the boundaries of the array (first and last elements) but does not consider the overall feasibility of making all elements zero through the allowed operations. The operations can only decrease the values in the array, and they must be applied in such a way that the total reduction matches the initial values exactly. Specifically, the key insight is that the sum of the elements in the array must be even for it to be possible to reduce all elements to zero, because each operation decreases the sum of the array by 4 (an even number).

Additionally, the solution incorrectly assumes that checking the first and last elements alone is sufficient to determine the possibility of reducing the array to zero. This is not a comprehensive check, as the middle elements also play a crucial role in determining the feasibility.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Check if the sum of the array is even.
2. Ensure that no element in the array is less than the sum of the absolute differences of its adjacent elements divided by 2, which ensures that the operations can be applied without resulting in negative values.

Given these considerations, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
