Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `False` values except possibly `visited[0]` which may be `True`, `coef` is a list with the first element set to 1 and the second element (index 1) also set to 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `True` if `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains `False`.** 

The variable `bipartite` is now set to `True`, and the condition for `ok` being `True` is updated accordingly. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
