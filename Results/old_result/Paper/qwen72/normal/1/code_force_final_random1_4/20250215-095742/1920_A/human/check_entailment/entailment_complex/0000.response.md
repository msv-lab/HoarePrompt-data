### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints (`n`) and processes each constraint using `func_7()`.

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - `func_7()` initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1000000000.0, which are appropriate initial values for the constraints.
   - It correctly updates `start` and `end` based on the type of constraint:
     - For type 1 (k ≥ x), it updates `start` to the maximum value of `x`.
     - For type 2 (k ≤ x), it updates `end` to the minimum value of `x`.
     - For type 3 (k ≠ x), it appends `x` to the list `num`.

3. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - After processing all constraints, the function counts how many elements in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive).
   - It checks if `start` is greater than `end`, in which case it returns 0 (no valid integers).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers as `end - start + 1` and subtracts the count of invalid integers in `num` that fall within this range.

4. **Output**:
   - The main loop collects the results of each test case and prints them.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all types of constraints and computes the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints for each test case.

**Correctness: **True****
