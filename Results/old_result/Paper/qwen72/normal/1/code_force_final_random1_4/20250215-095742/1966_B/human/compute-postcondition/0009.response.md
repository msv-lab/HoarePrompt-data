The code snippet `gr.append(input())` adds a new element to the list `gr`, which is obtained from user input. This impacts the list `gr` by adding a third string to it, making its length 3. The other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` are integers provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing three user input strings, `i` is 2.**
