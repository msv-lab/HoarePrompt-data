Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to efficiently find the segment where the query point lies, calculates the time taken to reach that point based on the speeds calculated for each segment, and outputs the result rounded down to the nearest integer. The program handles multiple test cases and queries as specified in the problem statement.
