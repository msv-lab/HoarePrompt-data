The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` updates the value of `cur` by adding `1` shifted left by the value of `cur_ss`. Let's break down the impact:

- `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97.
- `1 << cur_ss` shifts the binary number `1` left by `cur_ss` positions, which is equivalent to `2` raised to the power of `cur_ss`.
- `cur` is updated by adding this value to its current value.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `i` is 1 or `k`
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `s` is a new input string that must have at least 2 characters
- `cnt` is 0
- `ans` is an empty string
- `ss` is the second character of `s`
- `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97
- If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the first character of `s`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.

After executing the code snippet:
- `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1 or `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 2 characters, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97, `cur` is `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`**.
