### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For \(b = 1\), the condition \(a + 1\) being a multiple of \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\) is always true. Therefore, all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid, contributing \(n\) valid pairs.
   - For \(b > 1\), the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is more restrictive. Specifically, \(a\) must be such that \(a + b\) is divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `count` to 2 and starts a loop from 2 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\) (starting from 2), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values.
   - It uses the formula `g = int(n / count)` to find the maximum possible value of \(a\) that can satisfy the condition.
   - It then checks if `g` is less than `count - 1`. If so, it breaks the loop.
   - Otherwise, it updates the answer by adding the number of valid \(a\) values for the current \(b\).

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case when \(b = 1\) by initializing `ans` to `n`.
   - For \(b > 1\), the logic to calculate the number of valid \(a\) values is based on the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - However, the specific logic inside the loop might not be entirely clear or correct. The formula `g = int(n / count)` and the subsequent calculations might not accurately capture the required condition.
   - The condition `if g < countmins:` might be too restrictive and could lead to missing valid pairs.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The logic inside the loop might not correctly count the number of valid pairs for \(b > 1\).
   - The condition `if g < countmins:` might be too restrictive and could lead to missing valid pairs.
   - The formula `g = int(n / count)` and the subsequent calculations might not accurately capture the required condition.

### Detailed Evaluation:
- **Initialization and Loop:**
  - The program initializes `ans` to `n`, which correctly accounts for all pairs \((a, 1)\).
  - The loop starts from `count = 2` and iterates up to `m`.

- **Condition Checking:**
  - The condition `if g < countmins:` is used to break the loop if `g` is less than `count - 1`. This condition is too restrictive and might prematurely terminate the loop, leading to missed valid pairs.
  - The formula `g = int(n / count)` is used to find the maximum possible value of \(a\) that can satisfy the condition. However, this formula does not directly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

- **Update Logic:**
  - The update `ans += int(g / count) + 1` is intended to add the number of valid \(a\) values for the current \(b\). However, this update might not accurately reflect the number of valid pairs due to the incorrect condition checking and formula usage.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential issues in the logic inside the loop and the restrictive condition, the program does not seem to correctly implement the required solution.

Final: **False**
