The code concatenates the character 'a', the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 28`, and the character 'z' to the `word` string. Since `n` is an input integer greater than 26 and less than or equal to 52, `n - 28` will be between -2 and 24, which are valid indices for the `alphabet` list (assuming `alphabet` is a list of all lowercase English letters). The `i` variable remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 26 and less than or equal to 52, `word` is 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'**.
