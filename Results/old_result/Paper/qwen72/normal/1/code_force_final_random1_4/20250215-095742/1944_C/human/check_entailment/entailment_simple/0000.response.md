Reasoning:

The provided code aims to solve the problem of determining the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played their optimal moves. The key points to consider are:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics**: Alice and Bob take turns removing elements from `a`. Alice appends the chosen element to `c`, and Bob simply removes his chosen element. The goal is to find the MEX of `c` at the end of the game.

2. **Optimal Strategy**: Since Alice wants to maximize the MEX and Bob wants to minimize it, they will both play optimally. This means Alice will try to include as many small numbers as possible in `c`, while Bob will try to prevent this by removing those numbers.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` uses a `Counter` to keep track of the frequency of each number in `arr`.
   - It initializes `start` to 0 and iterates through the numbers, decrementing the count of the current number and the next number if it exists.
   - If the next number (`start + 1`) is not available, it prints `start + 1` and returns, indicating that `start + 1` is the MEX.
   - If the loop completes without finding a missing number, it prints `start`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic of the function correctly identifies the MEX by checking the availability of consecutive numbers starting from 0.
   - The use of `Counter` ensures that the frequency of each number is tracked accurately.
   - The loop correctly handles the scenario where the next number is not available, and it prints the correct MEX.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the MEX of the array `c` after the game is played optimally by Alice and Bob.

Correctness: **True**
