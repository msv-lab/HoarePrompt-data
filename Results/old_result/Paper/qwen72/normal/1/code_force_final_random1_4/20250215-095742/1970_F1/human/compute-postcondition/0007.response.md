Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is an empty list, `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' and the value (-1, -1), `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists, `points` is a list with values [0, 0], `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line from the standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings. This list is stored in the variable `line`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
