Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, let's carefully analyze the problem description and the solution step by step.

### Problem Description:
- We are given two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \).
- We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \( 1 \le a \le n \)
  - \( 1 \le b \le m \)
  - \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

### Provided Solution:
The provided solution consists of several functions, but the main function that appears to be solving the problem is `func_15` and `func_16`.

#### Function `func_15`:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

- This function reads \( n \) and \( m \) from input.
- It initializes a counter `ans` to 0.
- It iterates over `i` starting from 1, and for each `i`, it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`.
- Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

#### Function `func_16`:
```python
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
```

- This function reads the number of test cases `t` from input.
- For each test case, it calls `func_15` and writes the result to standard output.

### Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_7()` reads the values of \( n \) and \( m \) for each test case.

2. **Logic in `func_15`**:
   - The loop condition `while i * i <= n + i` is not directly related to the problem statement.
   - The expression \((n + i) // (i * i)\) does not seem to correspond to the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

3. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_15` does not appear to correctly implement the required condition for counting valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The loop and the calculation inside the loop do not align with the problem's constraints and conditions.

### Detailed Evaluation:
- **Loop Condition**: The loop condition `while i * i <= n + i` is not relevant to the problem. The problem requires checking pairs \((a, b)\) where \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
- **Calculation Inside Loop**: The expression \((n + i) // (i * i)\) does not match the required condition. It seems to be an arbitrary calculation that does not reflect the problem's requirements.
- **Return Value**: The final return value `ans - 1` is also not justified by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in `func_15` is not aligned with the required conditions for counting valid pairs \((a, b)\).

Final: **False**
