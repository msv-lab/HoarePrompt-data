To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `r` is decreased by 1 (though `r` is not used in the `print` statement, so it doesn't affect the output).
- `idx_A` is a list, but its specific values are not provided.
- `l` is an index into the list `idx_A`.

### Expression Analysis:
The expression inside the `print` statement is:
```python
n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2
```

Let's break it down:
1. **`n - i`**:
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - Therefore, `n - i` simplifies to `n - 1`.

2. **`(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `idx_A[l - 1]` is the element at index `l - 1` in the list `idx_A`.
   - The expression becomes `(1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`.

Combining these:
- The full expression is `n - 1 + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`.

### Simplification:
- Let's denote `idx_A[l - 1]` as `x` for simplicity.
- The expression becomes `n - 1 + (1 - x) * 2`.
- Expanding the multiplication: `n - 1 + 2 - 2x`.
- Simplifying further: `n + 1 - 2x`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of `n + 1 - 2 * idx_A[l - 1]` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Since the exact value of `idx_A[l - 1]` is not provided, we can only express the output in terms of `n` and `idx_A[l - 1]`.

Output: **n + 1 - 2 * idx_A[l - 1] (where n is greater than 1 and idx_A[l - 1] is the element at index l - 1 in the list idx_A)**
