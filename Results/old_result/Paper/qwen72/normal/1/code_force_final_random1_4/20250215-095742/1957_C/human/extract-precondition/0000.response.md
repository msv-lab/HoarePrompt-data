Precondition: **n is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, representing the number of moves already played. The function `func_1` should actually take more parameters to fully represent the problem, including the moves already played. However, based on the provided function definition, only `n` is given.**
