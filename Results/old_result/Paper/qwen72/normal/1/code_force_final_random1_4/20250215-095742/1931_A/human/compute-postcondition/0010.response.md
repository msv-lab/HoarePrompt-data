Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 26, `word` is 'aa' followed by the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet.**

Explanation: The code appends 'aa' and the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet to the `word` variable. Since `n` is between 1 and 26, `n - 3` will be between -2 and 23, which means the character added will be from the alphabet starting from the 1st character (a) up to the 23rd character (w). The other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged.
