To determine what will be printed by the `print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `_` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input.
- `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input.
- `i` is initially set to 0.
- If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, then:
  - `new` is a list where each element is `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.
  - `new2` is a list where each element is `max(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.
- Otherwise, `new` and `new2` remain unchanged, and `i` is the index where `a[i] != b[i]` or the length of `a` if all elements are equal.

### Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, it means `i` is still 0, and the lists `new` and `new2` will be constructed.
   - If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, it means `i` has been updated to the index where `a[i] != b[i]` or to the length of `a` if all elements are equal, and `new` and `new2` remain unchanged.

2. **Constructing `new2`:**
   - If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, `new2` will be a list where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.

3. **Printing `new2`:**
   - The `print` statement joins the elements of `new2` into a single string and prints it.

### Conclusion:
- If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, `new2` will contain the maximum values of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
- If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new2` will remain unchanged, but since `i` starts at 0 and is only updated if there is a mismatch, this case is less likely unless all elements are equal.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the conditions, the `print` statement will output the string representation of the list `new2`, which contains the maximum values of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.

Output: **''.join(str(x) for x in new2) (where new2 is a list where each element is max(a[i], b[i]) for all i from 0 to len(a) - 1)**
