Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `False` values except `visited[0]` which is `True`, `coef` is a list with the first element set to 1 and the rest might be updated, `tot` might be updated, `bipartite` might be `False`, `ok` is `True` if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains `True`.**

Explanation:
- The line `ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0` updates the value of `ok`.
- If `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0, then `ok` becomes `True`.
- If `bipartite` is `False` or `tot` is 0, `ok` remains `True` because the initial value of `ok` is `True`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`) remain unchanged.
