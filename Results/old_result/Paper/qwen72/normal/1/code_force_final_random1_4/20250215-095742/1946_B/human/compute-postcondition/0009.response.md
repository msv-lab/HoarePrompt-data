Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing two elements `[0, l[0]]`, `i` is 0**.

Explanation:
- The code `suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])` appends the sum of the first element of `suf` (which is 0) and the first element of `l` to the list `suf`.
- Initially, `suf` contains `[0]`. After the code executes, `suf` becomes `[0, l[0]]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
