Output State: **`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than or equal to \(2^{(n-1)}\), `n` is `log2(n_cases)`, `power` is `n`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `power` is less than `n`.
- Each iteration of the loop increments `power` by 1.
- The loop will stop when `power` becomes equal to `n`.

Given that `n` is defined as `log2(n_cases)`, the loop will execute `n - 1` times before `power` equals `n`.

- After the loop finishes, `power` will be equal to `n`.
- For the loop to execute `n - 1` times, `n_cases` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(n-1)}\).

Thus, the final output state is:
- `i` remains 2 (unchanged).
- `n_cases` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(n-1)}\) for the loop to execute `n - 1` times.
- `n` remains `log2(n_cases)`.
- `power` is `n`.
