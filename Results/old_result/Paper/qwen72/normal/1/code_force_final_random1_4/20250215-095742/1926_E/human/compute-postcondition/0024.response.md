Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing at least one element, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0, `tot` is `tot + a`, `pow` is 2. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the current value of `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `m`, and `pow` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `pow *= 2` multiplies the current value of `pow` by 2.
- Initially, `pow` is 1, so after executing `pow *= 2`, `pow` becomes 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `m`, and `tot`) remain unchanged.
- The condition about `tot` and `k` remains the same as in the initial state.
