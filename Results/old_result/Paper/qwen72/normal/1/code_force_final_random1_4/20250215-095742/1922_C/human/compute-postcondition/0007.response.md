Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[2] = 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0, and the difference between the second element of `l` and the first element of `l` is less than the difference between the first element of `l` and the element before it (which is undefined because `i - 1` is out of bounds, but the condition is still true).**
