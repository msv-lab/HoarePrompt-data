You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and each string s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, and for each iteration `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `s` was an input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. For each `s`, `a` was a set containing the unique characters from `s`. If `len(a) == 2`, then `a` contained exactly 2 unique characters, and 'NO' was printed. Otherwise, `a` contained a number of unique characters not equal to 2, `b` was a sorted string of `s`, and `c` was a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in descending order. If `b` (the sorted version of `s`) was equal to `s`, then `s` was already sorted in ascending order, and `c` was printed. Otherwise, `b` was printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes an integer `t` within the range 1 to 1000 and a string `s` of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10. The exact return value is not specified, but it likely involves some computation or transformation based on these inputs.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
