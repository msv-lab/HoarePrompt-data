Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then checks the following conditions for each pair of `a` and `b`: if both `a` and `b` are even, it prints 'yes'. If the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, it prints 'yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state of the program includes the values of `a` and `b` from the last test case, though these values are not retained for further use. **
