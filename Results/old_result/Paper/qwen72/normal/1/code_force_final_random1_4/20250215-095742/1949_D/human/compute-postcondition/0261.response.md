The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the end of the string `nx`. Since the initial state specifies that `nx` could be updated based on certain conditions (if `xx[i][1]` is not '?', `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][1]`; otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus the string 'S'; otherwise, `nx` is set to 'F'), the exact initial value of `nx` is not specified. However, regardless of its initial value, the code will append 'F' to `nx`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'F'.**
