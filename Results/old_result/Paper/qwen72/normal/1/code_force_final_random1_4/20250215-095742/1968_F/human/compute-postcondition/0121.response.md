Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `x` is 0, `results` contains 'YES'**. 

The code appends the string 'YES' to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
