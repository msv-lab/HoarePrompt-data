The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition but is expected to process input related to multiple test cases. Each test case involves integers `n` and `m` which define the lengths of two arrays `a` and `b`, respectively, and an even integer `k`. The arrays `a` and `b` contain positive integers. The function processes these inputs according to the specified constraints and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `m` (the sizes of arrays `a` and `b`), and an even integer `k`. It returns a result for each test case based on the elements of arrays `a` and `b` and the value of `k`.**
