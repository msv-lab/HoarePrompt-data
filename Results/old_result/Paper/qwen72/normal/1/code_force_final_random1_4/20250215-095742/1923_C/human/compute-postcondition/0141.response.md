Output State: **`l` remains a list of integers from user input, `i` is the difference between the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `b` and the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `a-1` in `l`, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`, `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`, `c` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of `1`s in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`, `n` and `m` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `s` is now equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.**
