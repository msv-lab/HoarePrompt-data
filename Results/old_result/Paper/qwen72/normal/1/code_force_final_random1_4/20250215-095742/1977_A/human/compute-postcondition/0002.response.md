The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 100, and `i` is 0. After executing the code, the values of `n` and `m` are updated based on the input, while the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**
