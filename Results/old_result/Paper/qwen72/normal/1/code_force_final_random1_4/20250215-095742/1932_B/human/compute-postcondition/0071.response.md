The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, where each element is a list containing two sublists: the first sublist contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of signs, and the second sublist contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), representing the periodicities of the signs.

The function processes each test case and returns a list named `results` containing `t` elements. Each element in `results` represents the final value of `current_year` after processing the corresponding test case from the `test_cases` list. The length of `results` is equal to the value of `t`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list `test_cases` containing `t` test cases. Each test case consists of a single integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing periodicities. The function returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element is the final value of `current_year` after processing the corresponding test case.**
