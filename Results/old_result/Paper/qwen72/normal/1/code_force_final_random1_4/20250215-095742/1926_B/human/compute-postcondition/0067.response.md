Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each involving a grid of '0's and '1's. It reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself. The function then counts the number of '1's in each row of the grid that contains at least one '1'. If the count of '1's in the first two rows is the same, it prints 'SQUARE'; otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'. After processing all test cases, the function has printed 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' for each test case based on the pattern of '1's in the grid. **
