The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the input, where `n` represents the length of `a` and must be between 1 and 18, and each element in `a` must be between 0 and 10^7. It then calls another function `func_2` with `a` as an argument, which returns three values: `s` (the sum of all elements in `a`), `m` (the maximum value in `a`), and `ops` (a list of tuples). The function prints `s` and `m`, followed by each pair `(l + 1, r + 1)` from `ops`. After the function concludes, `n` and `a` remain unchanged, `s` and `m` are the computed sum and maximum value, respectively, and `ops` has been fully iterated through and its contents printed.
