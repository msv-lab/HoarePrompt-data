The code snippet updates the value of `n` by assigning it the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`. Let's break down the impact:

- `n` is updated to the value found in the `previous` list at the index specified by the last element of `path_ba`.
- `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`, so `path_ba[-1]` is `b`.
- Therefore, `n` is now equal to `previous[b]`.

All other variables remain unchanged. The output state is:

Output State: **`n` is `previous[b]`, `_` is the second value returned by `bfs(0)`, `u` and `v` are the last integers read from the input and each decreased by 1, `u2vs` is a list of lists where each list contains the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex, `d` is the first value returned by `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.**
