Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 0, `t` is either 1 or 2, and `v` is an input integer. If `t` is 3, `num` is a list that now includes `v`, and `start` and `end` remain unchanged. If `t` is 1 and `start` < `v`, `start` is updated to `v`; otherwise, `start` remains unchanged. If `t` is 2 and `end` > `v`, `end` is updated to `v`; otherwise, `end` remains unchanged.***
