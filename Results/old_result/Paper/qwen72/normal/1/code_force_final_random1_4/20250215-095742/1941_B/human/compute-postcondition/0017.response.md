Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers from the input.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This code snippet does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
