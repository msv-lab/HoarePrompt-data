The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of integers `x` and `n` from the user. For each pair, it calculates the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `x - n * d` is non-negative and divisible by `d`. If no such divisor exists, it defaults to 1. The function prints the result for each test case. After all iterations, `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10^3, and for each iteration, `x` and `n` are updated to the values provided by the user, while the final printed value is the largest valid divisor found for each pair.
