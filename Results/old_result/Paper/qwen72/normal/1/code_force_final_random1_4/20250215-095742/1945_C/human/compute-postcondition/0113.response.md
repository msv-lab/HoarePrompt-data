Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - (n - 1) - 1)`, and `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 during the loop's execution. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `mini`, `final`, `c1`) remain unchanged.**
