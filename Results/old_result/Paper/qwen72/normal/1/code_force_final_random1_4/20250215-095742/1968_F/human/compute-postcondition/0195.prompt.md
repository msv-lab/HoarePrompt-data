Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` has been incremented by `2 * q_initial + 2`, `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, followed by an additional empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `{(0): [0]}`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `q` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` has been incremented by `2 * q_initial + 3`, `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, followed by an additional empty string, `n` must be at least 0, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `a[1]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `pf[1]` is now `a[1]`, `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs `{(0): [0], a[1]: [1]}`, `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `q` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` has been incremented by `2 * q_initial + 4`, `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, followed by an additional empty string, `n` must be at least 0, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `a[1]` which is now `int(data[idx - 2])` and `a[2]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `pf[1]` is now `a[1]`, `pf[2]` is now `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs `{(0): [0], a[1]: [1], pf[2]: [2]}`, and `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `q` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` has been incremented by `2 * q_initial + 5`, `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, followed by an additional empty string, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `a[1]` which is now `int(data[idx - 3])`, `a[2]` which is now `int(data[idx - 2])`, and `a[3]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `pf[1]` is now `a[1]`, `pf[2]` is now `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `pf[3]` is now `pf[2] ^ a[3]`, `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs `{(0): [0], a[1]: [1], pf[2]: [2], pf[3]: [3, i]}` if `pf[3]` is in `mp`. If `pf[3]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[3]]` is `[3]`, and `i` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
