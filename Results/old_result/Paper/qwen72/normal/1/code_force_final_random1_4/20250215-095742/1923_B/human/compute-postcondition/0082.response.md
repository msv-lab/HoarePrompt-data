The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `a`, `x`, and `k`. `a` is a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster relative to the player's position, and `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second. The lengths of `a` and `x` are equal, and for all elements `x_i` in `x`, `x_i` â‰  0.

The function returns:
- **Case_1:** False
- **Case_2:** False
- **Case_3:** False
- **Case_4:** True

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `a`, a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster; `x`, a list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster relative to the player's position; and `k`, a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second. The function returns `True` in a specific case (Case_4) and `False` in other cases (Case_1, Case_2, Case_3).**
