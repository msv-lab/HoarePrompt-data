Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Precomputation**: The program precomputes the sum of digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores these values in the list `A`. This is efficient and ensures that each test case can be answered in constant time.

2. **Digit Sum Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number. It iterates through each digit, adds it to the sum, and continues until the number is reduced to zero.

3. **Sum Accumulation**: The main loop accumulates the sum of digit sums for each number from 1 to 200,000 and stores these cumulative sums in the list `A`.

4. **Test Case Handling**: For each test case, the program reads the input `n`, looks up the precomputed sum in the list `A`, and prints the result. This ensures that the program handles multiple test cases efficiently.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as `n = 1`, `n = 2`, and `n = 200000` correctly. The precomputation step ensures that all possible values of `n` within the specified range are covered.

Given that the program follows the problem description for every potential case and handles all edge cases correctly, it is deemed correct.
