The only object in the loop head is the variable `prob`, which is an element from the iterable `a`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in `a` to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, the state was:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000)
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples
- `results` is a list containing the original element and the value of `missing`
- `n` is the first element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`
- `m` is the second element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`
- `a` is the third element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty iterable
- `freq` is a list where the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by 1
- `missing` is the sum of max(0, m - f) for each f in `freq`
- `_` is incremented by 1

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `a` must be available. Therefore, `prob` will be the next element in the iterable `a`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the original element and the value of `missing`, `n` is the first element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty iterable, `freq` is a list where the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by 1, `missing` is the sum of max(0, m - f) for each f in `freq`, `_` is incremented by 1, `prob` is the next element in `a`**
