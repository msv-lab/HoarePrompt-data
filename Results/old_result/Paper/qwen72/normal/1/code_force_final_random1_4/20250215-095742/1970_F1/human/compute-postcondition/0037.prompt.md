Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' and the value (-1, -1), `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists, `points` is a list with values [0, 0], `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' and the value (-1, -1). If `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements` also has a key which is the first element of `line` and the value (0, 0). `points` is a list with values [0, 0], `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and must have at least one element, `ind` is 0. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key being the first element of `line` and the value being `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is false, `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary. If the second character of the first element of `line` is 'G', then `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list is empty and the second list contains the tuple (0, 0), and `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists and `tmp` is not modified. If `line[ind]` is '..', `elements`, `allPlayers`, and `goal` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd. `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`. `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' and the value (-1, -1). If `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements` also has a key which is the first element of `line` and the value (0, 0), and a key `line[1]` with the value (0, 1). `points` is a list with values [0, 0]. `i` is 0. `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and must have at least one element. `ind` is 1. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key `line[ind]` and the value `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is false, `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary. If the second character of the first element of `line` is 'G', then `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list is empty and the second list contains the tuple (0, 0), and `tmp` is 1. If the second character of the first element of `line` is not 'G', then `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists and `tmp` is not modified. Additionally, if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is false and the first character of `line[1]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0, otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple (0, 1) appended to its existing list. If `line[ind]` is '..', `elements`, `allPlayers`, and `goal` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' and the value (-1, -1). If `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements` also has the key `line[ind]` with the value (0, 2), the key `line[0]` with the value (0, 0), and the key `line[1]` with the value (0, 1). `points` is a list with values [0, 0], `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and must have at least one element, `ind` is 2. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key `line[ind]` and the value `False`. If the second character of the first element of `line` is 'G', then `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list is empty and the second list contains the tuple (0, 0), and `tmp` is 1. If the second character of the first element of `line` is not 'G', then `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists and `tmp` is not modified. Additionally, if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is false and the first character of `line[1]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0, otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple (0, 1) appended to its existing list. If `line[ind]` is '..', `elements`, `allPlayers`, and `goal` remain unchanged. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is false, `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary, and if the second character of the first element of `line` is 'G', then `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list is empty and the second list contains the tuple (0, 0), and `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuples (0, 0) and (0, 1) appended to its existing list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
