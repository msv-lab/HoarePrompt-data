Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` is a list of four integers where 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers, and `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in the list `a`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`p_i`**: Remains a list of four integers where each integer is between 0 and 200, as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`a`**: The list of integers provided as input. The loop iterates over each element of `a`, but the list itself is not modified.
- **`cnt`**: Initially, `cnt` could be 0 or 1 based on the initial conditions. After the loop completes, `cnt` will be the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in the list `a`. This means that for each integer `x` in `a`, `cnt` is incremented by the largest integer less than or equal to `x / 2`.
