Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ntest` must be equal to the initial value of `ntest`, `itest` is `ntest - 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: For each iteration, `n` is read from the input and represents the number of elements in the list `a`.
- **`a`**: In each iteration, `a` is read from the input, sorted, and then the difference between the largest and smallest elements is printed. The state of `a` after each iteration is a sorted list of integers.
- **`ntest`**: The variable `ntest` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`itest`**: After all iterations, `itest` will be equal to `ntest - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `ntest - 1`.

This output state reflects the final conditions of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
