Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, and `ans` is 'NO'. Additionally, `impossible` is True, meaning all pairs of consecutive sublists in `gr` have the same first elements and the same last elements.**
