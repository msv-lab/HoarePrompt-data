Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `res` is the new input string, `k` is the last index `i` for which the input was `<` if any input was `<`, otherwise `k` remains 1, and `best` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `res` is updated to the new input string received from the user.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `i`, `k`, `best`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
