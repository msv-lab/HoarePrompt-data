Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 1442.
   - `s` is a new user-provided string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".
   - `h` is the substring of `s` from index 0 to 1 (inclusive), which is `s[:2]`.
   - If `h` is '00' or `int(h) <= 12`, the condition holds true.
   - If `int(h) > 12`, the condition does not hold, but the values of `t`, `s`, and `h` remain unchanged.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `s[2:]` extracts the substring from index 2 to the end of the string `s`. This will give us the minutes part of the time string.
   - `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]` selects either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of `h`.
     - If `int(h) >= 12`, it returns 'PM'.
     - If `int(h) < 12`, it returns 'AM'.

4. **Conditions:**
   - If `h` is '00' or `int(h) <= 12`, the condition holds true, and the print statement will execute with the appropriate AM/PM.
   - If `int(h) > 12`, the condition does not hold, but the values remain unchanged, and the print statement will still execute with the appropriate AM/PM.

5. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output the minutes part of the time string followed by either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of `h`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:
- The minutes part of the time string (`s[2:]`).
- 'AM' if `int(h) < 12`.
- 'PM' if `int(h) >= 12`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **mm AM/PM (where mm is the minutes part of the time string `s` and AM/PM is determined by the value of `h`)**

For example, if `s` is "13:45":
- `h` is "13".
- `int(h) >= 12` is True.
- The output will be "45 PM".

If `s` is "09:20":
- `h` is "09".
- `int(h) < 12` is True.
- The output will be "20 AM".
