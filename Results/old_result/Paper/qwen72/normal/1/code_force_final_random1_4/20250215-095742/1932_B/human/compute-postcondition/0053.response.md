Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements where t must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` appended to it, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test` and must be at least 1, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and has `n` elements, `current_year` is now 0, `ai` is the first element of the list `a`, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `current_year` is not divisible by `ai`, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.**

Explanation:
- `next_year` is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
- Given `current_year` is 0 and `ai` is the first element of the list `a`, `current_year // ai` results in 0.
- Adding 1 to 0 gives 1.
- Multiplying 1 by `ai` gives `ai`.
- Therefore, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year` (which is 0).
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
