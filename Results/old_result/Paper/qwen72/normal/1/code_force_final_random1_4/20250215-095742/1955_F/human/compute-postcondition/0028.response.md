Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` is a list of four integers where 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers provided by user input, `cnt` is now `cnt + sum(math.floor(x / 2) for x in a)`**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `p_i` is a list of four integers each between 0 and 200, `a` is a list of integers provided by user input, and `cnt` is updated by adding the sum of the floor division of each element in `a` by 2.
- The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`.
- After executing this code, the value of `a` is updated to the list of integers provided by the user input.
- The values of `t` and `p_i` remain unchanged.
- The value of `cnt` is updated according to the given formula, which sums the floor division of each element in `a` by 2 and adds it to the current value of `cnt`.

Thus, the output state reflects these changes while keeping the initial conditions for `t` and `p_i` intact.
