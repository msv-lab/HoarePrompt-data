The code assigns the value of the element at index `k` of the list `a` to the variable `x`. Since `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element is unique and within the specified range, and `k` is a valid index within the bounds of the list, `x` will take the value of `a[k]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each element `a_i` is unique and within the range 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to `a[k]`.**
