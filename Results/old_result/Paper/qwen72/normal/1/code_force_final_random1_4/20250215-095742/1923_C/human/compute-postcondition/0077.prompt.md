Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is `m`, `m` is the second integer input, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`. The values of `t`, `n` (the first integer input), `p`, `c`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. `l` is a list of integers read from the input. `p` is now `[0]`, `c` is now `[0]`. `i` is 0, `j` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    if x == 1:
        j += 1
    i += x
    p.append(i)
    c.append(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is `m`, `m` is the second integer input, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1] + x`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`. The values of `t`, `n` (the first integer input), `p` is updated to include the new element `i`, `c` is updated to include the new element `j`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one element, `x` is the first element of `l`. If `x` is equal to 1, `j` is set to 1. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is `m`, `m` is the second integer input, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1] + 2*x`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`, `t` is unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `p` is updated to include the new element `i`, `c` is updated to include the new element `j`, `j` remains 0 if `x` is not 1, otherwise `j` is 2, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is `m`, `m` is the second integer input, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1] + 3*x`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`, `t` is unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `p` is updated to include the new element `i`, `c` is updated to include the new element `j`, `j` is incremented by 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` remains 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least three elements, `x` is the third element of `l`, `c` now includes the new element `j`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
