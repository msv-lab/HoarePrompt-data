To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains `i` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0.
3. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `j` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `b` is a list of strings from the input.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b`.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b` (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `l` is a list of integers from the input (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `suf` is a list containing one element `[0]` (not relevant to the loop head).

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n`**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
- **`i`**: The initial value of `i` should be 0, as it is the starting point of the range.

### Final State:
The final state should ensure that the loop can execute at least once. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing one element `[0]`, `i` is 0**
