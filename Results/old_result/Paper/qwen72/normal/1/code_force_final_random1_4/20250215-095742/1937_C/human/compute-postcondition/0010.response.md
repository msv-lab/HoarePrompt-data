Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is a placeholder (not used in the print statement).
   - `n` is greater than 3 (not used in the print statement).
   - `i` is 3.
   - `res` is an input string.
   - If `res` is `<`, then `k` is 2.
   - Otherwise, `k` remains 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `k`:**
   - The value of `k` depends on the value of `res`.
   - If `res` is `<`, then `k` is 2.
   - Otherwise, `k` is 1.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will always start with `?`.
   - The next value is `0`.
   - The value of `k` will be either 2 or 1 depending on the value of `res`.
   - The next value is `0`.
   - The value of `i` is 3.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `res` is `<`, the output will be: `? 0 2 0 3`.
   - Otherwise, the output will be: `? 0 1 0 3`.

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both cases:

- If `res` is `<`:
  Output: **? 0 2 0 3**

- Otherwise:
  Output: **? 0 1 0 3**

To provide a precise answer, we need to consider the most general case where the value of `res` is not specified:

Output: **? 0 [k] 0 3 (where [k] is 2 if res is "<", otherwise [k] is 1)**
