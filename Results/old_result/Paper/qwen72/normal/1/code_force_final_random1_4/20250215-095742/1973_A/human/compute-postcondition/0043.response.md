Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least three tuples.
- `p1` is the first element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `p2` is the second element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `p3` is the third element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
- If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` is a list containing one element, which is -1, and the program skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop.
- If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.
- Otherwise, the loop continues normally.
- `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
resultats.append(egalites // 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Check `total_points`**:
   - If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` is already set to contain `-1`, and the loop is skipped. This means the code snippet will not execute.
   - If `total_points` is even, the code snippet will execute.

2. **Check `total_matchs`**:
   - If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, the loop is skipped. This means the code snippet will not execute.
   - If `total_matchs` is 3 or less and `p3` is not greater than `total_matchs`, the code snippet will execute.

3. **Calculate `egalites`**:
   - `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.

4. **Append to `resultats`**:
   - The value `egalites // 2` is appended to the list `resultats`.

### Output State:
- If `total_points` is odd or `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, the code snippet does not execute, and the state remains unchanged.
- If `total_points` is even and `total_matchs` is 3 or less and `p3` is not greater than `total_matchs`, the value `egalites // 2` is appended to `resultats`.

### Final Output State:
- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least three tuples.
- `p1` is the first element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `p2` is the second element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `p3` is the third element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`.
- `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
- If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` is a list containing one element, which is -1.
- If `total_points` is even and `total_matchs` is 3 or less and `p3` is not greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is updated to include the value `egalites // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least three tuples. `p1` is the first element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. If `total_points` is odd, `resultats` is a list containing one element, which is -1. If `total_points` is even and `total_matchs` is 3 or less and `p3` is not greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is updated to include the value `egalites // 2`.**
