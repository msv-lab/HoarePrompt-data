Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - (n - 2) + 1`, `l` is the result of `func_3(3, l)`, and `c` is 3. If `k` is 0, the program returns the result of `func_3(3, l)`. If `k` is not 0 and `k < i - 1`, the program returns the result of `func_2(3, k, l)`. Otherwise, if `k` is not 0 and `k >= i - 1`, the program does not return anything explicitly.***
