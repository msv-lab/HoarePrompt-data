Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input and `len(a)` must be greater than 3, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input, `ad` is a list containing the integers 0, `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, and `a[3] - a[2]`, `bd` is a list containing only the integer 0, `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]` to the list `ad`. The rest of the variables and their values remain unchanged.
