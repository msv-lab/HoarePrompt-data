Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 1, `t` is the first integer from input, `v` is the second integer from input, `start` remains unchanged, `end` is updated to `v`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet updates the variable `end` to the value of `v`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `t`, `v`, and `start`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
