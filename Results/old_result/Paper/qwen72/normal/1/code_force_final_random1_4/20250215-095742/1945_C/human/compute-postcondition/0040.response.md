The code snippet `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is a placeholder
- `n` is an input integer greater than 3
- `s` is an input string
- `sl` is a list of characters from `s`
- If `n` is even, `pk` is set to `n / 2`
- If `n` is odd, `pk` is also set to `n / 2`
- `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `sl`
- `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in `sl`
- `mini` is 100,000,000
- `i` is 2
- If the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `zero` is 3, `one` is 0, and `zero_perc` is 75. Otherwise, `zero` is 0, `one` is 3, and `zero_perc` is 0.
- In both cases, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 3)`
- If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is a list containing `[1]`. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.

After executing the code snippet:
- `i` is 2
- `i + 1` is 3
- `lst` will be updated to include the value 3

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, if `n` is even, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, if `n` is odd, `pk` is also set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in `sl`, `mini` is 100,000,000, `i` is 2, if the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `zero` is 3, `one` is 0, and `zero_perc` is 75. Otherwise, `zero` is 0, `one` is 3, and `zero_perc` is 0. In both cases, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 3)`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is a list containing `[1, 3]`. Otherwise, `lst` is a list containing `[3]`.**
