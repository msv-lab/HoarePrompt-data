Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`), `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `a1` is `a // 2`, `a2` is `a // 2`.**

Explanation: The values of `a1` and `a2` are both set to the integer division of `a` by 2. The other variables (`t` and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
