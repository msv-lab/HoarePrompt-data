Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, and the loop counter `_` remains 0. If `i + 1 < n` and the character at index `i` in `a` is '<', and the character at index `i + 1` in `b` is '<', or if the character at index `i` in `a` is '<' and the character at index `i - 1` in `b` is '<', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the loop continues.***
