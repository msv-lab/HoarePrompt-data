To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given State:
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100
- `i` is `n-1`
- `t` and `v` are the last input integers read in the loop
- `num` contains all the integers `v` that were input with `t` == 3 during the loop's execution
- `start` is the highest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 1, or it remains -1 if no such `v` was greater than -1
- `end` is the lowest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 2, or it remains 1000000000.0 if no such `v` was less than 1000000000.0
- `count_num` is 0

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in num:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements in the list `num`.
- For the loop to execute, `num` must contain at least one element.
- The variable `i` in the loop head is a loop variable that takes on the values of the elements in `num`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is `num`.
- To ensure the loop executes, `num` must contain at least one element.

### Final State:
Since the loop will execute if `num` contains at least one element, we need to ensure that `num` is not empty. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `t`, `v`, `start`, `end`, `count_num`) do not directly affect the loop's execution based on the loop head.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is `n-1`, `t` and `v` are the last input integers read in the loop, `num` must contain at least one element, `start` is the highest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 1, or it remains -1 if no such `v` was greater than -1, `end` is the lowest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 2, or it remains 1000000000.0 if no such `v` was less than 1000000000.0, `count_num` is 0**
