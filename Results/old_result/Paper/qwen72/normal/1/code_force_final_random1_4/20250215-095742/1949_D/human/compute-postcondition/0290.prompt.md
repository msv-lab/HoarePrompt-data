Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is `n + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `nx` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sb[:n // 4] or j in sb[:n // 4]:
        nx += 'S'
    else:
        nx += 'F'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 1, `i` is `n + 1`. If the character at position `j - 1` (which is 0) in the string `xx[i]` is not a question mark ('?'), then `nx` is set to the character at position 0 in the string `xx[n + 1]`. Otherwise, if the character at position `i` in `xx` and index `j - 1` is `?`, and if `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2, and `i` is `n + 1`. If `xx[n + 1][1]` is not '?', `nx` is `initial_nx + xx[n + 1][1]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, an error occurs due to `nx` being undefined. Otherwise, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus `'F'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`j` is 3. If `xx[i][2]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is updated to `nx` + `xx[i][2]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, `nx` is updated to include one additional 'S'. If neither of these conditions is met, `nx` is incremented by the character 'F'. The variables `n`, `i`, `xx`, and `sb` remain unchanged, and the condition for the loop to execute again is that `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
