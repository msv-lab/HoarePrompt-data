The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the iterable `b_values`. The loop can execute again if there are more elements in `b_values` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the next element in `b_values`, and `b_values` must be a non-empty iterable. For the loop to execute one more time, `b_values` must still have at least one more element left to iterate over, and `i` will be set to this next element.

State: **`i` is the next element in `b_values`, `n` is greater than `m`, `b_values` must be an iterable with at least one more element, `cnt_b[i]` is `0`**
