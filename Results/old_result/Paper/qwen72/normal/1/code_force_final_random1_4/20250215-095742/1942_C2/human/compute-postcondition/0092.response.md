To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, len(a)):
```

Here, the loop will execute if the range `range(1, len(a))` is non-empty. This means that `len(a)` must be greater than 1. Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will be set by the `range` function, starting from 1 and going up to `len(a) - 1`. We don't need to adjust `i` explicitly, as it will be managed by the loop.

2. **`a`**: The list `a` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute. Therefore, `len(a)` must be greater than 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the first input integer
- `x` is the second input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)
- `y` is the third input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x
- `tt` must be greater than 1
- `ii` is 2
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`
- `ans` is `x + y - 2`
- `tmp` is an empty list
- The new value of `a` is a list of integers read from the input

We need to ensure that `a` has at least 2 elements for the loop to execute. Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect this requirement.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is the third input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list**
