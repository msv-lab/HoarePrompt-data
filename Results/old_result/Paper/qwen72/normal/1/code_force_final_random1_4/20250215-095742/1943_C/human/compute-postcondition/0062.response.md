The code appends the tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 3 and `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, the new tuple being appended is `(c2, 3)`. The list `ops` initially contains the tuples `(c2 - 1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, and `(c2 - 1, 3)`. After appending `(c2, 3)`, the updated list `ops` will be:

- `(c2 - 1, 1)`
- `(c2, 1)`
- `(c2 - 1, 3)`
- `(c2, 3)`

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path_ba` is a list with a length of at least 4, `i` is 3, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `n` is `-1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c2 - 1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c2 - 1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`, and the variables `_`, `u`, `v`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values.**
