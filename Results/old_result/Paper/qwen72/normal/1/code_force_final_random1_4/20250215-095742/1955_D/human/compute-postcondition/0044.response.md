Postcondition: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `b` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`. The element `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose count in `cnt_b` is non-negative after the loop has completed minus 1. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, `ans` remains 0.**
