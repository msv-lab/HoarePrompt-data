Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `k - 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has been reset to 0, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to be reset to 0, `cur` is 0 or a bitmask representing the characters seen so far in the current sequence, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the bit position where `cur & 1 << i` is 0 (if any), otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string, and `cnt` is less than `n`.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: After all iterations, `i` will be `k - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `k - 1`.
- **`tmp`**: The value of `tmp` depends on whether `cur & 1 << i` is 0 for any `i` in the range `[0, k-1]`. If it is 0 for any `i`, `tmp` will be the character corresponding to that bit position (e.g., 'a' for `i = 0`, 'b' for `i = 1`, etc.). If no such `i` exists, `tmp` remains an empty string.
- **Other Variables**: All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, `cur`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
