Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is `n-1`, `t` and `v` are the last input integers read in the loop, `num` contains all the integers `v` that were input with `t` == 3 during the loop's execution, `start` is the highest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 1, or it remains -1 if no such `v` was greater than -1, `end` is the lowest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 2, or it remains 1000000000.0 if no such `v` was less than 1000000000.0, `count_num` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in num:
    if i < start or i > end:
        continue
    else:
        count_num += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is `n-1`, `t` and `v` are the last input integers read in the loop, `num` must contain at least one element, `start` is the highest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 1, or it remains -1 if no such `v` was greater than -1, `end` is the lowest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 2, or it remains 1000000000.0 if no such `v` was less than 1000000000.0. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, `count_num` remains 0. Otherwise, if `i` is between `start` and `end` inclusive, `count_num` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is the next element in `num`, `t` and `v` are the last input integers read in the loop, `num` must contain at least one element, `start` is the highest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 1, or it remains -1 if no such `v` was greater than -1, `end` is the lowest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 2, or it remains 1000000000.0 if no such `v` was less than 1000000000.0, and `count_num` is either unchanged (if `i` is outside the range defined by `start` and `end`) or increased by 1 (if `i` is within the range defined by `start` and `end`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is the next element in `num`, `t` and `v` are the last input integers read in the loop, `num` must contain at least one element, `start` is the highest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 1, or it remains -1 if no such `v` was greater than -1, `end` is the lowest value of `v` encountered when `t` == 2, or it remains 1000000000.0 if no such `v` was less than 1000000000.0, and `count_num` is either unchanged if `i` is outside the range defined by `start` and `end`, or increased by 1 if `i` is within the range defined by `start` and `end`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
