Initial State: 
- `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the computation.
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is equal to `t`.
- `s` is an input string.
- `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`.
- `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.

Code Snippet:
```python
print(x + y)
```

Explanation:
- The variable `x` counts the occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`.
- The variable `y` counts the occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`.
- The `print(x + y)` statement will print the sum of these two counts.

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `x` and `y`. However, the output will be the sum of the number of times 'map' and 'pie' appear in the string `s`.

Output: **x + y (where x is the number of times 'map' appears in s and y is the number of times 'pie' appears in s)**
