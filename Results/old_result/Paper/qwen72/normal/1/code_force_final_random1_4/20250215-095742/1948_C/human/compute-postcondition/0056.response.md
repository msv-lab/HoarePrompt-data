The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but is expected to handle input in the form of multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and two strings of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. These strings represent the directions of arrows in the first and second rows of a grid. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. The exact nature of the return value is not specified in the given information, but it is implied that the function will return some form of output for each test case, likely related to the configuration of the arrows.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` with characters '<' and '>'. It returns a result for each test case, based on the configuration of the arrows in the grid.**
