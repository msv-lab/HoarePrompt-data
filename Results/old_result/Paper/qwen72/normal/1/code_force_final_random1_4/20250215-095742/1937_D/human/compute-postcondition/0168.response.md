Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is assigned the value at index `l` of the list `A`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, and `b` is assigned the value at index `r - 1` of the list `B`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is updated to `b - (idx_B[r - (l + 2)] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (r - (l + 2) + 1)`.***
