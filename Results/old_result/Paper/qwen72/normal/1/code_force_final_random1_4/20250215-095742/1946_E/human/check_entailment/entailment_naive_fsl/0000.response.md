Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly address the problem described. The problem requires counting the number of permutations that match the given prefix and suffix maximums, but the provided functions seem to be related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and modular arithmetic, which are not relevant to solving the permutation counting problem.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2 3
1 2
2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

The expected output is 3 because there are three permutations that satisfy the conditions:
- [1, 4, 3, 2]
- [2, 4, 3, 1]
- [3, 4, 2, 1]

However, the provided functions do not compute this result. They are not designed to handle the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
