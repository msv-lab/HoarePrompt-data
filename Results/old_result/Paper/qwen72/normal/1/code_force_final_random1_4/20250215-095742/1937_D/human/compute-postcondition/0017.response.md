Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `idx_A` remains unchanged from the previous iteration. If `len(idx_A) == 0`, `A` is updated to include an additional element `0` at the end. Otherwise, `A` is updated with `x` appended to it, and the values of `s`, `n`, `i`, and `idx_A` remain unchanged.***
