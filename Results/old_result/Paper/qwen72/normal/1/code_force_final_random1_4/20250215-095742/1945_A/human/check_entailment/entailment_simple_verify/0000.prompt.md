You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())
        b += c
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        a, b, c = map(int, s.split())
        
        b += c
        
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
        
    #State: After all iterations, `a` is the last integer obtained from splitting and converting the string `s`, `b` is the sum of the original value of `b` and all the values of `c` encountered during the iterations, and `c` is the last integer obtained from splitting and converting the string `s`. The loop iterates over each line from the second line onward of the standard input, and the file must have at least as many lines as the number of iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of tents required is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The line `b += c` assumes that all universals can be used to satisfy the extroverts' requirement. However, this is not always the case. Universals can also be used to satisfy the introverts' requirement or to form tents with other universals.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is not clear and does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem description. For example, it does not properly account for the cases where universals are used to form tents with introverts or other universals.

3. **Edge Case**: Consider the input `1 2 1`. According to the problem description:
   - 1 introvert needs 1 tent.
   - 2 extroverts need 1 tent with 3 people, but there is only 1 universal available.
   - The program should output `-1` because it is impossible to satisfy the extroverts' requirement with the available universals. However, the program does not handle this case correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and thus it is incorrect.
