### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q` which represent the final destination, the number of known points, and the number of queries, respectively.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b` which contain the positions and times of the known points, respectively.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - The program initializes `a` and `b` with an extra 0 at the beginning to handle the starting point (0, 0). This is correct because it ensures that the first segment starts from 0.
   - It calculates the differences `ad` and `bd` which represent the distances and time intervals between consecutive known points. This is done correctly by iterating through the lists and computing the differences.
   - It calculates the speeds `v` for each segment between known points. However, the speed calculation is unnecessary for the final solution, as the time calculation can be done directly using the differences `ad` and `bd`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it uses `bisect_left` to find the segment where the query point `ql` lies. This is an efficient way to find the correct segment.
   - If the query point `ql` exactly matches a known point, it directly prints the corresponding time. This is correct.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the time taken to reach `ql` by adding the time to reach the previous known point and the time to travel the remaining distance in the current segment. The formula used is `m += b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * ql / ad[s])`. This is correct, but the division should be done carefully to ensure the result is an integer when rounded down.

4. **Time Calculation:**
   - The time calculation is done by adding the time to reach the previous known point (`b[s-1]`) and the time to travel the remaining distance (`bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`). The division should be done using floating-point arithmetic to ensure accuracy before converting to an integer.
   - The final result is printed using `print(int(m), end=' ')`, which correctly rounds down the result to the nearest integer.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated time for each query, rounded down to the nearest integer. This is correct.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements and constraints. It efficiently finds the segment for each query and calculates the time using the precomputed differences and speeds. The use of `bisect_left` ensures that the segment search is efficient, and the time calculation is accurate.

However, there is a minor issue in the speed calculation step, which is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program. Despite this, the core logic and the final output are correct.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: **True**
