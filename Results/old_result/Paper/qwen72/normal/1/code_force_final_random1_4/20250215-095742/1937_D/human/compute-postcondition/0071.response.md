Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the first character of `s` is '>', `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 0) * (l + 1)` which simplifies to `idx_B[r - 1] * (l + 1)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
- Since `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `idx_B[r - 1] * (l + 1)`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `s`, `l`, `r`, `a`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
