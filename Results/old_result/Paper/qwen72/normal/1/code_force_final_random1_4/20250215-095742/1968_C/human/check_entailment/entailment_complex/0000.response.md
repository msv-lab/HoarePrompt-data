Reasoning:  
The program aims to generate an array `a` that satisfies the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \). Let's break down the logic and verify if it meets the requirements:

1. **Initialization**: The first element of `a` is set to 1000. This is a valid choice because \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \).

2. **Generating Subsequent Elements**:
   - For each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \), the program sets \( a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1] \).
   - This ensures that \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i \) because:
     - \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \)
     - When you take \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \), it simplifies to \( (a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}) \bmod a_{i-1} \), which is \( x_{i-1} \).

3. **Constraints**:
   - The values of \( a_i \) are within the range \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) because the initial value is 1000 and each subsequent value is incremented by at most 500 (since \( 1 \le x_i \le 500 \)).

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the list `a` for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly generate the required array `a` for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
