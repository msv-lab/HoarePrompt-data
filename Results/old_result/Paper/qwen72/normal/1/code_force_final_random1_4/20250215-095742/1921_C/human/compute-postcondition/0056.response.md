The code snippet provided reinitializes `array2` to an empty list. This action overrides the initial state of `array2`, which previously contained specific elements based on the conditions given. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array2` is an empty list, `i` is `n`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the new input, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.**
