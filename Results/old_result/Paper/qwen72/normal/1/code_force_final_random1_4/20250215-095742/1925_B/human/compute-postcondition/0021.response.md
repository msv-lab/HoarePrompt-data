Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is at least 1, `n` is updated to the values provided by the user input (with \(1 \leq n \leq x\)), `q` is 0, `i` is 3, and `i` must be less than or equal to \( \text{int}(\sqrt{x}) + 1 \). `ans` is set to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the result of `x // i`.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `q`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` does not affect the current code snippet, so it is not considered in the output state.
