Postcondition: ***`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `m` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `k` is a new input integer ≥ 2, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, `b` is a new list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2. If `i` (which is 2) is in both `a` and `b`, then: if `aOnes` < `bOnes`, `aOnes` is 1 or 2 and `bOnes` is 0 or 1; otherwise, `aOnes` is 0 or 1 and `bOnes` is 1 or 2. If `i` (which is 2) is in `a` but not in `b`, and `aOnes` ≤ `newk`, then `aOnes` is 1 or 2 and `bOnes` is 0 or 1; otherwise, `aOnes` remains 0 or 1 and `bOnes` is 0, 1, or 2. If `i` (which is 2) is in `b` but not in `a`, and `bOnes` ≤ `newk`, then `bOnes` is 1 or 2; otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0 or 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
