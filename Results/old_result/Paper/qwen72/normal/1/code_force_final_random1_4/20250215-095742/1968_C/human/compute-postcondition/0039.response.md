Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is a positive integer (at least 1).
- `x` is a list of integers derived from user input.
- `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `a[0]` set to 1000.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*a)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `a`:**
   - `a` is a list of length `n` initially filled with zeros.
   - `a[0]` is explicitly set to 1000.

2. **Filling the List `a`:**
   - For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is calculated as `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.
   - This means each subsequent element in `a` is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`.

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `n = 4` and `x = [10, 20, 30]`.
   - `a` is initialized as `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.
   - `a[0]` is set to 1000.
   - `a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 1000 + 10 = 1010`.
   - `a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = 1010 + 20 = 1030`.
   - `a[3] = a[2] + x[2] = 1030 + 30 = 1060`.
   - Therefore, `a` becomes `[1000, 1010, 1030, 1060]`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(*a)` statement will unpack the list `a` and print its elements separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces. The exact values depend on the user input for `x`, but the structure is clear.

Output: **1000, 1000 + x[0], 1000 + x[0] + x[1], ..., 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]** (where `x` is the list of integers derived from user input).
