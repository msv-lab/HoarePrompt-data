The code snippet `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the value at the index `b[i]` in the list `cnt_b` by 1. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `_` remains a placeholder.
- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains an integer.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `k` remains an integer.
- `a` remains a list of integers from user input.
- `b` remains a list of integers from user input.
- `i` is 0, so `b[i]` refers to the first element of the list `b`.
- `cnt_b` is assumed to be a list where each index corresponds to a count. The value at the index `b[0]` in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `b` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is 0, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1.**
