The only objects in the loop head are the variables `itest`, `ntest`, and the range parameters (0, ntest, 1). To ensure the loop executes, `ntest` must be greater than 0. The variable `itest` should start at 0, as specified in the range.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `ntest` is assigned the value of an input integer.

To ensure the loop executes:
- `ntest` must be greater than 0.
- `itest` should start at 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ntest` must be greater than 0, `itest` is 0**
