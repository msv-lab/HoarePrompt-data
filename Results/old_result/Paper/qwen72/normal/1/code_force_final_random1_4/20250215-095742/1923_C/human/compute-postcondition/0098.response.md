To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `m` is greater than 1.
   - `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the given code).
   - `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input.
   - `i` is defined as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
   - `s` is defined as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

2. **Condition:**
   - The condition checks if `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and if `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`.
   - If both conditions are true, the code will execute the `print('YES')` statement.
   - If either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1, or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`, the condition does not hold true, but the code still prints 'YES'.

Given the condition, the `print('YES')` statement will always be executed regardless of whether the condition is true or false. This is because the code does not include any conditional logic to prevent the print statement from executing.

Therefore, the output will always be:

Output: **YES**
