Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the input integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d1[2]` is 1, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user. If `y` > `x`, the condition `y > x` holds true. If `y` ≤ `x`, the condition `y` ≤ `x` holds true. `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0.**
