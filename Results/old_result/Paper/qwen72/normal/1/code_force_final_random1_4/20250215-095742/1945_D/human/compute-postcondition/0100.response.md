The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `custo_pra_trocar_a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000
- `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9
- `cases` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0
- `c` is 2
- `na_frente` is the first integer provided by the user
- `pos_final` is the second integer provided by the user
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers provided by the user
- `total` is the sum of the smaller values between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` to 0
- `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each `v` that is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If no such `v` exists, `best` remains 10^12

After executing the code snippet:
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` is now a list of integers provided by the user, replacing its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer provided by the user, `pos_final` is the second integer provided by the user, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `total` is the sum of the smaller values between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` to 0, and `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each `v` that is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If no such `v` exists, `best` remains 10^12.**
