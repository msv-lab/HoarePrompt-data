Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is equal to `t`, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.** 

The code snippet `y = s.count('pie')` calculates the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
