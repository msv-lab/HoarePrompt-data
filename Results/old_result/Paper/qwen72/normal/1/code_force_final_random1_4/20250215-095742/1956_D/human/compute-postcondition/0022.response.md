Functionality: ** The function `recursive_maximize_sum` takes two integer parameters `l` and `r` such that `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`, where `a` is a list of integers. It modifies the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` in such a way that if the sum of the elements in this sublist is less than or equal to the square of its length, all elements in the sublist are set to the length of the sublist, and the tuple `(l, r)` is appended to the list `ops`. If the sum is greater, the function recursively processes the left and right sublists around the maximum element in the current sublist. The function does not return a value but modifies the list `a` and the list `ops`. After the function concludes, the list `a` will have been modified according to the rules described, and the list `ops` will contain tuples representing the ranges that were processed. **
