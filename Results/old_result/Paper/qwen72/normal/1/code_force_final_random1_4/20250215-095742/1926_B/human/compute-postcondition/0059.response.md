Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, the grid is represented by n lines of n characters, where each character is either '0' or '1', the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1, `a` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `b` is the last input string provided by the user. `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in each input string `b` that contained at least one '1' during all iterations of the loop.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the specified range.
- The variable `n` remains an integer within the specified range.
- The grid representation and its properties remain unchanged.
- The variable `a` remains greater than 2.
- The variable `i` remains 2.
- The variable `b` is updated to the last input string provided by the user.
- The list `k` contains the count of '1's in each input string `b` that contained at least one '1' during all iterations of the loop. If no input strings contained '1', `k` will remain an empty list.
