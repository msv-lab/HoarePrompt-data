You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that b <= a.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the tuple (1, 0)
    #State: a and b are non-negative integers such that b <= a, and b is not equal to 0
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns the values of `d` and `c`, which are the results of `func_1(b, a)`. Since `b` is a non-negative integer and `b <= a`, but the current value of `a` is less than the current value of `b`, this implies that `a` and `b` have swapped values or `a` has been updated to a value less than `b` before calling `func_1`. The exact values of `c` and `d` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, but they are the outputs of `func_1` when called with `b` and `a` as arguments.
    #State: a and b are non-negative integers such that b <= a, and b is not equal to 0, and a is greater than or equal to b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns a tuple (1, -((a // b) - 1)), where `a` is a non-negative integer divisible by `b` with no remainder, and `b` is a non-negative integer not equal to 0 and less than or equal to `a`. The first element of the tuple is 1, and the second element is the negative of the quotient of `a` divided by `b` minus 1.
    #State: a and b are non-negative integers such that b <= a, b is not equal to 0, a is greater than or equal to b, and a is not divisible by b
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns a tuple `(d, c - a // b * d)` where `d` and `c` are the results of the function call `func_1(b, a % b)`. Here, `d` is the second result from `func_1`, and the second value in the tuple is calculated by subtracting the product of `a` divided by `b` (integer division) and `d` from `c`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are non-negative integers with the constraint that `b` is less than or equal to `a`. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the tuple (1, 0)

Case_2: The program returns the values of `d` and `c`, which are the results of `func_1(b, a)`. Since `b` is a non-negative integer and `b <= a`, but the current value of `a` is less than the current value of `b`, this implies that `a` and `b` have swapped values or `a` has been updated to a value less than `b` before calling `func_1`. The exact values of `c` and `d` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, but they are the outputs of `func_1` when called with `b` and `a` as arguments.

Case_3: The program returns a tuple (1, -((a // b) - 1)), where `a` is a non-negative integer divisible by `b` with no remainder, and `b` is a non-negative integer not equal to 0 and less than or equal to `a`. The first element of the tuple is 1, and the second element is the negative of the quotient of `a` divided by `b` minus 1.

Case_4: The program returns a tuple `(d, c - a // b * d)` where `d` and `c` are the results of the function call `func_1(b, a % b)`. Here, `d` is the second result from `func_1`, and the second value in the tuple is calculated by subtracting the product of `a` divided by `b` (integer division) and `d` from `c`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
