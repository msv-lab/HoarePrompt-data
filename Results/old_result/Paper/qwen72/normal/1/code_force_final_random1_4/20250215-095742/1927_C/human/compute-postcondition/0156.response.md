Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers â‰¥ 1, `t` is `t + 2`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 3. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
