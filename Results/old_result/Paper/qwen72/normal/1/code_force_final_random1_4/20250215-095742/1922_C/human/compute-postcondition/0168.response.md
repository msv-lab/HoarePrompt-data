Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` is `t`, which is the total number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is the input integer representing the number of cities, `l` is the list of distances between cities, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 2 to `n` inclusive, storing the minimum distance to the next city from the left, and `d2` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 1 to `n-1` inclusive, storing the minimum distance to the next city from the right. `m` is the input integer representing the number of queries, and for each query, `x` and `y` are the indices of the cities provided by the user. The values of `d1` and `d2` are updated based on the conditions specified in the loop, and the results of the queries are printed accordingly.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The variable `i` will have reached the value of `t`, meaning all test cases have been processed.
- For each test case, the variables `n`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, and `m` will have been updated according to the logic inside the loop.
- The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` will contain the computed distances for each city as described in the loop.
- The results of the queries will have been printed for each test case.
