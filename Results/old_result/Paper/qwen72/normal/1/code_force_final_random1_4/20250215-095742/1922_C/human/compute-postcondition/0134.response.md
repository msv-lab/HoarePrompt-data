To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `range(n - 2, 0, -1)`.
   - The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from `n - 2` down to `1` (inclusive), with a step of `-1`.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value of the range (`n - 2`) must be greater than or equal to the stopping value (`1`).
   - This means `n - 2 >= 1`, which simplifies to `n >= 3`.

3. **Initial State Adjustments:**
   - The initial state given is `i` is `n-2`.
   - Since `i` is already set to `n-2`, we don't need to adjust `i` itself.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 for the loop to execute.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - The other variables (`l`, `m`, `d1`, `d2`, `x`, `y`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

### Final State Adjustment:
- The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is at least 3.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the input integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d1[2]` is 1, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, and `d2[n-1]` is 1.**
