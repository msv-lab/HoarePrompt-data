Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `int(n / 3)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
