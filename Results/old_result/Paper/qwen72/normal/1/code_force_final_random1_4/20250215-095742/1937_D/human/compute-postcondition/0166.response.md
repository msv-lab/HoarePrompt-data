The value of `b` is updated by subtracting the value at index `x` from the current value of `b`. The value of `x` is calculated as `r - (l + 2)`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is assigned the value at index `l` of the list `A`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is now `b - B[r - (l + 2)]`.**
