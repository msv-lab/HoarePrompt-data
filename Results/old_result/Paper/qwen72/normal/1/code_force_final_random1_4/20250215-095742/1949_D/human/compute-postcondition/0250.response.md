Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 1. If `xx[i][0]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][0]`. If `xx[i][0]` is '?', and either `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, `nx` is updated to include the character 'S' appended to its previous value. Otherwise, `nx` is updated to the original value of `nx` plus the character 'F'.***
