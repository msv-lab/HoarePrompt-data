The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the formula `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. Given the initial state, we can calculate the new value of `dp[i]`:

- `i` is 3
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ \text{dp}[3] = (\text{dp}[2] + 2 \times (3 - 1) \times \text{dp}[1]) \mod 1000000007 \]

\[ \text{dp}[3] = (3 + 2 \times 2 \times 1) \mod 1000000007 \]

\[ \text{dp}[3] = (3 + 4) \mod 1000000007 \]

\[ \text{dp}[3] = 7 \mod 1000000007 \]

\[ \text{dp}[3] = 7 \]

Therefore, the updated value of `dp[3]` is 7. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 3, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7**
