You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: n is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, u2vs is a list of lists where each sublist represents the neighbors of a vertex in the tree.
```
def func_2():
```
Output: The program returns `None`. The final state of `path_ba` will be a list containing the sequence of predecessors starting from `b` and ending with the first vertex that has no predecessor (indicated by `-1`). The variable `n` will be `-1`, indicating the end of the path. The variables `_`, `u`, `v`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `i` is `ci`, and `ops` contains the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `path_ba` is a list with a length of at least 9, `i` is the last valid index in the range, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `n` is `-1`, and `ops` is a list containing tuples for each valid `i` in the range, specifically `(c2 - 1, i)` and `(c2, i)`.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
In your response strictly use the format: Functionality: **the functionality you calculate.**, and describe this functionality in Natural language easily understandable by humans
