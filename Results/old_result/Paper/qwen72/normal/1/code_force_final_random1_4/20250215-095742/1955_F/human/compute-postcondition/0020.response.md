Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` is a list of four integers where 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers provided by user input that must have at least one element, `x` is the first element in `a`, `cnt` is now `cnt + math.floor(x / 2)`**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is updated by adding the floor division result of `x` divided by 2 to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `cnt` is `cnt + math.floor(x / 2)`.
