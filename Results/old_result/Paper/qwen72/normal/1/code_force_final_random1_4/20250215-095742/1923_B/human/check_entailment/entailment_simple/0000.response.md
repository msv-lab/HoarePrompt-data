### Reasoning:

1. **Functionality and Logic:**
   - The program correctly models the game scenario where the player fires bullets at monsters to reduce their health and prevent them from reaching the player.
   - The `func_1` function processes each test case by sorting the monsters based on their distance from the player and then simulating the firing of bullets each second.
   - The `func_2` function reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the result.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The input is read correctly, and the constraints are respected.
   - The number of test cases `t` is within the specified range.
   - The values of `n` and `k` are within their respective ranges.
   - The lists `a` and `x` are correctly parsed and used in the function.

3. **Algorithm Correctness:**
   - The algorithm sorts the monsters by their distance from the player, ensuring that the closest monsters are targeted first.
   - The inner loop reduces the health of the monsters until either all bullets are fired or all monsters in the current distance range are defeated.
   - The outer loop increments the distance and continues until all monsters are processed or a monster reaches the player.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the number of bullets `k` is very high or very low.
   - It correctly identifies scenarios where the player can or cannot defeat all monsters before any of them reach the player.

5. **Output:**
   - The output is correctly formatted as "YES" or "NO" for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the game scenario as described. It handles all specified constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
