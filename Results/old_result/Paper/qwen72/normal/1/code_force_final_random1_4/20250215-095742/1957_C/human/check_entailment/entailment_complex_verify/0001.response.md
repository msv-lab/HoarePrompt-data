Reasoning:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The initialization of the `dp` array with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` is correct. These values represent the number of ways to place rooks on a 1x1 and 2x2 board, respectively, without any rooks attacking each other.

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**: The transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is also correct. This formula accounts for:
   - Placing a rook in the first row or column, which leaves an (i-1) x (i-1) subproblem.
   - Placing a rook in the first row and a rook in the first column (but not in the same cell), which leaves an (i-2) x (i-2) subproblem, and there are 2 * (i-1) ways to do this.

3. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.

4. **Invalid Positions**: The set `invalid` is used to keep track of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks. This is done by adding the row and column indices of each move to the set. This approach ensures that the positions where rooks are already placed are not considered for further placements.

5. **Final Configuration Calculation**: The program calculates the number of possible final configurations by subtracting the number of invalid rows and columns from `n` and looking up the result in the `dp` array. The use of `max(1, ...)` ensures that the result is at least 1, which is necessary because even if all rows and columns are invalid, there is still one configuration (no rooks placed).

6. **Modulo Operation**: The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers, which is consistent with the problem statement.

However, there is a subtle issue in the program that needs to be addressed:

- **Mirroring Moves**: The problem states that the computer mirrors the player's move by placing a black rook at position (c, r) when the player places a white rook at (r, c). If r = c, the computer skips its turn. The current implementation does not account for this mirroring behavior explicitly. Instead, it simply marks both r and c as invalid, which might not accurately reflect the game's rules, especially when r = c.

Despite this, the program still works correctly for the given problem constraints because the mirroring behavior is implicitly handled by marking both r and c as invalid, which effectively prevents further rooks from being placed in those rows and columns. The dynamic programming approach ensures that the number of valid configurations is calculated correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, even though it does not explicitly handle the mirroring behavior.

Final: **True**
