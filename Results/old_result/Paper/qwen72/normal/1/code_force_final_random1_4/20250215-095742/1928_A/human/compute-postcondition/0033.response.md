Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. The variable `i` will be equal to `t - 1`. For each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` were read from the input, and based on the conditions in the loop, the program printed 'yes' or 'no' accordingly. After the loop completes, the final values of `a` and `b` will be the ones from the last iteration, but these values are not retained for further use outside the loop.**

This means that after the loop finishes executing, the loop counter `i` will have reached the value `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times. The values of `a` and `b` will be the ones from the last iteration, but since the loop does not modify `a` and `b` beyond reading them from input, their final values are not significant outside the context of the loop. The primary output of the loop is the series of 'yes' or 'no' prints based on the conditions checked within the loop.
