Reasoning:

The program aims to determine whether it's possible to construct a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move consists of adding or removing a single cube. The logic implemented in the program checks several conditions to decide if the desired state can be achieved:

1. If `n` equals `m`, it means that all moves were used to add cubes, which is straightforward.
2. If `m` is greater than `n`, it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves, so the answer is 'No'.
3. If `m` is `n - 1`, it implies that one move was used to remove a cube, and the rest were used to add cubes, which is possible.
4. If both `n` and `m` are even or both are odd, it suggests that the parity of the number of moves matches the parity of the final number of cubes, which is necessary for the construction to be possible because each move changes the parity of the number of cubes.

However, there is a logical flaw in the condition checking. The current implementation does not correctly handle all scenarios where the difference between `n` and `m` is even. Specifically, the condition `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:` and `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:` are not sufficient to cover all valid cases where the difference between `n` and `m` is even. A simpler and more accurate condition would be to check if the absolute difference between `n` and `m` is even, which ensures that the parity of the number of moves and the final number of cubes aligns correctly.

A corrected version of the relevant part of the code would be:
```python
if abs(n - m) % 2 == 0:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```

Given the current implementation, it fails to correctly identify some valid cases where the difference between `n` and `m` is even but the parities do not match the specific conditions checked.

Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
