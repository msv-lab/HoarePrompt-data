The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `infoA` and `infoB`, which are objects containing attributes `balance` and `position`. The function returns the difference between the `balance` attributes of `infoA` and `infoB` if their balances are not equal. If the balances are equal, it returns the difference between the `position` attributes of `infoB` and `infoA`. In both cases, the function does not modify the input objects and only computes and returns a numerical difference based on the conditions described.
