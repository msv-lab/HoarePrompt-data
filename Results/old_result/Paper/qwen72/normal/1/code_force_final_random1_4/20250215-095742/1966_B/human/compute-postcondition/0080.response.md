The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 (since `i` must be less than `n - 1`).

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, `i` is 2, `j` is `m-2`, the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, `impossible` is set to False if `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, and `ans` is 'NO'.**
