You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, representing the number of moves already played. The function `func_1` should actually take more parameters to fully represent the problem, including the moves already played. However, based on the provided function definition, only `n` is given.
def func_1(n):
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
        
    #State: `n` must be at least `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, `dp[5]` is 81, and so on up to `dp[n]` which is the value computed by the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The function `func_1` initializes the dynamic programming array `dp` with base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. This is correct because for a 1x1 board, there is only one way to place a rook, and for a 2x2 board, there are three ways to place rooks without them attacking each other (one in each cell).

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**: The transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is used to compute the number of ways to place rooks on an i x i board. This formula is derived from the fact that:
   - Placing a rook in the first row or column leaves an (i-1) x (i-1) subproblem.
   - Placing a rook in the first row and a rook in the first column (but not in the same cell) leaves an (i-2) x (i-2) subproblem, and there are 2 * (i-1) ways to do this (choosing one of the (i-1) cells in the first row and one of the (i-1) cells in the first column).

3. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.

4. **Invalid Positions**: The set `invalid` is used to keep track of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks. This is done by adding the row and column indices of each move to the set.

5. **Final Configuration Calculation**: The program calculates the number of possible final configurations by subtracting the number of invalid rows and columns from `n` and looking up the result in the `dp` array. The `max(1, ...)` ensures that the result is at least 1, which is necessary because even if all rows and columns are invalid, there is still one configuration (no rooks placed).

6. **Modulo Operation**: The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
