Let's analyze the initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `1`
- `n` is greater than or equal to `2`
- `l` is a list of integers
- `m` must be greater than `1`
- `d1` is `0`
- `j` is `1`
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user
- If `y` > `x`, the condition `y > x` holds true
- If `y` ≤ `x`, the condition `y` ≤ `x` holds true

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `d1`**: According to the initial state, `d1` is `0`. This means `d1` is a single integer value, not a list or dictionary.
2. **Indexing `d1`**: The code attempts to access `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`. Since `d1` is a single integer (`0`), it cannot be indexed. Indexing an integer will result in a `TypeError`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `d1` is a single integer and not a list or dictionary, attempting to index it with `y` and `x` will raise a `TypeError`.

Output: **TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable**
