Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer provided by the user minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `total` is 0, `best` is 10^12, `v` starts at `na_frente`, and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**
