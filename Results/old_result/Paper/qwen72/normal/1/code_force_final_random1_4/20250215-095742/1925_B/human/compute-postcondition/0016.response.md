Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is updated to the values provided by the user input (with 1 <= n <= x), `q` is 0, `i` is 2, and `i` must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1. If `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)`, then `ans` is set to the maximum of its previous value and `x // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
