Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 2 to `n` inclusive, where each key `k` has a value determined by the loop conditions, and `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0.**

### Explanation:
- **`i` is `n-2`:** The loop iterates from `1` to `n-2` (inclusive), so after the loop completes, `i` will be `n-2`.
- **`n` remains unchanged:** The value of `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and is not modified by the loop.
- **`l` remains unchanged:** The list `l` is read from input and is not modified by the loop.
- **`d1` is updated based on the loop conditions:** The dictionary `d1` is updated during each iteration of the loop. For each `i` from 1 to `n-2`:
  - If `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[i + 2]` is set to `1 + d1[i + 1]`.
  - Otherwise, `d1[i + 2]` is set to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.
- **`d2` remains unchanged:** The dictionary `d2` is initialized with default values of 0 and is not modified by the loop.
