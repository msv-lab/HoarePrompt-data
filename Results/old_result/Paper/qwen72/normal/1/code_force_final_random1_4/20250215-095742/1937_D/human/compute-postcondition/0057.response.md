Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `-1`, `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` will contain the calculated values for each position of '<' characters in the string `s`, and `idx_B` will contain the indices of these '<' characters. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `-1` because the loop iterates from `n-1` down to `0`, and the final decrement of `i` will make it `-1`.
- **`A` and `idx_A`**: These lists will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`. For each position `i` where `s[i]` is '>', `idx_A` will store the index `i`, and `A` will store the calculated value `x` as defined in the loop.
- **`B` and `idx_B`**: These lists will contain the calculated values and indices for each position of '<' characters in the string `s`. For each position `i` where `s[i]` is '<', `idx_B` will store the index `i`, and `B` will store the calculated value `x` as defined in the loop. If there are no '<' characters in `s`, both `B` and `idx_B` will remain empty.
