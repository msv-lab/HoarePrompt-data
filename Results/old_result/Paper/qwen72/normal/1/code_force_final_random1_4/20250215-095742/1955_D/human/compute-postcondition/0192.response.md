Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, `b_values` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0. If `a[1]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[1]]` is greater than or equal to 0 after decrementing, `curr` is 2. Otherwise, `curr` remains 0. If `a[1]` is not in `b_values`, `curr` remains 0.***
