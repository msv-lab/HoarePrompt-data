Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the initial input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `i` is the index where `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` or `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new` is a list where each element up to index `i-1` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and `new[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`, `new2` is a list where each element up to index `i-1` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and `new2[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])`, the remaining elements are `None`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to the length of `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])` updates the `new2` list at index `i` with the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
- The updated `new2` list now has the minimum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` at index `i`, while the rest of the list remains as described in the initial state.
