Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 0
    i = 0
    d = n
    h = n
    p = 1
    g = 0
    if k > (n + 1) // 2:
        while s < k and d > 0:
            s += (d + 1) // 2
            d -= (d + 1) // 2
            i += 1
        while p <= i - 1:
            g += (h + 1) // 2
            h -= (h + 1) // 2
            p += 1
        f = k - g
        y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)
        print(y)
    else:
        print(2 * k - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is a placeholder, `n` and `k` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 5 · 10^4). If `k` > `(n + 1) // 2`, then `s` is `k`, `i` is the number of iterations it took to reach or exceed `k`, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is `i`, `g` is the sum of the series of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration, `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is 2. Otherwise, if `k` ≤ `(n + 1) // 2`, then `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, and `g` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` and `k` are updated to the input values, which are positive integers (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 5 · 10^4). `_` is a placeholder, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is equal to `n`, `h` is equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` and `y` retain their initial values or conditions. If `k > (n + 1) // 2`, after the loop executes all iterations, `i` is at least 2, `g` is increased by the sum of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration, `h` is decreased by `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration, `p` is equal to `i`, `f` is equal to `k - g`, and `y` is equal to 2. If `k ≤ (n + 1) // 2`, the values of `n`, `k`, `_`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, and `y` remain as initially set.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 50,000, `_` is a placeholder, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is equal to `n`, `h` is equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and `f` and `y` retain their initial values or conditions. If `k > (n + 1) // 2`, then `s` equals `k` or the sum of the series of `(d + 1) // 2` until `s >= k` or `d <= 0`, `i` is the number of iterations it took to reach this condition, `d` is the remaining value after subtracting `(d + 1) // 2` from `n` multiple times, `h` is the remaining value after subtracting `(h + 1) // 2` from `h` `i-1` times, `p` is `i`, `g` is the sum of the series of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration, `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is now `2`. If `k <= (n + 1) // 2`, then `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, and `y` retain their initial values or conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
