### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the function `func_1` to verify its correctness based on the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Parameters:** `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`.
   - **Initialization:**
     - `b` is an empty list to store the elements removed from `a`.
     - `l` is initialized to 0 (left index).
     - `r` is initialized to `n - 1` (right index).
   - **Processing Commands:**
     - For each command in `s`:
       - If the command is 'L', append the element at index `l` to `b` and increment `l`.
       - If the command is 'R', append the element at index `r` to `b` and decrement `r`.
   - **Calculating the Product Modulo `m`:**
     - Initialize `p` to 1.
     - Iterate over the elements in `b` in reverse order:
       - Update `p` to `(p * v) % m`.
       - Append `p` to `ans`.
   - **Return Value:**
     - Return `ans` in reverse order.

### Verification:

1. **Correctness of Command Processing:**
   - The function correctly processes the commands 'L' and 'R' by updating the indices `l` and `r` and appending the appropriate elements to `b`.
   - This ensures that the elements are removed from the correct end of the array `a` based on the command.

2. **Correctness of Product Calculation:**
   - The product is calculated in reverse order of the elements in `b` to ensure that the product is updated correctly after each removal.
   - The use of `p = p * v % m` ensures that the product is always taken modulo `m`.

3. **Output Order:**
   - The function returns the results in reverse order, which matches the requirement of the problem statement to output the remainders in the order of the commands.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Array:**
  - If `n = 1`, the function correctly processes the single command and returns the correct remainder.
- **All 'L' or All 'R' Commands:**
  - The function handles these cases by correctly updating the indices and removing elements from the appropriate end.
- **Mixed 'L' and 'R' Commands:**
  - The function correctly processes mixed commands and maintains the correct indices.

### Conclusion:
The provided program and the function `func_1` correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The function processes the commands, updates the indices, and calculates the product modulo `m` as required. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
