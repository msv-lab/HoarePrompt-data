To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `tc` is an input integer and must be greater than 0 but now `tc` is `tc - 1` and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `dp` is `True`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `n`.
- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 (since `range(1, n)` will generate values from 1 to `n-1`).

### Adjustments Needed:
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
- `i` is not initialized in the loop head; it is controlled by the `range(1, n)`.

### Final State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `tc` is an input integer and must be greater than 0 but now `tc` is `tc - 1` and must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `dp` is `True`.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is an input integer and must be greater than 0 but now `tc` is `tc - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a 0, `i` is `n-1`, `dp` is `True`**
