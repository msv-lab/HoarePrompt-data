Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing at least two elements, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0, `pow` is 2. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, then `tot` is updated to `tot + a` where `a` is the next element in `L`. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `m`, `tot`, and `pow` remain unchanged.***
