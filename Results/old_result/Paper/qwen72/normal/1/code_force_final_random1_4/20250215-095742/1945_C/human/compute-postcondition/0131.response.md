Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `ele` is the last element of `lst` that was processed in the loop, `lst` must have at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `lst`, all other variables (`n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `c1`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged, and `final` is a list containing the second element of `lst` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element of `lst` is equal to `mini`; otherwise, `final` contains the third element of `lst`.**
