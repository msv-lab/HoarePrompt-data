The code snippet `smin.append(suf[i + 1])` appends the value of `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Let's analyze the impact of this code:

- `t` remains an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `j` remains 0.
- `b` remains a list of strings from the input.
- `n` remains the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0.
- `k` remains the integer value of the second element in `b`.
- `l` remains a list of integers from the input.
- `suf` remains a list containing `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `suf` and the corresponding element in `l`.
- `i` remains `n - 2`.
- `smin` initially contains two elements. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` contains 0 and `suf[n]`, and `suf[n]` is less than 0. Otherwise, `smin` contains two zeros, and `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `smin` now contains three elements. The third element is `suf[i + 1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `suf` and the corresponding element in `l`, `i` is `n - 2`, `smin` is a list containing three elements where the first two elements are as described in the initial state and the third element is `suf[i + 1]`.**
