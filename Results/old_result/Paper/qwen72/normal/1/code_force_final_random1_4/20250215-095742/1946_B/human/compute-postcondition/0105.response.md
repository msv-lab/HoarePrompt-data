The code snippet `b = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it by whitespace, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `b`.

Output State: **`smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 0, `t`, `j` is `j + 1`, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `k`, `l`, and `suf` retain their initial values and conditions. If `sm` is less than 0, `sm` is now equal to `2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * (10`. Otherwise, `sm` is now equal to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10`.**
