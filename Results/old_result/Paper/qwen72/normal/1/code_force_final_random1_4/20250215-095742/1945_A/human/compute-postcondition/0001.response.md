The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, s.split())` updates the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` by splitting the string `s` into parts and converting each part to an integer. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are now the integers obtained from the split parts of `s`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers obtained from splitting and converting the string `s`, and `s` is the first element of the list created from the second line onward of the standard input, implying that the standard input has at least two lines.**
