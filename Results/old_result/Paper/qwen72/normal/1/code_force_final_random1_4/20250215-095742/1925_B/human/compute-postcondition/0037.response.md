Postcondition: ***The loop will execute if `x` is at least 1. The initial value of `i` in the loop head is 1. The current value of `i` is such that `x % i == 0`. If `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
