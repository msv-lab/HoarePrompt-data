Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The `solve` function is expected to handle the processing of each set of input data, where each set includes the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges to remove `k`, with the constraints \(1 \le k < n \le 10^5\). Additionally, `n - 1` lines follow, each containing two integers `v` and `u` representing an edge in the tree, with \(1 \le v, u \le n\).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
    solve()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The number of sets of input data (read from `sys.stdin.readline()` and converted to an integer) must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, and the function `solve()` has been called.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The number of sets of input data is greater than 0, `_` is 1, and the function `solve()` has been called.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The number of sets of input data is greater than 2, `_` is 2, and the function `solve()` has been called.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
