To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `j` and `n`.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24.
- `j` is 1.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- The value of `nx` is determined based on the conditions given.

### Loop Head:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24.
3. **Next Iteration**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will be 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified in the loop head.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is 2.
- `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24.
- The value of `i` and `nx` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2, `i` is `n + 1`**.
