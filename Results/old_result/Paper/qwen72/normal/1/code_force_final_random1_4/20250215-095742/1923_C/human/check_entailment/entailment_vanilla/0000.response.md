### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if a subarray `c[l..r]` is "good" based on the given conditions.
   - A subarray is "good" if there exists another array `b` such that:
     1. The sum of elements in `c[l..r]` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
     2. No element in `c[l..r]` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
     3. All elements in `b` are positive.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For a subarray to be "good," it must have at least one element that can be changed to a different positive value while maintaining the same sum.
   - If the subarray has only one element, it cannot be "good" because there is no other element to change it to without violating the conditions.
   - If the subarray has more than one element, we need to check if the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements is at least the number of elements with value 1. This ensures that we can change each element to a different positive value.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `m`.
   - It reads the array `l` and initializes two prefix sum arrays `p` and `c`:
     - `p` stores the prefix sums of the array `l`.
     - `c` stores the prefix counts of the number of 1s in the array `l`.
   - For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray `c[l..r]` and the count of 1s in the subarray.
   - It checks if the subarray is "good" by verifying the condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, where `s` is the sum of the subarray, `b - a + 1` is the length of the subarray, and `i` is the count of 1s in the subarray.
   - If the condition is met and the subarray has more than one element, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the subarray has only one element.
   - The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` ensures that the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements is at least the number of 1s, which is necessary for the subarray to be "good".
   - The program efficiently uses prefix sums and prefix counts to handle multiple queries in linear time.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
