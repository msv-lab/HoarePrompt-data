The code snippet `ans += 2 * y` updates the value of `ans` by adding `2 * y` to its current value. Given the initial state:

- `x` is greater than or equal to 0
- `i` is `x - 1`
- `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`
- `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`
- `ans` is `ans + sum(odd)`
- `n`, `a`, `st`, `y` remain unchanged
- `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`
- `gap` is the first element of `even`
- `odd` is a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element
- `even` is a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element
- `y` is 0, and the current value of `y` is less than `gap // 2`

Since `y` is 0, `2 * y` is also 0. Therefore, `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + sum(odd)`, `n`, `a`, `st`, `y` remain unchanged, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the first element of `even`, `odd` is a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element, `even` is a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element, `y` is 0, and the current value of `y` is less than `gap // 2`.**
