Output State: **`delta` is the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `rest` is now `rest - delta - delta`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`, `x` is a list of integers, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is the length of `a` and `x`, `sorted_indices` is a list of indices sorted based on the absolute values of the corresponding elements in `x`, `distance` is 0, `len(sorted_indices) > 0`, the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` or `x[sorted_indices[pos-2]]` (depending on the condition) is not equal to `distance`, and `pos` is incremented by 1 if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `rest -= delta` reduces the value of `rest` by `delta`.
- Initially, `rest` was already reduced by `delta` (`rest` is now `rest - delta`).
- After executing the code, `rest` is further reduced by `delta`, making it `rest - delta - delta`.
- The value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is also reduced by `delta`, which remains unchanged from the initial state.
- All other conditions and variables remain the same as in the initial state.
