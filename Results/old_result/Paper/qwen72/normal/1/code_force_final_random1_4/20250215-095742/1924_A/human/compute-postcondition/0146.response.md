Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 or `k + 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has been reset to 0, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to be reset to 0, `cur` is 0 or a bitmask representing the characters seen so far in the current sequence, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`**: These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`s`**: This variable is the input string and remains unchanged.
- **`cnt`**: This variable counts how many times the bitmask `cur` has been reset to 0 because it reached `(1 << k) - 1`.
- **`ans`**: This string accumulates the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to be reset to 0.
- **`cur`**: This variable is a bitmask that tracks which characters have been seen in the current sequence. It is reset to 0 each time it reaches `(1 << k) - 1`.
- **`tmp`**: This variable holds the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set. It is recalculated after each iteration based on the current value of `cur`.

This output state reflects the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
