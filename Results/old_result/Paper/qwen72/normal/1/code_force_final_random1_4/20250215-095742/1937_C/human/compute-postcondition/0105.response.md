The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is the new input string. If `res` is `<`, then `k` is set to 1 and `best` is set to 1. Otherwise, `k` and `best` retain their initial values (which are 1 and 0, respectively).**
