Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic used to calculate the number of screens required is flawed. Specifically, the calculation `m = 15 * z - y * 4` and the subsequent check `if m < a:` do not accurately reflect the constraints and requirements of the problem. The variable `a` should represent the total number of test cases, not be used in the calculation of the number of screens required. Additionally, the logic for determining how many additional screens are needed when there are leftover 1x1 icons is incorrect.

A correct approach would involve calculating the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons first, then determining how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space, and finally calculating any additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (y + 1) // 2
        # Calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_space = 15 * screens_for_2x2 - y * 4
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons
        additional_screens = (x - remaining_space + 14) // 15
        # Total screens required
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens
        print(total_screens)
```

This corrected version should handle the problem as specified in the problem description.
