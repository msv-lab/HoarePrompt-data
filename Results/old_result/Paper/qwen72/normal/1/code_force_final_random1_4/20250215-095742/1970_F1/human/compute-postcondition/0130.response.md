Additionally, either `obj` is not equal to '.B' or `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is false, and either `isPlayer(obj)` is false or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`. The current value of `com` is 'T'. `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`. The current value of `goalIn(pos)` is not -1. `team` is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`. `points[team]` is increased by 1.**
