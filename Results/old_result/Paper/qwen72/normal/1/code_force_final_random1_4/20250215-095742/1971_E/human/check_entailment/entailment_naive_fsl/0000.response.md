Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to handle all aspects of the problem description correctly. It reads the input as specified, processes the queries efficiently using binary search to find the segment in which the query lies, and calculates the time taken to reach the point `d` accurately. The rounding down of the result is also handled correctly by converting the final result to an integer before printing. No edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would cause the program to fail for any valid input according to the problem constraints.
