Output State: **`i` is `n - 1 - j`, `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is `[0]`, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the character at position `i` in the string `s` is '<', and the length of `idx_B` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `B.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the list `B`. The list `B` was initially empty, so after executing the code, `B` contains the single element `0`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
