Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a user-provided string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, and `h` is the substring of `s` from index 0 to 1 (inclusive). The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, the hour part of the time has been converted to 12-hour format and printed with AM/PM notation. The final state of `t` is 0, and the final state of `s` and `h` is the last user-provided values before the loop ended.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` starts as an integer between 1 and 1440 and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0, indicating the loop has completed all iterations.
- The variable `s` is updated with each user input during each iteration, and its final value is the last user-provided string before the loop ends.
- The variable `h` is derived from `s` in each iteration and is used to convert the time to 12-hour format and print it with AM/PM notation.
- The loop prints the converted time for each iteration, but the final state of `s` and `h` is the last values provided by the user before the loop ends.
