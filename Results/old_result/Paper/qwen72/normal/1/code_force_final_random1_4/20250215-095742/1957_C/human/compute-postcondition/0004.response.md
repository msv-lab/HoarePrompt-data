The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 4), and `n` must still be at least 4 for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 4, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7**
