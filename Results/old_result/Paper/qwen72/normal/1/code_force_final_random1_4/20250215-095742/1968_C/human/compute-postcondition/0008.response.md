The code snippet `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` updates the value of `a[i]` based on the values of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Given the initial state:

- `_` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `x` is a list of integers derived from user input
- `a` is a list of length `n` where the first element is 1000, the second element is `1000 + x[0]`, and the rest are 0
- `i` is 2

The value of `a[i]` (which is `a[2]`) is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, which translates to `a[1] + x[1]`.

Given:
- `a[1] = 1000 + x[0]`
- `x[1]` is the second element of the list `x`

Therefore, `a[2]` becomes `(1000 + x[0]) + x[1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` where the first element is 1000, the second element is `1000 + x[0]`, the third element is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`, and the rest are 0, `i` is 2**.
