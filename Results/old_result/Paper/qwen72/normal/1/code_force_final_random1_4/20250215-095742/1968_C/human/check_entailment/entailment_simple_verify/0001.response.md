Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list `x`.

2. **Array Initialization**: The array `a` is initialized with zeros, which is a standard practice for pre-allocating memory.

3. **Setting the First Element**: The first element of `a` is set to 1000. This choice is arbitrary but must be large enough to ensure that the subsequent elements can satisfy the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \). The value 1000 is sufficiently large given the constraints \( 1 \le x_i \le 500 \).

4. **Constructing the Array `a`**:
   - For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, the value of `a[i]` is set to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.
   - This ensures that \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i \) because:
     - \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \)
     - Therefore, \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = (a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}) \bmod a_{i-1} = x_{i-1} \)

5. **Output**: The constructed array `a` is printed for each test case.

### Verification:
- **Constraints**: The values of `a_i` are within the range \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \), which is satisfied since `a[0]` is 1000 and each subsequent element is at most 1000 plus the maximum value of `x_i` (which is 500). This ensures that the values do not exceed \( 10^9 \).
- **Correctness of the Remainder Condition**: The construction \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \) ensures that the remainder condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) holds true for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly constructs the array `a` for each test case and satisfies the problem's requirements.

Final: **True**
