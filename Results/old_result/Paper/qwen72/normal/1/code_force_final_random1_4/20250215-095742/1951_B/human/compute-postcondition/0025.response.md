To determine what will be printed by the `print(ind)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `x` is equal to `a[14]`.
   - `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`.
   - `c` is 2.
   - `i` is the index of the second element in `a` that is greater than `x`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `k` is equal to 14.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `x` is the 15th element in the list `a` (since Python uses 0-based indexing, `a[14]` is the 15th element).
   - `ind` is a list that contains the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`.

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - To find the values of `ind`, we need to identify the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`.
   - Since the exact values of `a` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical indices. However, we know that `ind` will contain two indices.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(ind)` statement will print the list `ind`, which contains the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be:
Output: **[index1, index2] (where index1 and index2 are the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`)**
