Output State: **`smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements. Each element in `smin` is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index. The variable `i` is equal to `n - 1`. The variable `sm` is now `-111`. All other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `suf`) retain their initial values and conditions as described in the precondition.**
