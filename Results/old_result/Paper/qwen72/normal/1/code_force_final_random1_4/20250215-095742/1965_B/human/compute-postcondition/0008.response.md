Functionality: ** The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It iterates a number of times determined by the return value of `func_10()`. In each iteration, it prints the result of `func_14()` to the standard output followed by a newline character. After the function completes, the standard output will contain the results of `func_14()` printed the same number of times as the value returned by `func_10()`. **
