To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation of `ans` step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `x - 1` (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` (this variable is also not used in the print statement).
   - `gap` is the last element of `even`.
   - `odd` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `even` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `y` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `ans` is computed as `ans + sum(odd) + sum(even) - sum(gap // 2 for gap in even)`.

2. **Computation of `ans`:**
   - `sum(odd)` is the sum of all elements in the `odd` list.
   - `sum(even)` is the sum of all elements in the `even` list.
   - `gap` is the last element of the `even` list.
   - `sum(gap // 2 for gap in even)` is the sum of the integer division of each element in the `even` list by 2.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - `ans` is updated by adding the sum of the `odd` list, the sum of the `even` list, and then subtracting the sum of the integer division of each element in the `even` list by 2.

Given the initial state and the computation, the final value of `ans` will be:
\[ \text{ans} = \text{ans} + \sum(\text{odd}) + \sum(\text{even}) - \sum(\text{gap} // 2 \text{ for gap in even}) \]

Since the initial value of `ans` is not explicitly given, we assume it starts from 0 (if not specified otherwise).

Therefore, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will be:
\[ \text{Output: } \sum(\text{odd}) + \sum(\text{even}) - \sum(\text{gap} // 2 \text{ for gap in even}) \]

In natural language:
Output: **sum(odd) + sum(even) - sum(gap // 2 for gap in even) (where odd is the sum of all elements in the odd list, even is the sum of all elements in the even list, and gap // 2 for gap in even is the sum of the integer division of each element in the even list by 2)**
