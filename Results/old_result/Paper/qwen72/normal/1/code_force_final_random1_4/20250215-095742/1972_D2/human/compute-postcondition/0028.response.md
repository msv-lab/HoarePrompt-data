Output State: **`n` must be at least 8, `m` must be at least 8, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `cnt` is the initial value of `cnt` plus `min(n / 12, m // 12)` if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n` must be at least 8, `m` must be at least 8, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, and `cnt` is the initial value of `cnt` plus `min(n / 6, m // 3)` if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged.
- The code snippet updates `cnt` by adding `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.
- Since `x` is 2 and `y` is 2, `(x + y) * x` is `4 * 2 = 8`, and `(x + y) * y` is also `4 * 2 = 8`.
- Therefore, the expression simplifies to `min(n / 8, m // 8)`.
- However, the initial condition already states that `cnt` is updated by `min(n / 6, m // 3)` if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`. Since `math.gcd(2, 2) == 2` (not 1), the initial condition does not apply, and `cnt` remains unchanged.
- Thus, the final value of `cnt` is the initial value of `cnt` plus `min(n / 12, m // 12)` if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged.
