The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `_` becomes 2), and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the new input.**
