The function `func_12` accepts four parameters: `d`, `processing`, `da`, and `rank`.

- `d` is a dictionary where the keys are integers and the values are lists of integers.
- `processing` is a list of integers, with the same length as the maximum value in `d`'s keys, initialized to 0.
- `da` is an integer key present in `d`.
- `rank` is a list of integers of the same length as `processing`, initialized to 0.

The function has two possible return cases:

- **Case_1**: The function returns 1.
- **Case_2**: The function returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value obtained from all calls to `func_12` for which `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0, and `rank[da - 1]` is updated to this returned value.

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer `da`, and a list `rank`. It returns 1 in one case, and in another case, it returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value from recursive calls to `func_12` under specific conditions, and updates `rank[da - 1]` to this returned value.**
