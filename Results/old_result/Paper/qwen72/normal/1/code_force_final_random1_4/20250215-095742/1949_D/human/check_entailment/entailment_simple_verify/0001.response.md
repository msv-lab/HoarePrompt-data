### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the integer `n` and initializes the lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of funny (`F`) and scary (`S`) transitions involving each scenario.
   - It reads the input matrix `xx` and updates `a` and `b` accordingly. This step is crucial for understanding the current state of the transition videos.

2. **Identifying Scenarios with Known Transitions:**
   - The program creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to store scenarios that have only funny or only scary transitions, respectively. This helps in identifying which scenarios have a clear preference for one type of transition over the other.

3. **Handling Undecided Transitions:**
   - The program checks if the number of scenarios with only funny transitions (`sa`) is greater than or equal to those with only scary transitions (`sb`). If so, it assigns the remaining transitions to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type occur.
   - If the number of scenarios with only scary transitions (`sb`) is greater, the program does the opposite. This ensures a balanced distribution of transition types.

4. **Output Generation:**
   - The program constructs the final transition matrix by assigning 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions based on the conditions set in the previous steps.
   - It prints the final transition matrix, ensuring that the output is in the required format and respects the constraints of the problem, including the symmetry of the transition matrix and the limit on consecutive transitions.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Input Parsing and Initialization:**
  - The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary data structures.
  - It correctly updates the counts of funny and scary transitions for each scenario.

- **Correctness of Handling Undecided Transitions:**
  - The logic for handling undecided transitions ensures that the number of consecutive transitions of the same type does not exceed \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\).
  - The program uses a balanced approach to distribute the transitions, ensuring that the requirement is met.

- **Output Generation:**
  - The program correctly generates the output matrix and prints it in the required format.
  - It respects the constraints of the problem, including the symmetry of the transition matrix and the limit on consecutive transitions.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It ensures that the transition videos meet the specified constraints and outputs a valid solution.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
