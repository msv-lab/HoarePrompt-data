Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, and `word` is determined as follows: If `n` > 52, `word` is the string consisting of the character at index `n - 53` in the `alphabet` list followed by `'zz'`. If `n` is between 27 and 52 (inclusive), `word` is `'a'` + the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` list + `'z'`. If `n` is between 1 and 26 (inclusive), `word` is `'aa'` followed by the character at index `n - 3` in the `alphabet` list.***
