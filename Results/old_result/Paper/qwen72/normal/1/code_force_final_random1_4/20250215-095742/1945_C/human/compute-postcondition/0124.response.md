Postcondition: **`mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `ele` is the last element of `lst` that was processed in the loop, `lst` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `lst`, all other variables (`n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `c1`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged, except `final` which is now an empty list. Additionally, the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.**
