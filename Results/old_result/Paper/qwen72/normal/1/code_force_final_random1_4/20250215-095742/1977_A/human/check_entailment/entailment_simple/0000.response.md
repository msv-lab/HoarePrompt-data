Reasoning:  
The provided solution checks various conditions to determine if it's possible to have a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Let's break down the logic:

1. **If `n == m`:** This means Nikita can simply add a cube in each of the `n` moves to get exactly `m` cubes. This condition is correct.
2. **If `m > n`:** It's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves because each move can only add or remove one cube. This condition is also correct.
3. **If `m == n - 1`:** This means Nikita can add a cube in `n-1` moves and then remove one cube in the last move, ending up with `m` cubes. This condition is correct.
4. **If `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`:** If both `m` and `n` are even, it is possible to achieve `m` cubes. This is because the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of moves and the final number of cubes must match. This condition is correct.
5. **If `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`:** Similarly, if both `m` and `n` are odd, it is possible to achieve `m` cubes. This condition is correct.
6. **Else:** If none of the above conditions are met, it is not possible to achieve `m` cubes. This condition is correct.

However, there is a potential issue with the logic. The conditions should cover all possible scenarios, but the current implementation might miss some edge cases. Specifically, the conditions `m == n - 1` and the parity checks (`m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` and `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`) are not mutually exclusive and might overlap, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

A simpler and more robust approach would be to check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and the parity of the number of moves must match the parity of the difference between the initial and final number of cubes.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

This version correctly handles all cases by checking if the difference between `n` and `m` is even.

Given the original program, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
