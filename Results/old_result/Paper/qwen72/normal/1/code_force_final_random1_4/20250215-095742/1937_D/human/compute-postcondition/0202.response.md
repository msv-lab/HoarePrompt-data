Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`: 
- If `l` is 0, no additional changes occur.
- Otherwise, `a` is assigned the value of `A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is assigned the value of `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 2) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 2) * l`. If `r - l >= 0`, `b` is further modified to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 2) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 2) * l`.

If `l` is greater than `r`:
- If `r` was initially 0, no further changes occur.
- Otherwise, `a` is set to `B[r-1]`, and if `l - r - 1 > 0`, `b` is set to `A[l-1] - A[l-r-2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. If `l - r - 1 <= 0`, `b` is set to `A[l-1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.***
