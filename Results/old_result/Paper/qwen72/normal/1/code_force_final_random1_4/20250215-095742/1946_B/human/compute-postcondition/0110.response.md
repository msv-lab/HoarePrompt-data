Output State: **`smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b`, `t` retains its initial value and conditions, `j` is `j + 1`, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `suf` is a list containing one element `[0]`, and `sm` is updated based on the condition: if `sm` is less than 0, `sm` is now equal to `2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * (10`; otherwise, `sm` is now equal to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10`.**
