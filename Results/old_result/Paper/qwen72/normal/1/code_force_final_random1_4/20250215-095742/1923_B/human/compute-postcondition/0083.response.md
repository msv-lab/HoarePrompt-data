Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `a`, a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster; `x`, a list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster relative to the player's position; and `k`, a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second. The function processes the monsters in order of their proximity to the player, reducing their health with the available bullets until either all monsters are defeated or a monster reaches the player's position. If any monster reaches the player's position before being defeated, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, if all monsters are defeated before reaching the player, the function returns `True`. After the function concludes, the `a` list contains the remaining health of each monster, which will be all zeros if all monsters were defeated. The `x` and `k` parameters remain unchanged. **
