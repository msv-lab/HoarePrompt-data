Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `i` is 0, the first character of the string `s` is not 'L', `b` is a list that now includes the element `a[r-1]`, `r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The list `b` still includes the element `a[r]` from before, but since `r` is now `r-1`, the current element `a[r]` would be the next element in the list `a` if accessed again.
