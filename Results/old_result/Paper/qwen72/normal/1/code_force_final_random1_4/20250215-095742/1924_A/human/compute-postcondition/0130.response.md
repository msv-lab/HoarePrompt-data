The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ss` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has more characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character, and `ss` is the first character of `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 2 characters, and `ss` will be the second character of `s`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 or `k + 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `ans` is an empty string or the string containing the first character of `s`, `cur` is either unchanged or set to 0, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` was initially `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `s`, and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `ans` remains an empty string, and `cur` remains unchanged.**
