Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into multiple parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `a`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from the initial state.
- The value of `x` remains unchanged as well.
- Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `a` as a list of integers input by the user, while the other variables retain their original values.
