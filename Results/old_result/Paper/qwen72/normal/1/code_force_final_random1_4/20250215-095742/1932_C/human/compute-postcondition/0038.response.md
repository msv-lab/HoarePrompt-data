The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. 

- `n` and `m` are positive integers with constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers, each within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.

The function returns a list `ans` in reverse order, where `ans` contains the cumulative product of the elements in `b` modulo `m`, starting from the last element of `b` and moving towards the first. The final value of the cumulative product modulo `m` is stored in `p`.
