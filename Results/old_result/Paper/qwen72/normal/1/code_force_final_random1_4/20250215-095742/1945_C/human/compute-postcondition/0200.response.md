Output State: **`mini` will be the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`, `ele` is the third element in `lst`, `lst` must have at least three elements. If `abs(pk - elem)` is equal to `mini`, `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst` and `elem`, and `elem` has been appended to `final`. Otherwise, `final` is a list containing only `elem`. All other variables remain unchanged.**
