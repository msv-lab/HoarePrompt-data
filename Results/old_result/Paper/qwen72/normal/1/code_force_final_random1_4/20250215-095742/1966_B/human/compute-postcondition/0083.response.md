Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, and `ans` is 'NO'. If any pair of consecutive sublists in `gr` has different first elements or different last elements, `impossible` is set to False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-2` (since `range(n-1)`).
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1`.
- The variable `impossible` will be set to `False` if any pair of consecutive sublists in `gr` has different first elements or different last elements.
- If no such pairs exist, `impossible` remains `True`.
- The other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `j`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
