Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `smin` is a list containing a single element 0, `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 1, `b` is a list of strings from the new input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the new input, `suf` is now a list containing `n + 1` elements starting with 0 and followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is updated based on certain conditions.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if suf[i + 1] < smin[i]:
        smin.append(suf[i + 1])
    else:
        smin.append(smin[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`smin` is a list containing two elements. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, `smin` is updated to [0, `suf[1]`]. Otherwise, `smin` remains [0, 0]. All other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `suf`, `i`, and `sm`) retain their initial values and conditions as described in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`smin` is a list containing three elements. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, the third element of `smin` is updated to `suf[i + 1]`. Otherwise, the third element of `smin` remains `smin[i]`. `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`. All other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `suf`, and `sm`) retain their initial values and conditions as described in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`smin` is a list containing four elements (the original three elements plus either `suf[i + 1]` if `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]`, or the element at index `i` otherwise). `i` is incremented by 1, `i` must be less than `n`, and all other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `suf`, and `sm`) retain their initial values and conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
