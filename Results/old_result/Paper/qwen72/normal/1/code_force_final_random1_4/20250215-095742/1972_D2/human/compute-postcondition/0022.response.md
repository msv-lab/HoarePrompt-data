To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
   - `x` is 2.
   - `y` is 1.
   - `cnt` is the sum of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs of `x` and `y` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and the conditions \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\) are satisfied.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute if both \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\) are true.

3. **Substitute Initial Values:**
   - \(x = 2\)
   - \(y = 1\)
   - Therefore, \((x + y) * x = (2 + 1) * 2 = 6\)
   - And, \((x + y) * y = (2 + 1) * 1 = 3\)

4. **Check Conditions:**
   - For the loop to execute, both \(6 \leq n\) and \(3 \leq m\) must be true.

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since \(x\) and \(y\) are fixed and cannot be adjusted, we need to ensure that \(n\) and \(m\) satisfy the conditions \(6 \leq n\) and \(3 \leq m\).

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the loop will execute if \(n \geq 6\) and \(m \geq 3\). Since \(n\) and \(m\) are already positive integers within the range \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), we need to ensure that they meet the minimum requirements for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` and `m` remain positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(n \geq 6\) and \(m \geq 3\), `x` is 2, `y` is 1, and `cnt` is the sum of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs of `x` and `y` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and the conditions \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\) are satisfied.**
