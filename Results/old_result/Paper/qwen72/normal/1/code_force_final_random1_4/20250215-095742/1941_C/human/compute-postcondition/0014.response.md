Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.** 

Explanation: The variable `s` is updated to a new input string provided by the user. The values of `_`, `t`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, but `x` and `y` will be recalculated based on the new value of `s`.
