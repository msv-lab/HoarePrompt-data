Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`, `1` is in `lis`, the length of `lis` is greater than 1, `test` is True, and `j` is the index where the loop broke out or reached the end of the list `lis`. If the difference between any two consecutive elements in `lis` is greater than 1, the loop prints 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on the parity of `j` and sets `test` to False, breaking out of the loop. Otherwise, the loop completes without printing anything and `test` remains False. Additionally, the length of `lis` is either odd or even depending on the condition evaluated in the if-else block.***
