Reasoning: 

The original assessment identifies a critical flaw in the program's logic, specifically in the condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:`. This condition is indeed too restrictive and can lead to incorrect results, as demonstrated by the example `(0, 2, 4)`. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Total Points and Matches Calculation**:
   - The total points are calculated as `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`.
   - The total number of matches is calculated as `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.

2. **Condition for Validity**:
   - The program checks if `total_points % 2 != 0`. If the total points are odd, it immediately returns `-1` because the total points must be even for the scores to be valid.
   - The program then checks if `total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs`. This condition is too restrictive. The number of matches can be more than 3, and the highest score (`p3`) can be greater than the total number of matches if there are draws.

3. **Calculation of Draws**:
   - The program calculates the number of draws as `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - If `egalites < 0`, it returns `-1` because a negative number of draws is not possible.
   - Otherwise, it returns `egalites // 2`.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `(0, 2, 4)`, the total points are `6`, which is even.
   - The total matches are `6 // 2 = 3`.
   - The program incorrectly returns `-1` because `p3 > total_matchs` evaluates to `4 > 3`, which is true.
   - However, it is possible to achieve the scores `(0, 2, 4)` with 2 draws and 1 win/loss game:
     - Player 1 vs Player 2: Draw (1 point each)
     - Player 1 vs Player 2: Draw (1 point each)
     - Player 2 vs Player 3: Player 3 wins (2 points to Player 3)
   - Therefore, the correct output for this case should be `2`.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw in the program. The condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:` is indeed too restrictive and leads to incorrect results for valid inputs.

Final: **False**
