Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `suf` and the corresponding element in `l`, `i` is `n + 1`, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value of the suffix sums up to that index in `suf`, `sm` is now `suf[n] + 2 + (a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)` and is less than 0, `a` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `sm += (a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)` updates the value of `sm`.
- Initially, `sm` is `suf[n] + 2` and is less than 0.
- `a` is 0, so `(a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)` evaluates to `1 * (10 ** 9 + 7)`, which is `1000000007`.
- Therefore, `sm` is updated to `suf[n] + 2 + 1000000007`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
