Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, `b` is the value of `A[l - 1]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
- The value of `r` is decreased by 1.
- The value of `a` is set to the value of `B[r]`.
- The new variable `b` is assigned the value of `A[l - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
