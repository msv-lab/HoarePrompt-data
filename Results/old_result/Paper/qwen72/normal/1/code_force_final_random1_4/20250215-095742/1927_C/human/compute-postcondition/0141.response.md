Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers â‰¥ 1, `t` is `t + 2`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2. If `aOnes < bOnes`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1 and `bOnes` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1 and `aOnes` remains unchanged.***
