The code snippet `nx += 'S'` updates the value of `nx` by appending the string 'S' to its current value. Since the initial state specifies that `nx` could be updated based on certain conditions, but does not specify what the initial value of `nx` is, we assume `nx` has some initial value (which could be a string or another type that supports concatenation). After the execution of the code, `nx` will have its original value followed by the string 'S'.

The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus the string 'S'.**
