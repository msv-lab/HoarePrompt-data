Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It processes each test case by:

1. Reading the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
2. Reading the arrays `a` and `b`.
3. Initializing a frequency counter `cnt_b` for the elements of `b`.
4. Counting the initial number of matches (`curr`) in the first subsegment of `a` of length `m`.
5. Sliding the window across the array `a` to check each subsegment of length `m` and updating the count of matches.
6. Resetting the frequency counter `cnt_b` after processing each test case to ensure it is ready for the next test case.

The logic for counting the number of good subsegments and the sliding window mechanism are implemented correctly, ensuring that the program meets the requirements of the problem statement.
