#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and `position` is a positive integer representing the position of the character in the input sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance of infoA and the balance of infoB, where `infoA.balance` is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and `infoB.balance` is another integer representing the balance of a different prefix in the same sequence. The `balance` of infoA is not equal to the `balance` of infoB.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and `position` is a positive integer representing the position of the character in the input sequence. Additionally, `infoA.balance` is equal to `infoB.balance`.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between the positions of the characters in the input sequence represented by `infoB.position` and `infoA.position`. Since `infoA.balance` is equal to `infoB.balance`, both positions refer to characters with the same balance in the parentheses sequence.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `infoA` and `infoB`, which are objects containing attributes `balance` and `position`. The function returns the difference between the `balance` attributes of `infoA` and `infoB` if their balances are not equal. If the balances are equal, it returns the difference between the `position` attributes of `infoB` and `infoA`. In both cases, the function does not modify the input objects and only computes and returns a numerical difference based on the conditions described.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", with a length not exceeding 500,000, and it is a balanced parentheses sequence.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", with a length not exceeding 500,000, and it is a balanced parentheses sequence; `n` is the length of `s` and does not change; `balance_info` is a list containing `n` elements, each a `BalanceInfo` object. Each `BalanceInfo` object in the list has `balance` set to the cumulative balance up to that index, `index` set to the corresponding index in the string `s`, and `char` set to the character at that index in `s`. The final value of `balance` is 0, as the string `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: s (where s is a balanced parentheses sequence)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a non-empty string `s` consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", with a length not exceeding 500,000, and ensures that `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence. It processes the string to create a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, each containing the cumulative balance, the index, and the character at that index. After sorting this list based on the balance and then by the negative index, it constructs a new string from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects and prints this new string, which is also a balanced parentheses sequence. The function does not return any value.
