Output State: **`a` is a list of strings with any number of elements, `y` is the third-to-last element in the list `b`, `b` must be a non-empty collection, `b_values` now contains the integer values of all elements in `b` appended to its existing values, `num_fila` must be greater than `max_p`, all other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, `nf`, `a_values`) retain their original values and relationships as described in the initial state, `custo` is updated to `custo + b_values[y]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `custo += b_values[y]` updates the value of `custo` by adding the value of `b_values[y]` to it.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
