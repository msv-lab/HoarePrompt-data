To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `_` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The state of `u2vs` is not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder (no specific value needed)**
