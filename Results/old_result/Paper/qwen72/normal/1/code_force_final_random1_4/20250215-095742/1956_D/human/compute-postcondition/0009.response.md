Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer read from input (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).
   - `a` is a list of integers read from input (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).
   - `s` and `m` are the first and second values returned by `func_2(a)`, respectively.
   - `ops` is a list of tuples that must contain at least three tuples.
   - `l` is the first element of the third tuple in `ops`.
   - `r` is the second element of the third tuple in `ops`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(l + 1, r + 1)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The third tuple in the `ops` list is accessed, and its first element is assigned to `l`.
   - The second element of the third tuple in the `ops` list is assigned to `r`.
   - The `print` statement will output the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`.

Since the exact values of `l` and `r` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe them based on their positions in the `ops` list.

Output: **l + 1, r + 1 (where l is the first element of the third tuple in the ops list, and r is the second element of the third tuple in the ops list)**
