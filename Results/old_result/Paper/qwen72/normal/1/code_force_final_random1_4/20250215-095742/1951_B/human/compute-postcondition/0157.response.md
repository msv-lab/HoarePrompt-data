Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `s` must have at least `n` elements, `i` is the last element of `s` (i.e., `s[n-1]`), `s[0]` is now the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap, `s[k - 1]` is now the value of `s[0]` before the swap, `s[p]` is now the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap, `h` is the value of `s[k - 1]` before the swap, `j` is `n-2`, `p` is `n-2`, `ans1` is 0, and all other variables (`s`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `z`) remain unchanged.**
