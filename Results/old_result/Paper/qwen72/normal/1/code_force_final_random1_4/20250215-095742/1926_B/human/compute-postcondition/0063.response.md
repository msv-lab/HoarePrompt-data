Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10.
- The grid is represented by `n` lines of `n` characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'.
- The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1.
- `a` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `b` is the last input string provided by the user.
- `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in each input string `b` that contained at least one '1' during all iterations of the loop.
- The first two elements of `k` are not equal (`k[0] != k[1]`).

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('TRIANGLE')
```

The `print` statement will simply print the string 'TRIANGLE'. The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement, as it is a static string.

Output: **TRIANGLE**
