The only objects in the loop head are the variable `y` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 elements, `y` is the second element in the list, and `a_values` contains the integer values of the first and second elements of `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 3 elements, and `y` will be the third element in the list.

State: **`a` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 elements, `y` is the third element in the list `a`, `a_values` contains the integer value of the first element of `a`, the integer value of the second element of `a`, and the integer value of the third element of `a` appended to it.**
