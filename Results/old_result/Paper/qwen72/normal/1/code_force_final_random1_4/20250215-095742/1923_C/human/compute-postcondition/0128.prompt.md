Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `_` is `m` (which was initially 0), `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1, or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`. `l` is a list of integers from user input. `p` is now a list containing a single element `[0]`. `c` is now a list containing a single element `[0]`. `i` is 0, `j` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    if x == 1:
        j += 1
    i += x
    p.append(i)
    c.append(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `l`, `i` is equal to `x`, if `x` is 1, `j` is 1 and `c` is [1]; otherwise, `j` is 0 and `c` is [0], `p` now contains the value of `x` as its first element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element of `l`, `i` is equal to the sum of the first and second elements of `l`, `p` now contains the value of the first element of `l` as its first element and `i` as its second element. If `x` is 1, `j` is 2 and `c` is [1, 2]; otherwise, `j` is 1 and `c` is [0, 1] if the first element of `l` is 1; otherwise, `j` is 0 and `c` is [0, 0].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `l`, `i` is equal to the sum of the first and second elements of `l` plus `x`, `p` now contains the value of the first element of `l` as its first element, `i` as its second element, and `i` again as its third element, `j` is 3 if `x` is 1, 2 if the first element of `l` is 1, and 1 otherwise, `c` is [1, 2, 3] if `x` is 1, [0, 1, 2] if the first element of `l` is 1, and [0, 0, 1] otherwise.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
