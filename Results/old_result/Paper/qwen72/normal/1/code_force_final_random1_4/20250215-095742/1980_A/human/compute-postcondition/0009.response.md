The only object in the loop head is the variable `prob` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in `a`, the loop will continue to execute.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` must contain at least two elements, and `prob` is the second element of `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least three elements, and `prob` will be the third element of `a`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases` and must contain at least three elements, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the element at index 1 is incremented by 1, `prob` is the third element of `a`**
