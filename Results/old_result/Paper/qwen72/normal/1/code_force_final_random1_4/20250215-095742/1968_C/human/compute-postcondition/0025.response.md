Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is a positive integer (at least 1).
- `x` is a list of integers derived from user input.
- `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`.
- `a[0]` is set to 1000.
- For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is set to `1000 + sum(x[:i])`.
- `i` is `n-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*a)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `a`:**
   - `a` is initially a list of length `n` filled with zeros: `[0] * n`.
   - `a[0]` is explicitly set to 1000.

2. **Setting Values in `a`:**
   - For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is set to `1000 + sum(x[:i])`.
     - `x[:i]` is a slice of the list `x` from the start up to but not including index `i`.
     - `sum(x[:i])` calculates the sum of the first `i` elements of `x`.
     - Therefore, `a[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `x` added to 1000.

3. **Final State of `a`:**
   - `a[0] = 1000`
   - `a[1] = 1000 + sum(x[:1])`
   - `a[2] = 1000 + sum(x[:2])`
   - ...
   - `a[n-1] = 1000 + sum(x[:n-1])`

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(*a)` statement unpacks the list `a` and prints its elements separated by spaces.

### Example Calculation:
Suppose `n = 4` and `x = [10, 20, 30]`:
- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = 1000 + sum([10]) = 1000 + 10 = 1010`
- `a[2] = 1000 + sum([10, 20]) = 1000 + 30 = 1030`
- `a[3] = 1000 + sum([10, 20, 30]) = 1000 + 60 = 1060`

So, `a` would be `[1000, 1010, 1030, 1060]`.

### Final Output:
The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Output: **1000 1010 1030 1060 (where the values depend on the specific values in the list `x` and the length `n`)**

In general, the output will be:
Output: **1000 1000 + sum(x[:1]) 1000 + sum(x[:2]) ... 1000 + sum(x[:n-1])**
