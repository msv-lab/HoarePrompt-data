The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function should accept the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the length of the list.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

Since the function's output is not specified, we can infer that the function is expected to process these inputs and produce some form of output for each test case. However, without further details on the specific output, we can only describe the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the length of a list, and `a`, a list of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs and produces some form of output for each test case, but the specific output is not defined in the given information.**
