To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input.
- `idx` is 1.
- For each test case, `n` and `q` are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5.
- `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30.
- Each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
- `results` is an empty list.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.
- The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop condition.
- The loop head only involves the variable `t`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0.
- The other variables (`data`, `idx`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `results`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
