The code snippet `ans += 2 * y` updates the value of `ans` by adding twice the value of `y` to it. Let's break down the impact:

- `ans` was initially updated by `ans + sum(odd) + gap`.
- `y` is defined as `y - (gap // 2)`.

The new value of `ans` will be the previous value of `ans` plus `2 * y`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + sum(odd) + gap + 2 * (y - (gap // 2))`, `n`, `a`, `st`, `y` remain unchanged, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the second element of `even`, `odd` is a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element, `even` is a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element, `y` is `y - (gap // 2)`**.
