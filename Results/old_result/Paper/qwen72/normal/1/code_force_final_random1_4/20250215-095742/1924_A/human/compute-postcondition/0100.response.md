Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0, `cur` is the final value of the bitmask representing the characters seen in the current sequence, `cnt` is less than `n`, and `tmp` is either an empty string or 'a'. If the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'a' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string.***
