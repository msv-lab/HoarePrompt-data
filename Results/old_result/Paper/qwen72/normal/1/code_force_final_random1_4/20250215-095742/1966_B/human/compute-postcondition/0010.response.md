Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the integer provided by the user input, `m` are integers provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` user input strings, `i` is `n-1`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `tc` remains 0.
- The variable `n` retains its value as the integer provided by the user input.
- The variable `m` remains as the integers provided by the user input.
- The list `gr` now contains `n` user input strings, where each string was entered during one iteration of the loop.
- The loop index `i` reaches the value `n-1` after the last iteration, which is the final value before the loop terminates.
