Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input format as specified. `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it calls `func_1` which reads `n` and `m`.

2. **Logic for Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - `func_1` iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` to find pairs `(a, b)` such that `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.
   - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` ensures that `x` and `y` are coprime.
   - The conditions \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\) ensure that the pairs `(a, b)` are within the bounds of `n` and `m`.
   - The count of valid pairs is incremented by `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`, which correctly counts the number of valid pairs for each `(x, y)`.

3. **Output**: The program prints the count of valid pairs for each test case, as required.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` and `m` are small (e.g., `1 1`), correctly outputting `0`.
   - The program also handles larger values of `n` and `m` (e.g., `1000000 1145141`), as demonstrated in the example.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The nested loops ensure that the program efficiently checks all possible pairs within the constraints.

Given the above points, the program meets the problem description and handles all specified conditions correctly.

Correctness: **True**
