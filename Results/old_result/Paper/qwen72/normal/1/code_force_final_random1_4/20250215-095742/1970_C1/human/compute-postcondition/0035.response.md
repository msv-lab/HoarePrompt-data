Output State: **`x` is 1, `lst` contains all the appended values of `b` corresponding to each `a` from the inputs, but the lists within `lst` that were accessed and modified during the loop are now empty, `rev` contains all the appended values of `a` corresponding to each `b` from the inputs except the last element of `rev[z]`, `n`, `u_1`, `y` remain unchanged, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is the last element of `rev[z]` before the pop operation, `one` is False if the total number of iterations is odd, or True if the total number of iterations is even, `two` is True, and `rev[z]` must contain at least one element less than before.**
