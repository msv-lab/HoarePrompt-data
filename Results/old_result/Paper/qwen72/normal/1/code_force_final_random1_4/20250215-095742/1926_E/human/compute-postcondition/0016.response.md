Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the values of the sequence of `(n + 1) // 2` computed during each iteration until `n` becomes 0, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: The loop continues to update `n` by subtracting `(n + 1) // 2` from it until `n` becomes 0. At this point, the loop condition `while n` fails, and the loop terminates.
- **`k`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`L`**: This list accumulates the values of `(n + 1) // 2` computed during each iteration of the loop. Each value added to `L` represents the result of the division `(n + 1) // 2` at that particular iteration.
- **`m`**: This variable holds the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0. After the loop ends, `m` will be the last value computed before `n` was reduced to 0.
