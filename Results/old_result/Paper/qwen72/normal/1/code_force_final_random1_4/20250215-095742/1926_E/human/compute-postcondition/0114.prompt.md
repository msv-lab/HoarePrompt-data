Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `k` retain their initial values (positive integers between 1 and 50,000), `_` remains a placeholder, `s` equals `k` or the sum of the series of `(d + 1) // 2` until `s >= k` or `d <= 0`, `i` is the number of iterations it took to reach this condition, `d` is the remaining value after subtracting `(d + 1) // 2` from `n` multiple times, `h` is still equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and `f` and `y` retain their initial values or conditions.
Code of the loop:
while p <= i - 1:
    g += (h + 1) // 2
    h -= (h + 1) // 2
    p += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `k` retain their initial values (positive integers between 1 and 50,000), `_` remains a placeholder, `s` equals `k` or the sum of the series of `(d + 1) // 2` until `s >= k` or `d <= 0`, `i` is at least 2, `d` is the remaining value after subtracting `(d + 1) // 2` from `n` multiple times, `h` is now `h - (h + 1) // 2`, `p` is 2, `g` is now `(n + 1) // 2`, and `f` and `y` retain their initial values or conditions.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` and `k` retain their initial values (positive integers between 1 and 50,000), `_` remains a placeholder, `s` equals `k` or the sum of the series of `(d + 1) // 2` until `s >= k` or `d <= 0`, `i` is at least 3, `d` is the remaining value after subtracting `(d + 1) // 2` from `n` multiple times, `h` is now `h - (h + 1) // 2`, `p` is 3, `g` is now `(n + 1) // 2 + (h - (h + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2`, and `f` and `y` retain their initial values or conditions.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` and `k` retain their initial values (positive integers between 1 and 50,000), `_` remains a placeholder, `s` equals `k` or the sum of the series of `(d + 1) // 2` until `s >= k` or `d <= 0`, `i` is at least 3, `d` is the remaining value after subtracting `(d + 1) // 2` from `n` multiple times, `h` is now `h - (h + 1) // 2 - (h + 1) // 2`, `p` is 4, `g` is now `(n + 1) // 2 + (h - (h + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2 + (h + 1) // 2`, and `f` and `y` retain their initial values or conditions.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
