Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `numTest` is equal to `t`, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `i` is 0, `opNum` is `a[n-3]`, `a[0]` through `a[n-3]` are 0, `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`, `stop` is True, if `stop` is True, at least one `a[i]` (where 0 <= i < n-2) is less than 0, and the program skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop, if `a[len(a) - 1]` is not 0 or `a[len(a) - 2]` is not 0, the program continues with the next statements in the loop, otherwise, if `a[len(a) - 1]` is 0 and `a[len(a) - 2]` is 0, the program also continues with the next statements in the loop. Additionally, the current value of `a[i]` is less than 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
