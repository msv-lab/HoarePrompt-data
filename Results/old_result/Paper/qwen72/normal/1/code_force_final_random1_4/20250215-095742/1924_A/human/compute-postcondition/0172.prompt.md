You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. The string s is of length m and consists only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt = 0
        
        cur = 0
        
        ans = ''
        
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
                ans += ss
        
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                    break
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `i` is `t` (which is 0), `n`, `k`, and `m` are the last input integers for the final test case, `s` is the last input string for the final test case, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` across all test cases, `ans` is the final concatenated string for the last test case, and `cur` is the final bitmask representing the characters seen in the last sequence of the last test case. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n` for the last test case, `ans` contains the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is extended by the character `tmp` followed by `(n - cnt - 1)` 'a' characters, and `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It returns a result for each test case based on the given parameters and the string `s`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
