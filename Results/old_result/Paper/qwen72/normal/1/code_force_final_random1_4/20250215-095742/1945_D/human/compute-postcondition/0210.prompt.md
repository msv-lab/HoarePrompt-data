Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. x is an input integer. custos is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    custo = 0
    num_fila = 0
    max_p = 0
    a_values = []
    b_values = []
    nf = input().split()
    num_fila = int(nf[0])
    max_p = int(nf[1])
    a = input().split()
    b = input().split()
    for y in a:
        a_values.append(int(y))
    for y in b:
        b_values.append(int(y))
    for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
        if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:
            custo += a_values[y]
        else:
            custo += b_values[y]
    for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
        if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
            custo += b_values[y]
            if y == 1:
                custo += a_values[0]
                break
        else:
            custo += a_values[y]
            break
    custos.append(custo)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `custo` is the final value based on the loop conditions, `custos` is the list with `custo` appended to it, and the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `nf`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, and `i` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The list `custos` now contains the updated value of `custo` appended to its existing elements. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `i`, `x`, `nf`, `a`, `b`, `y`, `custo`) retain their original values and relationships as described in the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` remains a list of strings with any number of elements, `y` is `1` (or the last value it was set to before breaking out of the loop), `b` is a non-empty collection, `b_values` contains the integer values of all elements in `b` appended to its existing values, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `max_p` must be greater than 0, `custo` is appended to `custos`, and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, `nf`, `a_values`) retain their original values and relationships as described in the initial state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
