Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s`, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if len(idx_A) == 0:
            A.append(0)
        else:
            x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
            A.append(x)
        idx_A.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `s[0]` is '>', then `idx_A` is a list containing `[0]` if it was initially empty, otherwise `idx_A` is a list containing one more element than before, which is `0`. If `idx_A` was initially empty, then `A` is a list containing `[0]` and `idx_A` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `A` is a list containing one element which is `(0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, and `idx_A` is not an empty list. If `s[0]` is not '>', then `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged from the previous iteration. If `s[1]` is '>', `idx_A` now includes the value 1 appended to it, and if `len(idx_A) == 0`, `A` is updated to include an additional element `0` at the end. Otherwise, `A` is updated with `x` appended to it. If `s[1]` is not '>', `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged from the previous iteration. If `s[2] == '>'`, `idx_A` is updated to include the value 2, and if `len(idx_A) == 0`, `A` is now a list with an additional element 0 appended. Otherwise, `A` is updated to include the new value `x` which is `A_last + (2 - idx_A_last) * len(idx_A)`, and `x` is now equal to `A_last + (2 - idx_A_last) * len(idx_A)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
