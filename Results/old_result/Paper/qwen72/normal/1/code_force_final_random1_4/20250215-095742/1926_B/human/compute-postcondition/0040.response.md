Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10.
- The grid is an `n x n` grid of characters, each being '0' or '1'.
- The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1.
- `a` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `b` is the last input string read by the loop.
- `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in each input string that contained at least one '1'.
- The length of `k` is equal to the number of input strings that contained at least one '1'.
- The first two elements of `k` are equal (`k[0] == k[1]`).

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('SQUARE')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'SQUARE'`.
- The conditions provided do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the output is hardcoded as the string `'SQUARE'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **SQUARE**
