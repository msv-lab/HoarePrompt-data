Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `i` was initially `n - 2`, `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `s[i] == '<'`, `idx_B` contains `[n - 2, n - 3]`. If `len(idx_B) == 0`, then `B` is `[0, 0]` and `idx_B` is an empty list. Otherwise, `B` is `[0, 0]` and `idx_B` contains `[n - 2, n - 3]`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `i` (which is `n - 3`) to the list `idx_B`. Since `idx_B` already contained `[n - 2]` before the code execution, after appending `i`, `idx_B` now contains `[n - 2, n - 3]`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
