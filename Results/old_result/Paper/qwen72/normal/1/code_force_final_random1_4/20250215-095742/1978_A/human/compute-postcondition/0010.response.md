Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the new input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new integer input provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `_`, and `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n` while maintaining the initial conditions for the other variables.
