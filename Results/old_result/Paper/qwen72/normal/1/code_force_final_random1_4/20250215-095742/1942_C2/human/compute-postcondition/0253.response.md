Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, `next_elem` is `a[3]` if `i` is `x - 1` otherwise `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[2] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `even` contains the value of `gap`, and `odd` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `even` remains unchanged and `odd` may contain `gap` if `gap` is greater than 1 and odd.***
