Output State: **`i` is 0, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is equal to the first element of `feat`, `f` is equal to the second element of `feat`.** 

The variable `f` is now assigned the value of the second element in the list `feat`. All other variables remain unchanged.
