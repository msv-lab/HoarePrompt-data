The code snippet `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` reverses the string `arr` and finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string. This index is then assigned to `y`. Since the string is reversed, the index found is relative to the reversed string, which means it corresponds to the position of the last occurrence of '1' in the original string `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from its previous value)
- `n` is an input integer
- `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found
- `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found
- `z` is the substring of the new `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`

After executing the code snippet:
- `y` is updated to the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the original `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from its previous value), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of the new `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.**
