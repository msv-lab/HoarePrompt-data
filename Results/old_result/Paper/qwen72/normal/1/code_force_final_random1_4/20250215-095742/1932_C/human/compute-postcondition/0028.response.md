The code snippet `ans.append(p)` adds the value of `p` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` was initially an empty list, after executing this code, `ans` will contain one element which is the value of `p`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is `n-1`, `b` is a non-empty list containing all elements from `a` in an order determined by the characters in `s`, `l` is `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', otherwise `l` is less than `n`, `r` is `-1` if all characters in `s` are 'R', otherwise `r` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `p`, `p` is `p * v % m`.**
