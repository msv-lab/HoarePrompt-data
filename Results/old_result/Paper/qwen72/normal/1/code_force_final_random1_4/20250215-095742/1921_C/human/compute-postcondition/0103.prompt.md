Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `test_cases` remains unchanged, `feat` is a list of integers derived from the input, `n` is equal to the first element of `feat`, `f` is equal to the second element of `feat`, `a` is equal to the third element of `feat`, `b` is equal to the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `array2` is an empty list, all other variables (`t`) remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `array2` and `f` remain as described.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if i == 0:
        if arr[0] < b / a:
            array2.append(arr[0] * a)
    elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
        array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0 and the first element of `arr` is less than `b / a`, `array2` contains the value `arr[0] * a`. If `i` is 0 and the first element of `arr` is not less than `b / a`, `array2` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `n` is greater than 0, and the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` has a new element which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. If `i` is not 0 and the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is not less than `b / a`, `array2` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, `array2` has a new element which is `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. Otherwise, if `i` is 1, `array2` has a new element which is `arr[0] * a`. If the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is not less than `b / a`, `array2` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and the state of `array2` and the conditions related to the elements of `arr` and the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `i == 0`, which is not the case here, `array2` would contain the value `arr[0] * a` if `arr[0] < b / a`. Since `i` is 2, `array2` has a new element `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a` if `arr[2] - arr[1] < b / a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
