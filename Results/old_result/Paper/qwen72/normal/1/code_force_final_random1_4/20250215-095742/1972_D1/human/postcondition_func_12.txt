The function `func_13` takes two integers `a` and `b` (where `b` is non-negative) as input and returns a tuple `(x, y, g)`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the arguments `(b, a % b)` and uses the results to compute and return a new tuple `(y, x - (a // b) * y, g)`, where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the values returned by the recursive call. The final state of the program includes the returned tuple, which represents the extended Euclidean algorithm results for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.
