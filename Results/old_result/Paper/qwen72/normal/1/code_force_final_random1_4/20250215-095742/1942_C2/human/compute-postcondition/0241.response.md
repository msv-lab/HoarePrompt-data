The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `x` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. For the loop to execute again, `x` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `x` is greater than 1, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `x` is 1, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[1]`, and `gap` is `next_elem - a[0] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` list contains `gap`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `even` contains the value of `gap`. Otherwise, `even` remains unchanged.**
