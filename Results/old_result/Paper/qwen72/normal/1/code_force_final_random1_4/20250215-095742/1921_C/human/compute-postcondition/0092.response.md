Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1. If `i` is 1 and the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, `array2` has a new element which is `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. If `i` is 1 and the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is not less than `b / a`, `array2` has a new element which is `arr[0] * a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `array2.append(arr[0] * a)` adds a new element to `array2`, which is `arr[0] * a`.
- The initial conditions about `i`, `n`, and the conditional behavior of `array2` remain unchanged, but now `array2` has an additional element, which is `arr[0] * a`.
