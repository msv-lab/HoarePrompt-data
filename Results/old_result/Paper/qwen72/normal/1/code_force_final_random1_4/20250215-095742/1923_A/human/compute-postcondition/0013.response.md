The code snippet `z = arr[x:n - y]` updates the value of `z` based on the current values of `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `n`. Let's break down the impact:

- `t` remains greater than 0 and is not affected by this code snippet.
- `n` is an input integer and is not affected by this code snippet.
- `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed and is not affected by this code snippet.
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found and is not affected by this code snippet.
- `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found and is not affected by this code snippet.
- `z` is updated to the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y`.

Given these points, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y`.**
