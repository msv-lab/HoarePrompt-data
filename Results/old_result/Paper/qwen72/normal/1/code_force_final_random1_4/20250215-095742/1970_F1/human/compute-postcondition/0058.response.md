Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `line` is a list of substrings with at least 1 substring, `ind` is 1, `grid` contains `line` as its last element, `elements` now contains a key-value pair where the key is `line[1]` and the value is `(0, 1)`. If the first element of `line` is not equal to '..': `elements` also contains a key-value pair where the key is the first element of `line` and the value is `(0, 0)`. If `line[1]` is a player, `allPlayers` now contains a key-value pair where the key is the first element of `line` and the value is `False`. If the second character of `line[1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 1, and `goal` now contains a key `1` with a value that is a list containing the tuple `(0, 0)` as its first element and the tuple `(0, 1)` as its second element. If the first element of `line` is equal to '..', the state remains unchanged. If the first character of `line[1]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0; otherwise, `tmp` is 1.***
