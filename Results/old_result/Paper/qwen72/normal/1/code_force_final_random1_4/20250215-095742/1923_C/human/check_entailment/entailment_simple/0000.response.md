Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program correctly initializes the necessary variables and reads the input values for each test case. It uses `map` and `input()` functions effectively to handle the input.

2. **Prefix Sum and Count Arrays**: The program constructs prefix sum (`p`) and count of ones (`c`) arrays efficiently. This allows for quick computation of the sum and count of ones within any subarray during the query phase.

3. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program calculates the sum (`s`) and count of ones (`i`) within the specified subarray using the precomputed prefix arrays. The condition `if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:` checks if the subarray is "good" based on the problem's criteria:
   - `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures the subarray has more than one element.
   - `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` ensures that the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is at least the number of ones in the subarray. This condition ensures that it is possible to construct a different array `b` with the same sum and all elements being positive and different from the corresponding elements in `a`.

4. **Output**: The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the above condition, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
