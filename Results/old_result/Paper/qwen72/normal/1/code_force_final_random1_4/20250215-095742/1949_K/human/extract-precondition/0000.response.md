Precondition: **num is a positive integer, group_a, group_b, and group_c are lists of positive integers, sum_a, sum_b, and sum_c are non-negative integers representing the sums of the elements in group_a, group_b, and group_c respectively, and na, nb, and nc are positive integers such that len(group_a) <= na, len(group_b) <= nb, and len(group_c) <= nc.**
