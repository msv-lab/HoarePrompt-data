Output State: **`ad` is a list starting with 0 and now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `a` up to the last element of `a`. The list `a` remains unchanged and starts with 0 followed by the integers from the input. The list `b` remains unchanged and starts with 0 followed by the integers from the input. The variables `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers. The variable `ql` will be the last value of `ql - a[s - 1]` computed during the final iteration. The variable `m` will be the last value of `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` computed during the final iteration. The variable `l` will be equal to `q`. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `a` minus 1. The variable `s` will be the index where the final `ql` would be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. The lists `a`, `ad`, `bd`, and `v` remain unchanged. The list `bd` is now `[0]`. The variable `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`.**
