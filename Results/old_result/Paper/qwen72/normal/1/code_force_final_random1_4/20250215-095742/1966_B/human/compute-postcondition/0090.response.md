The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from user input and assigns them to `n` and `m`, respectively. This operation overrides the initial values of `n` and `m` provided in the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 2
- `tc` is 2
- `n` is the first integer provided by the user input (initially)
- `m` is the second integer provided by the user input (initially)
- `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input from each iteration of the loop)
- `i` is `n-1`
- `j` is `m-2`
- If the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.

After executing the code:
- `n` and `m` are updated to the new values provided by the user input.
- All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `gr`, `i`, `j`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer provided by the new user input, `m` is the second integer provided by the new user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input from each iteration of the loop), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, if the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.**
