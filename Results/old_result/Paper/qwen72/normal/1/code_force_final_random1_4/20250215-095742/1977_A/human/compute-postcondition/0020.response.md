Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `m` is not equal to `n - 1`. If `m` and `n` are both even, the condition `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` holds true. Otherwise, either `m` is not even or `n` is not even, and if both `m` and `n` are odd, the condition `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0` holds true.***
