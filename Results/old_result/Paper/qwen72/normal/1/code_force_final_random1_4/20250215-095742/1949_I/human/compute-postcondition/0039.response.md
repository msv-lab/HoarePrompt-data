Postcondition: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` remains the same as the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers (potentially updated), `visited` is a list where each element is `True` if the corresponding index has been processed by the `dfs` function, `coef` is a list where elements are set to 1 if the corresponding index has been processed by the `dfs` function, `tot` is the total count of nodes processed by the `dfs` function, `bipartite` is `True` if the graph remains bipartite after processing all nodes, and `ok` is `True` if the graph is bipartite and `tot` is not 0, or if `ok` was already `True` before the final update. Additionally, the current value of `ok` is `True`.**
