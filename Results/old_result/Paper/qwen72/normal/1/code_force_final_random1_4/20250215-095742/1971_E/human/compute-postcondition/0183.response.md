Output State: **`l` is 1, `q` is greater than 1, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. If the element at index `s` in the list `a` is equal to `ql`, then the condition `a[s] == ql` holds true. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
