### Reasoning:

1. **Precomputation of Factorials**:
   - The code precomputes factorials up to 200,001 using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers. This is necessary because the problem involves counting permutations, which often requires factorial calculations.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`.
   - It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

3. **Initial Validity Check**:
   - The code checks if the last prefix maximum index is the same as the first suffix maximum index, the first prefix maximum index is 1, and the last suffix maximum index is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, the permutation is invalid, and the code prints 0.

4. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The code uses a combination function (`func_2`) to calculate the number of ways to arrange the elements between the suffix maximums.
   - It iterates over the suffix maximums and calculates the combinations for the gaps between them.

5. **Permutation Calculation**:
   - The code then iterates over the prefix maximums in reverse order and calculates the combinations for the gaps between them.
   - It also multiplies the result by the factorials of the gaps between consecutive prefix and suffix maximums.

6. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - All calculations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure the result fits within standard integer limits and to handle large numbers.

### Function Analysis:
- **`func_1(a, b)`**:
  - This function is used to compute the modular inverse of `b` under modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity.
  - The function returns a tuple `(c, d)` where `c` is the modular inverse of `b`.

- **`func_2(a, b)`**:
  - This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `b` and then multiplies it by `a` to get the final result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Overall Correctness:
- The code correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.
- The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the results are handled correctly for large numbers.
- The initial validity check ensures that the input constraints are met, and the combination and permutation calculations are performed correctly.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
