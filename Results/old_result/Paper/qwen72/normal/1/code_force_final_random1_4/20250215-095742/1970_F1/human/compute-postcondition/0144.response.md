The code snippet attempts to unpack the list `command` into three variables: `obj`, `com`, and `el`. Since `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, and assuming `command` contains exactly three elements, each of these variables will be assigned the corresponding string from the list.

Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `t` is greater than 0, `obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string in `command`, `el` is the third string in `command`.**
