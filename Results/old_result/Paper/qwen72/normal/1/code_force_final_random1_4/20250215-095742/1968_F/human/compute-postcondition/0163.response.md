Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `q` is 0, `idx` has been incremented by `2 * q_initial` (where `q_initial` is the initial value of `q`), `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, and an additional empty string. The values of `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` are no longer relevant as they are re-initialized in each iteration. The final state of `results` will depend on the specific values of `l`, `r`, `pf`, and `mp` during each iteration.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `q` is now 0, indicating that there are no more iterations left.
- The variable `idx` has been incremented by twice the initial value of `q`, reflecting the total number of elements read from `data` during the loop.
- The list `results` contains a sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' values, one for each iteration of the loop, followed by an empty string.
- The intermediate variables `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` are no longer relevant because they are re-initialized at the start of each iteration.
