You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

For each test case where `k > (n + 1) // 2`, `s` will be `k` or the sum of the series of `(d + 1) // 2` until `s >= k` or `d <= 0`, `i` will be the number of iterations it took to reach this condition, `d` will be the remaining value after subtracting `(d + 1) // 2` from `n` multiple times, `h` will be the remaining value after subtracting `(h + 1) // 2` from `h` `i-1` times, `p` will be `i`, `g` will be the sum of the series of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration, `f` will be `k - g`, and `y` will be calculated as `2



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav based on the rules provided.
   - The cards are laid down in a specific order: first the odd numbers, then the numbers that are twice an odd number, and so on.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it takes the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes several variables: `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g`.

3. **Key Logic:**
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the program directly prints `2 * k - 1`. This is because the first `(n + 1) // 2` cards laid down are the odd numbers.
   - If `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, the program enters a loop to calculate the position of the k-th card among the non-odd numbers.

4. **Detailed Breakdown:**
   - **Odd Numbers:**
     - The first `(n + 1) // 2` cards are the odd numbers. If `k` is within this range, the k-th card is `2 * k - 1`.
   - **Non-Odd Numbers:**
     - For `k` greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, the program calculates the position of the k-th card among the non-odd numbers.
     - It uses a loop to count the number of cards laid down in each subsequent group (twice an odd number, three times an odd number, etc.).
     - The variable `s` keeps track of the total number of cards laid down so far.
     - The variable `i` keeps track of the current group (1 for odd, 2 for twice an odd, etc.).
     - The variable `d` is the remaining number of cards in the current group.
     - The variable `h` is the remaining number of cards in the original set.
     - The variable `p` is used to count the number of groups processed.
     - The variable `g` is used to keep track of the total number of cards laid down in the previous groups.
     - The variable `f` is the position of the k-th card within the current group.
     - The variable `y` is the value of the k-th card.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the first `(n + 1) // 2` cards as odd numbers.
   - The logic for calculating the position of the k-th card among the non-odd numbers is also correct.
   - The program correctly outputs the k-th card for the given test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the test cases. The logic and implementation align with the requirements of the problem.
