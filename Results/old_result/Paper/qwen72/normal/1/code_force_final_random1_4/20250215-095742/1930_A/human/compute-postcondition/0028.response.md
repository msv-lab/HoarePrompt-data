The code snippet sets `score` to 0. This overrides the previous value of `score`, which was the sum of every second element starting from the first element up to the (2 * n - 2)-th element of the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `score` is 0, `i` is 2 * n - 2.**
