Output State: **`array2` contains all the elements `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` where `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a`. `i` is `n`. `n` is `feat[0]`. `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4. `feat` is a list of integers from the new input. `f` is `feat[1]`. `a` is `feat[2]`. `b` is `feat[-1]`. `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `feat[0]`.
- All other variables (`array2`, `i`, `test_cases`, `feat`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state specifies that `n` was already set to `feat[0]`, so this assignment does not change the value of `n`.
- The output state reflects the same conditions as the initial state, with the explicit confirmation that `n` is now `feat[0]`.
