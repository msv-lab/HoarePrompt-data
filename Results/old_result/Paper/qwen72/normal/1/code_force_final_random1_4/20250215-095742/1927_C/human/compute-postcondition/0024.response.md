Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer ≥ 1, `m` is an input integer ≥ 1, `k` is an input integer ≥ 1, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1 and remains 1, while `bOnes` remains 0. If `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`, then `aOnes` remains 0. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
