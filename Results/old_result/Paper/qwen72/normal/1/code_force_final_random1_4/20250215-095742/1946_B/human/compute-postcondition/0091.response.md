The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `n + 1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be at least 0, meaning `n + 1` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n + 1` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 0, and all other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, `suf`) retain their initial values and conditions. If `suf[2] - smin[2]` is greater than `sm` or `sm` is `-111`, then `sm` is updated to `suf[2] - smin[2]`. Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged.**
