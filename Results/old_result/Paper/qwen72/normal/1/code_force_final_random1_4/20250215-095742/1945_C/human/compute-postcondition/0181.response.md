The code `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is 2, the value `i + 1` is 3. Therefore, the list `lst` will now contain the elements `[2, 3]`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `lst` is `[2, 3]` if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both at least 50, otherwise `lst` is `[1, 3]`, `mini` is 100000000, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `ele`, `final` remain unchanged, `zero` is 1 or 0 depending on whether `s[0]` is '0' or '1', `one` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[0]` is '0' or '1', `zero_perc` is 50 if `s[0]` is '0' or 0 if `s[0]` is '1'.**
