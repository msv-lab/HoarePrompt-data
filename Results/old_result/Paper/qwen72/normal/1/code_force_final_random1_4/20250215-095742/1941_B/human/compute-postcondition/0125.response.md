The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving an array of integers. The function does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the problem description, it implicitly accepts the following:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer representing the number of elements in the array, with the constraint 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
  - `a`: An array of `n` integers, where each element `a_j` satisfies 0 <= a_j <= 10^9.

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. However, the specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information. Assuming the function returns a result for each test case, the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves an array `a` of `n` integers. It returns a result for each test case, with the results aggregated into a single output.**
