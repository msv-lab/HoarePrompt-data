The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the number 1. The initial state provides additional context about the variables `i`, `n_cases`, and `n`, but these variables do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

- `i` is 0.
- `n_cases` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer, and its current value is 1.

However, the `print` statement only prints the number 1, which is a constant value and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **1**
