Postcondition: ***`smin` is a list containing three elements. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, the third element of `smin` is updated to `suf[i + 1]`. Otherwise, the third element of `smin` remains `smin[i]`. `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`. All other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `suf`, and `sm`) retain their initial values and conditions as described in the precondition.***
