The code snippet `smin.append(suf[i + 1])` appends the value of `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Given the initial state:

- `smin` is a list containing a single element 0.
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `j` is 1.
- `b` is a list of strings from the new input.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`.
- `l` is a list of integers from the new input.
- `suf` is now a list containing `n + 1` elements starting with 0 and followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `i` is 0.
- `sm` is updated based on certain conditions.
- The current value of `suf[i + 1]` is less than the current value of `smin[i]`.

After executing the code snippet:

- `smin` will now contain two elements: 0 and `suf[1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`smin` is a list containing [0, `suf[1]`], `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 1, `b` is a list of strings from the new input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the new input, `suf` is now a list containing `n + 1` elements starting with 0 and followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `i` is 0, `sm` is updated based on certain conditions.**
