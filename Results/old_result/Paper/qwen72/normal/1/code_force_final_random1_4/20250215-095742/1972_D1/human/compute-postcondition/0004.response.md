The only object in the loop head is the result of the function call `func_10()`. For the loop to execute one more time, the function `func_10()` must return a positive integer that is greater than the number of iterations already completed.

At the end of the last iteration, the return value of `func_10()` was a positive integer, and the loop body did not modify any variables. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the function `func_10()` must still return a positive integer, and the loop counter (which is not explicitly named but is managed internally by the `range` function) must be incremented by 1.

Since the loop counter is not directly accessible, we focus on the condition that `func_10()` must return a positive integer for the loop to continue. The internal state of `func_10()` or any external factors affecting its return value are not specified, so we assume it continues to return a positive integer as required.

State: **The return value of `func_15()` is printed to the standard output, and no variables are modified. The condition that `func_10()` must return a positive integer for the loop to execute remains unchanged.**
