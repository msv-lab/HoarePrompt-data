Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from a new input, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences in `b`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1.
- Initially, `curr` was 0 if `a[0]` was not in `b_values` or `cnt_b[a[0]]` was less than 0, otherwise `curr` was 1.
- After executing `curr += 1`, the value of `curr` is now 1 (if it was initially 0) or 2 (if it was initially 1).
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
