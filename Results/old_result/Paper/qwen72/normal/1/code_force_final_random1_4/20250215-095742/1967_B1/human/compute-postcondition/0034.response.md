Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations, which is calculated as `n + sum(int((n // k - (k-1)) / k) + 1 for k in range(2, m + 1))`, `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop executed, `countmins` is `m`, `g` is `int(n / m) - (m - 1)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks before reaching `count = m + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `n` and `m`.
- The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, so this part remains unchanged.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, `g`) retain their initial values and conditions as specified in the initial state.
