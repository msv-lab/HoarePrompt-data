Reasoning:  
The provided solution sorts the array and then calculates the difference between the last and the first element of the sorted array. This approach does not correctly solve the problem because the beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearrangement, not just the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

To maximize the beauty of the array, one effective strategy is to sort the array in descending order and then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. However, the current implementation only considers the largest and smallest elements, which does not account for the sum of all the differences between consecutive elements.

A correct approach would involve sorting the array and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This ensures that the positive differences are maximized while the negative differences are minimized, leading to the maximum possible beauty.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
