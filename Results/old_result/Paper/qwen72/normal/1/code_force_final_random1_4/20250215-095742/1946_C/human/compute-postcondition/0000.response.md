The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. For the loop to execute, the value passed to `range` must be a positive integer, indicating the number of times the loop should run.

Given the context, the number of sets of input data is read from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()`. This value must be converted to an integer and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the number of sets of input data is a positive integer.

State: **The number of sets of input data (read from `sys.stdin.readline()` and converted to an integer) must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
