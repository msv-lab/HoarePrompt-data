Correctness: **True**

The provided solution appears to correctly address the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Counter Initialization**: It initializes a counter `nums` using `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array.
   - **MEX Calculation**: It uses a loop to simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns. The variable `start` is used to track the current MEX value being considered.
   - **Game Simulation**:
     - If the current MEX value `start` is present in the array (i.e., `nums.get(start, 0)` is greater than 0), it is added to the set `vis` and its count is decremented.
     - If the next MEX value `start + 1` is also present, its count is decremented, and `start` is incremented.
     - If `start + 1` is not present, the current MEX value `start + 1` is printed and the function returns.
   - **Final Output**: If the loop completes without finding a missing MEX value, the current `start` value is printed.

This approach ensures that the MEX value is calculated correctly by simulating the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. The logic correctly handles the constraints and edge cases described in the problem statement. Therefore, the solution is correct.
