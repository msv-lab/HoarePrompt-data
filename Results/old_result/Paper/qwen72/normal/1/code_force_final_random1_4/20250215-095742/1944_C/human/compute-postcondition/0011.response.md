Output State: **The program does not return any value.** 

Explanation: The provided code snippet ends with a `return` statement without specifying any value to return. In Python, if a function reaches a `return` statement without a value, it implicitly returns `None`. However, since no explicit value or variable is mentioned to be returned, the program simply ends execution without returning anything specific.
