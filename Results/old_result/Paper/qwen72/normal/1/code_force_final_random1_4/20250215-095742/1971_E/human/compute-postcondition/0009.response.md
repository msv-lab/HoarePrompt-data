Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input and `len(a)` must be greater than 1, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input, `ad` is a list containing the integers 0 and `a[1] - a[0]`, `bd` is a list containing only the integer 0, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value `a[1] - a[0]` to the list `ad`.
- Initially, `ad` contains only the integer 0.
- After executing the code, `ad` now contains the integers 0 and `a[1] - a[0]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
