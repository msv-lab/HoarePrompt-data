Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `word` is 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'**.

Explanation: The variable `word` was initially an empty string. After executing the code, `word` is updated to the string formed by concatenating 'a', the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` list, and 'z'. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
