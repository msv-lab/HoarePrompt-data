- `l` is a map object containing integers from the input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 2 elements.
- `j` is 1 and is an odd number.
- `test` is True.
- The difference between the second element and the first element of `lis` is greater than 1.

The print statement is:
