Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the print statement.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `res` is the last input string.
- `k` is 1.
- `best` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<` if any input was `<`, otherwise `best` remains 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down the values that will be printed:

- `'?'`: This is a literal string.
- `0`: This is a literal integer.
- `k`: The value of `k` is 1.
- `0`: This is another literal integer.
- `i`: The value of `i` is `n-1`.

Given that `n` must be greater than 2, `i` will be `n-1`, which is a positive integer.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
```
?, 0, 1, 0, n-1
```

Output: **?, 0, 1, 0, n-1 (where n is an integer greater than 2)**
