Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
- `i` is 0.
- The input provided must be a positive integer greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split by space.
- Both `a` and `b` are even numbers.

Given this information, the `print('yes')` statement will always print the string 'yes', regardless of the values of `a` and `b` as long as they meet the conditions specified (i.e., they are even numbers).

Output: **yes**
