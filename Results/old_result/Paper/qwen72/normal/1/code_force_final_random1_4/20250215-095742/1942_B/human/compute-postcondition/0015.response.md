To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 0 (this variable is not used in the loop head, so it can be ignored).
- `n` is equal to `t`.
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 1 element.
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where:
  - The last element is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]`.
  - The element at index `len(ar) - 2` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`.
  - All other elements are `None`.
- If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `t - ar[len(ar) - 1] - ar[len(ar) - 2]` and `i` remains `len(ar) - 2`.
- Otherwise, the values of `mex` and `i` remain unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the list `ar` from `len(ar) - 1` to `0` (inclusive) in reverse order.
- The loop variable `i` is adjusted by the loop itself, decrementing by 1 each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `len(ar) - 2`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, making it `len(ar) - 3`.

### Updated State:
- `t` remains the same.
- `_` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `ar` remains the same.
- `res` remains the same.
- `i` is now `len(ar) - 3`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where the last element is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]` and the element at index `len(ar) - 2` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, all other elements are `None`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `t - ar[len(ar) - 1] - ar[len(ar) - 2]` and `i` is `len(ar) - 3`. Otherwise, the values of `mex` and `i` remain unchanged.**
