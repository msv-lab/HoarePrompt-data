Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, and `b` is a list of length `n + 1`. `xx` is a list containing one string, which is the user input string `x`, and `x` is the user input string, `j` is 2. If the character at index 1 of `x` (i.e., `x[1]`) is 'F', the element at index 2 of `a` is incremented by 1. If the character at index 1 of `x` is 'S', the element at index 2 of `b` is incremented by 1. If the character at index 1 of `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged as per their initial conditions. Additionally, if the character at index 0 of `x` is 'F', the element at index 1 of `a` is incremented by 1 and the element at index 2 of `a` is incremented by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', the element at index 2 of `b` is incremented by 4. If the character at index 0 of `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged as per their initial conditions.***
