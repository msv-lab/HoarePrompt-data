Output State: **_ is t-1, n is a new input integer greater than 0, l is a sorted list of integers from user input, score is the sum of every second element in l starting from index 0 up to the last even index less than 2 * n, i is 2 * n - 2.**

### Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `_` will have reached the value `t-1`, which means the loop has run `t` times as specified by the initial number of test cases. For each iteration, the following changes occur:

1. **n**: A new input integer greater than 0 is read for each test case.
2. **l**: A sorted list of integers from user input is created for each test case.
3. **score**: The score is calculated as the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from the first element (index 0) up to the last even index less than `2 * n`.
4. **i**: The loop variable `i` reaches `2 * n - 2` after the inner loop completes, which is the last even index in the list `l`.

All other variables and conditions that were part of the initial state but not modified within the loop remain unchanged.
