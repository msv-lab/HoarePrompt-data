To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `ans` step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `count` is `m + 1`.
- `ans` is the final value after all iterations, calculated as:
  \[
  \text{ans} = n + \sum_{k=2}^{m+1} \left( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} - (k-1) \right\rfloor / k + 1 \right)
  \]
- `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop executed.
- `countmins` is `m`.
- `g` is `int(n / m) - (m - 1)`.
- If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks before reaching `count = m + 1`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `ans` starts with the value of `n`.

2. **Summation**:
   - For each `k` from 2 to `m + 1`, the term inside the summation is:
     \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} - (k-1) \right\rfloor / k + 1
     \]
   - This term is added to `ans`.

3. **Loop Break Condition**:
   - The loop will break if `g` (which is `int(n / m) - (m - 1)`) is less than `countmins` (which is `m`).

### Final Value of `ans`:
- The final value of `ans` is the sum of `n` and the summation described above, but it may be truncated if the loop breaks early due to the condition on `g`.

### Output:
- The `print(int(ans))` statement will print the integer value of `ans`.

Given the complexity of the summation and the potential loop break, the exact numerical value of `ans` cannot be determined without specific values for `n` and `m`. However, the output will be the integer value of `ans` as calculated based on the provided formula and conditions.

Output: **int(ans) (where ans is the final value after all iterations, calculated as n + sum(int((n // k - (k-1)) / k) + 1 for k in range(2, m + 1)), and the loop may break if g < countmins)**
