To determine what will be printed by the `print(final[0])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`.
   - `ele` is the last element processed from `lst`.
   - `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini`, and it is sorted in ascending order.
   - If the length of `final` is 0, the list remains empty.
   - If the length of `final` is 1:
     - If `c1` (which is equal to `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, the first element of `final` is 0.
     - Otherwise, the first element of `final` is `n`.

2. **Key Variables:**
   - `c1 = o * 100 // n`: This is a percentage calculation.
   - `n`: An integer value.
   - `o`: Another integer value.
   - `final`: A list that may be modified based on the conditions.

3. **Conditions for `final`:**
   - If `len(final) == 0`, `final` is empty.
   - If `len(final) == 1`:
     - Check the value of `c1`.
     - If `c1 >= 50`, set `final[0]` to 0.
     - Otherwise, set `final[0]` to `n`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the possible scenarios:

- **Scenario 1: `len(final) == 0`**
  - In this case, `final` is empty, and attempting to access `final[0]` would result in an `IndexError`. However, since the precondition states that `final` will be sorted and contains elements, this scenario is not applicable.

- **Scenario 2: `len(final) == 1`**
  - Here, `final` contains exactly one element.
  - We need to check the value of `c1`:
    - If `c1 >= 50`, then `final[0]` is set to 0.
    - If `c1 < 50`, then `final[0]` is set to `n`.

- **Scenario 3: `len(final) > 1`**
  - In this case, `final` contains more than one element, and `final[0]` will be the first element of the sorted list.

Since the precondition specifically mentions that if `len(final) == 1`, the value of `final[0]` is determined by the value of `c1`, we can conclude:

- If `c1 >= 50`, `final[0]` will be 0.
- If `c1 < 50`, `final[0]` will be `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **0 (if c1 >= 50) or n (if c1 < 50)**

This means the printed value will be either 0 or `n`, depending on the value of `c1`.
