Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is greater than 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d1[2]` is 1, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, and `d2[n-1]` is 1**

Explanation:
- The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `x` and `y`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `l`, `m`, `d1`, `j`, `d2`) remain unchanged.
- The new values of `x` and `y` are the integers provided by the user.
