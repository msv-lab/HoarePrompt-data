Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. The variable `ele` is the last element of `lst` that was processed in the loop. The list `final` contains all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`, and `final` is now sorted in ascending order. If `len(final) == 0`, the length of `final` is 1. If `c1` (which is equal to `(o * 100) // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, the first element of `final` is 0. If `c1` is less than 50, the first element of `final` is `n`. All other variables (`s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged. `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. `s` is the string provided by the user input. `pk` is now equal to `n / 2`.**
