Initial State: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1.

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. The variable `i` is explicitly given as 1.
2. The variable `n` is described as being greater than 1. Since `n` is not given an explicit value, it can be any integer greater than 1.
3. The `print` statement calculates `n - i` and prints this value.
4. The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than 1, so `n` can be any integer greater than 1.

The expression `n - i` simplifies to `n - 1`.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the value of `n - 1` followed by a space.

Output: **n - 1 (where n is an integer greater than 1) **
