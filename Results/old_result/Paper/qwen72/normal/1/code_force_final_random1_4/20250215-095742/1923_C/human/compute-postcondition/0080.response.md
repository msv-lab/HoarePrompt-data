Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `i` is calculated as the difference between the element at index `b` in the list `c` and the element at index `a - 1` in the same list. The values of `m`, `_`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
