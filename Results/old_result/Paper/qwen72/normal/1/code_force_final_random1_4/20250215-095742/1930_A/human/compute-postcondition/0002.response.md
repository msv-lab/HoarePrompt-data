The code snippet `l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and then sorts the resulting list of integers in ascending order. The sorted list is stored in the variable `l`.

- The initial state specifies that `_` is 0 and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. However, the code does not modify these variables, so their values remain unchanged.
- The new variable `l` is created and holds a sorted list of integers derived from the user's input.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input.**
