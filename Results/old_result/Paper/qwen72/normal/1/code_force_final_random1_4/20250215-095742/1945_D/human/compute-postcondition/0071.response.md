Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 1, `pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `total` is `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is 10^12, `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and the cost to change `a` at index `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the cost to pass `b` at index `v` (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`).**
