Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1441, `s` is a new user-provided string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", and `h` is the substring of the new `s` from index 0 to 1 (inclusive), which is the first two characters of `s`. If `int(h) <= 12`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not hold, but the values of `t`, `s`, and `h` remain unchanged.***
