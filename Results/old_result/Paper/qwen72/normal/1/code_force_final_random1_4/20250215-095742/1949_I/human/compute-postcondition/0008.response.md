The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x[0]` is an input integer, `y[0]` is an input integer, `r[0]` is an input integer, `x[1:n]` are `None`, `y[1:n]` are `None`, `r[1:n]` are `None`, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`.**
