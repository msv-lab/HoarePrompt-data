Output State: **The program returns the result of `func_3(1, l)`.** 

Here, `l` is the result of calling the function `func_3` with arguments `1` and `l`. The exact value of `l` depends on the implementation of `func_3`, which is not provided. However, the program explicitly returns whatever `func_3(1, l)` evaluates to.
