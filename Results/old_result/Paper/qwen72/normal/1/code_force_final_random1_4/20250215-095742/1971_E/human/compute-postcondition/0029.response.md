Output State: **`t` remains an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an input integer, `k` remains an input integer, `q` remains an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `b` remains a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `ad` remains a list containing the integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` remains a list containing the integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `v` is a list containing the elements [0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]].**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged as they were initially.
- The list `a` starts with 0 and contains a sequence of integers read from the input, and it must have at least 2 elements.
- The list `b` starts with 0 and contains a sequence of integers read from the input, and it must have at least as many elements as `a`.
- The list `ad` contains the integer 0 followed by the differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
- The list `bd` contains the integer 0 followed by the differences between consecutive elements of `b`.
- The variable `i` is now equal to `len(a) - 1`, which is the last index of the list `a` (excluding the initial 0).
- The list `v` starts with 0 and then contains the results of dividing each corresponding element in `ad` by the corresponding element in `bd` for all indices from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
