Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `L` is an empty list, `tot` remains unchanged, `pow` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `tot`, `pow`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
