Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from the input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); for each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`; `R` is a function that reads a line of input and returns an iterator of integers.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, x, y = R()
    sx = 0
    l = list(R())
    l.sort()
    l.append(n + l[0])
    val = []
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
        if c == 1:
            sx += 1
        val.append(c)
    val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
    for i in val:
        c = i // 2
        if y < c:
            sx += y * 2
            break
        sx += i
        y -= c
    cons = x + sx - 2
    cons = min(n - 2, cons)
    print(cons)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains an integer read from the input (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1), `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `sx` is the count of gaps between consecutive elements in `l` that are exactly 1 plus the sum of all elements in `val` that were processed before `y` became less than `c` or the loop ended, `l` is a sorted list containing `x + 1` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with the last element being `n + l[0]`, `val` is a sorted list of `x` elements where even numbers come before odd numbers and within each group, the numbers are sorted in ascending order, `i` is the last element of `val` that was processed, `c` is the last value of `i // 2` that was calculated, `y` is the remaining value after subtracting the sum of `i // 2` for all processed elements in `val`, `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `x` has been fully processed, `i` is equal to the last element in `val`, `c` is equal to the last element in `val` divided by 2, `val` is sorted such that all odd numbers come before even numbers, and within each group, the numbers are sorted in ascending order, `y` is now `y - (sum of (each element in val // 2))`, `sx` is now `sx + (sum of all elements in val) - (last element in val) + (y * 2) if y < c at the last iteration, otherwise just the sum of all elements in val), `cons` is `min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: After the loop has executed all iterations, `val` remains sorted with odd numbers before even numbers, and within each group, numbers are sorted in ascending order. The variable `i` will have iterated through all elements of `val`. The variable `c` will be the integer part of the last `i` divided by 2. The variable `y` will be updated to its initial value minus the sum of the integer parts of each `i` in `val` divided by 2. The variable `sx` will be the sum of all elements in `val` plus any additional updates due to the condition `y < c`, which adds `y * 2` to `sx` and breaks the loop if this condition is met. If the loop completes without breaking, `sx` will be the sum of all elements in `val`. The values of `n`, `t`, `y`, `l`, and `sx` remain unchanged. The variable `cons` is now equal to the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
