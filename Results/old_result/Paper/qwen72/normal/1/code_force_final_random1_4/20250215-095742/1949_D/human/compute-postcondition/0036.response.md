Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index 2 is incremented by 1, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by 2 if the corresponding character in `x` at index `j - 1` is 'S', otherwise it remains unchanged, `xx` is a list containing one string, which is the user input string `x`, `x` is the user input string, `j` is 1, and the character at index 0 of `x` is 'F'.**
