Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `t` is greater than 0, `time` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is (`pos[0] + mov[com][0]`, `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`), `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.** 

Explanation: The variable `player` is assigned the value of `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`. Otherwise, `player` is assigned the value of `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
