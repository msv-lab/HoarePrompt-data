The code snippet `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 2
- `_` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `a` is a new list of integers input by the user
- `x` is a new list of integers input by the user

After executing the code snippet, the variable `x` is updated to a new list of integers provided by the user.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `x` is a new list of integers input by the user.**
