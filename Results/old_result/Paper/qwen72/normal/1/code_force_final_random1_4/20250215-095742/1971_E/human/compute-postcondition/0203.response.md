Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, and `v` remain unchanged for each test case. `l` is 0, `m` is the final calculated value based on the last `ql` input, `i` is 1, `ql` is the last input value minus the appropriate `a[s - 1]`, and `s` is the index where the last `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain sorted order.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable is decremented implicitly as the loop runs `t` times. After all iterations, `t` is 0.
- **`n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`**: These variables remain unchanged because they are initialized once per test case and are not modified within the loop.
- **`l`**: This variable is used to iterate over the queries. After all iterations, `l` is 0.
- **`m`**: This variable holds the final calculated value based on the last `ql` input. It is updated in each iteration of the inner loop.
- **`i`**: This variable is set to 1 at the start of each test case and remains 1 throughout the loop.
- **`ql`**: This variable holds the last input value minus the appropriate `a[s - 1]` from the last iteration.
- **`s`**: This variable holds the index where the last `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. It is determined using `bisect_left(a, ql)`.
