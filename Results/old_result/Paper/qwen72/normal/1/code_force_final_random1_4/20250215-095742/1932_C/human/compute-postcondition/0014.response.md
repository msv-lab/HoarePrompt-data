Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `i` is 1, `b` now contains the element `a[r]` appended to it.** 

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `r` of list `a` to the list `b`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The new state reflects that `b` has been updated with the element from `a[r]`.
