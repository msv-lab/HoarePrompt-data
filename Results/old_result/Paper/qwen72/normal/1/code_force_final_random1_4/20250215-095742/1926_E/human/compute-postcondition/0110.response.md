To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `p <= i - 1`.

### Current State:
- `p` is 3
- `i` is at least 3

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `p <= i - 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`.

Given the current state:
- `p` is 3.
- `i` is at least 3, so `i - 1` is at least 2.

Since `p` is 3 and `i - 1` is at least 2, the condition `p <= i - 1` is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

### Conclusion:
No changes are needed to the program state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` and `k` retain their initial values (positive integers between 1 and 50,000), `_` remains a placeholder, `s` equals `k` or the sum of the series of `(d + 1) // 2` until `s >= k` or `d <= 0`, `i` is at least 3, `d` is the remaining value after subtracting `(d + 1) // 2` from `n` multiple times, `h` is now `h - (h + 1) // 2`, `p` is 3, `g` is now `(n + 1) // 2 + (h - (h + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2`, and `f` and `y` retain their initial values or conditions.**
