You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())
        
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        
        results.append(winner)
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations that were specified initially. `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration. For each iteration, `a` and `b` are updated with new integer values from user input, and `winner` holds the result of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration. The values of `a` and `b` are the last set of integers provided by the user input, and `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)` using these last values.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where `t` is the total number of iterations specified initially. Each element in `results` is the result of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration. `a` and `b` hold the last set of integers provided by the user input, and `winner` holds the result of `func_1(a, b)` using these last values.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 1000). For each test case, `a` and `b` are positive integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
