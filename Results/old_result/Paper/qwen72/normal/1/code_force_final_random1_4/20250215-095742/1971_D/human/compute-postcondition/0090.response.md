To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a new input string with any length greater than 1.
   - `t` is greater than 2 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `i` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `j` is `len(s) - 1` (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `count` is the number of times consecutive characters in `s` are different plus 1.
   - `flag` is True if there is at least one occurrence of '0' followed by '1' in `s`.
   - If `flag` is True, `count` is the number of times consecutive characters in `s` are different, and `flag` remains True.

2. **Understanding `count`:**
   - Initially, `count` is the number of times consecutive characters in `s` are different plus 1.
   - If `flag` is True, `count` is adjusted to be the number of times consecutive characters in `s` are different (without the plus 1).

3. **Determining the Value of `count`:**
   - We need to count the number of times consecutive characters in `s` are different.
   - If `flag` is True, we subtract 1 from this count.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - Let's denote the number of times consecutive characters in `s` are different as `diff_count`.
   - If `flag` is False, `count` is `diff_count + 1`.
   - If `flag` is True, `count` is `diff_count`.

Given the initial state, the value of `count` will be:
- `diff_count + 1` if `flag` is False.
- `diff_count` if `flag` is True.

Since the exact string `s` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `count`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `count`.

Output: **count (where count is the number of times consecutive characters in `s` are different, plus 1 if `flag` is False, and without the plus 1 if `flag` is True)**
