Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions. Specifically, the algorithm does not correctly handle the scenario where the cost to move to a position `j` (where `j < i`) involves paying both `a_j` and the cumulative costs of `b_k` for all `k` such that `j < k < i`.

Here's a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
14
```

**Actual Output:**
The program outputs `14`, which is correct for this specific case. However, let's consider another case:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
10 2 5 1 8
1 3 4 2 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
12
```

**Actual Output:**
The program might output a different value because it does not correctly account for the cumulative costs of moving through intermediate positions.

In the second case, the optimal path for Kirill to move from position 5 to position 3 would involve:
1. Moving from position 5 to position 4, paying `b_4 = 2`.
2. Moving from position 4 to position 3, paying `a_3 = 5` and `b_3 = 4`.

The total cost would be `2 + 5 + 4 = 11`, but the program might not correctly compute this due to its flawed logic in handling the cumulative costs.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
