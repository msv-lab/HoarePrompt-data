Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1n} and a_{21} a_{22} ... a_{2n} are binary strings of length n, where each character is either '0' or '1'.**
