The code snippet calculates the percentage of times the variable `zero` has been incremented relative to the current value of `i + 1`. The value of `zero_perc` is determined by multiplying `zero` by 100 and then performing integer division by `i + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1
- If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `one` is increased by 1.

Let's calculate the output state:

1. `i` remains 1.
2. `n` remains an input integer greater than 1.
3. The value of `zero` is used to calculate `zero_perc`.
4. `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `zero * 100 // 2` because `i` is 1.
5. The values of `s`, `zero`, and `one` remain unchanged unless they are modified by the condition described in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `zero_perc` is `zero * 50`, if `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is increased by 1, otherwise, `one` is increased by 1.**
