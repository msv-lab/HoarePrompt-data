Output State: **The program returns True.** This indicates that the condition where all monsters have been defeated with the available bullets has been met. The `rest` variable being 0 confirms there are no bullets left, and the `pos` variable being equal to the length of `sorted_indices` means all monsters have been processed. The `a` list, containing the remaining health of each monster, consists entirely of 0s, confirming all monsters have been defeated. The `distance` variable represents the number of iterations the loop executed, which is the maximum distance at which the last monster was defeated. The variables `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged.
