Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The goal is to find the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful by ensuring it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map". However, the program simply counts the occurrences of these substrings and prints their sum. This approach is incorrect because:

1. **Counting Substrings**: Counting the occurrences of "map" and "pie" does not account for overlapping instances or the fact that removing one character can affect multiple substrings. For example, in the string "mappppie", removing the 'p' at index 3 would remove both "map" and "pie" substrings, but the program does not consider this.

2. **Minimum Deletions**: The program does not calculate the minimum number of deletions required to remove all instances of "pie" and "map". Instead, it just adds the counts of these substrings, which is not the correct approach.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the substrings overlap or where the substrings are part of longer sequences that need to be broken.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
