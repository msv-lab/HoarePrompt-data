Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to divide the books into two non-empty piles such that the sum of the pages of the highest-numbered book in each pile is maximized. This means we need to ensure that the two largest numbers in the list are in different piles.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums`.
   - The solution prints the sum of the maximum value in the list excluding the last element (`max(nums[:-1])`) and the last element of the list (`nums[-1]`).

3. **Evaluating the Logic**:
   - The logic assumes that the last element of the list (`nums[-1]`) is always one of the two largest numbers in the list.
   - However, this assumption is not always true. The last element could be any number in the list, and it might not be one of the two largest numbers.
   - For example, consider the input `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The last element is `4`, but the second-largest element is `3`. The correct answer should be `4 + 3 = 7`, but the provided solution would calculate `max([1, 2, 3]) + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7`, which is coincidentally correct in this case but not guaranteed to be correct in all cases.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the two largest numbers in the list and ensure they are in different piles.
   - The correct approach would be to sort the list and take the sum of the two largest elements.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not always find the two largest numbers in the list and place them in different piles.
   - Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

Final: **False**
