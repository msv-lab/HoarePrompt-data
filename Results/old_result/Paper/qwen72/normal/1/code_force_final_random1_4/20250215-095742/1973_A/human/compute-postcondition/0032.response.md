The only objects in the loop head are the variables `(p1, p2, p3)` and the list `cas_de_test`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `cas_de_test`. If `cas_de_test` has at least three tuples, the loop can execute again for the third tuple.

At the end of the last iteration, `cas_de_test` must have at least two tuples, `p1` is the first element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third element of the second tuple in `cas_de_test`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `cas_de_test` must have at least three tuples. The next tuple to be processed will be the third tuple in `cas_de_test`. Therefore, `p1` will be the first element of the third tuple, `p2` will be the second element of the third tuple, and `p3` will be the third element of the third tuple.

State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least three tuples. `p1` is the first element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third element of the third tuple in `cas_de_test`.**
