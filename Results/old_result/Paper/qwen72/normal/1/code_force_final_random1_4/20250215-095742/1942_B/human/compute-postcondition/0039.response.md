Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding index `i` starting from the end of the list, `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `ar` (this value is computed as the loop progresses), and `i` is -1.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the list `ar` in reverse order, updating the `res` list with the value `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i`.
- The variable `mex` starts as `n` and is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`. This ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `ar` up to the current iteration.
- After the loop completes, `res` contains the results of the computation for each element in `ar`, and `mex` holds the final value of the smallest non-negative integer not present in `ar`.
- The variable `i` ends up being -1, as the loop decrements `i` until it reaches -1, which is the condition that stops the loop.
