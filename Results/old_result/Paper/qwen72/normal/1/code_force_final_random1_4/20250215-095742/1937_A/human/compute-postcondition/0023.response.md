The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the user. The initial state specifies that `i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, and `n` is an input integer. After executing the code, the value of `n` is updated to the new input integer.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is the new input integer.**
