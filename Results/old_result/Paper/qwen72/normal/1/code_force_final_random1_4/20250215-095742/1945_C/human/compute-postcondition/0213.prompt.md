Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases. `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n % 2 == 0:
        pk = n / 2
    else:
        pk = n / 2
    sl = list(s)
    o = sl.count('1')
    z = sl.count('0')
    zero, one = 0, 0
    lst = []
    mini = pow(10, 8)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == '0':
            zero += 1
        else:
            one += 1
        zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
        one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
        if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
            lst.append(i + 1)
    for ele in lst:
        mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))
    final = []
    for elem in lst:
        if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
            final.append(elem)
    final.sort()
    if len(final) == 0:
        c1 = o * 100 // n
        if c1 >= 50:
            final.append(0)
        else:
            final.append(n)
    print(final[0])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`. If `n` is even, `pk` is set to `n / 2`; if `n` is odd, `pk` is also set to `n / 2`. `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in `sl`. `mini` is the minimum value among the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. `i` is `n - 2`. `zero` is the number of '0's encountered in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's encountered in the first `n-1` characters of `s`. `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - (n - 1) - 1)`. `lst` contains the indices (1-based) where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50. `final` is sorted in ascending order and contains all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes the value 0. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` includes the value `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. The variable `ele` is the last element of `lst` that was processed in the loop. The list `final` contains all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`, and `final` is now sorted in ascending order. If `len(final) == 0`, the length of `final` is 1. If `c1` (which is equal to `(o * 100) // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, the first element of `final` is 0. If `c1` is less than 50, the first element of `final` is `n`. All other variables (`n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *After all iterations of the loop, `mini` will be the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`. The variable `ele` will be the last element processed from `lst`. The list `final` will contain all elements from `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini`, and `final` will be sorted in ascending order. If the length of `final` is 0, the list remains empty. If the length of `final` is 1, and if `c1` (which is equal to `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, the first element of `final` is 0. Otherwise, the first element of `final` is `n`. All other variables (`s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `n`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `i`, `lst`) remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
