Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least one element, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is `arr[len(arr) - 1]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `tem` is updated to be the product of its current value (which was 1) and the last element of the list `arr` (since `i` is `len(arr) - 1`).
- The value of `i` remains `len(arr) - 1`.
- The list `arr` and the list `ans` remain unchanged.
