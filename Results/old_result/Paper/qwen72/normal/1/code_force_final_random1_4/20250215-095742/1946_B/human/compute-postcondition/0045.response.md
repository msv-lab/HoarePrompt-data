Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `suf` and the corresponding element in `l`, `i` is `n + 1`, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value of the suffix sums up to that index in `suf`, `sm` is now `suf[n] + 2`.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `sm` was 2.
- The code snippet `sm += suf[n]` adds the value of `suf[n]` to `sm`.
- Therefore, the new value of `sm` is `suf[n] + 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
