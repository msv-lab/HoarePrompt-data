The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to proceed.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `False` values except possibly `visited[0]` which may be `True`, `coef` is a list with the first element set to 1 and the rest might be updated, `tot` might be updated, `bipartite` might be `False`, `ok` is `True` if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains `False`**
