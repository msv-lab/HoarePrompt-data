Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and each string s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, n is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s = input()
    a = set(s)
    if len(a) == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        b = ''.join(sorted(s))
        c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
        if b == s:
            print(c)
        else:
            print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is an input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, and `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the string `s`. If `len(a) == 2`, then `a` contains exactly 2 unique characters. Otherwise, `a` contains a number of unique characters not equal to 2, `b` is a sorted string of `s`, and `c` is a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in descending order. If `b` (the sorted version of `s`) is equal to `s`, then `s` is already sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, `b` is not equal to `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new string `s`. If `len(a) == 2`, then `a` contains exactly 2 unique characters. Otherwise, `a` contains a number of unique characters not equal to 2, `b` is a sorted string of the new `s`, and `c` is a string containing the characters of the new `s` sorted in descending order. If `b` (the sorted version of the new `s`) is equal to the new `s`, then the new `s` is already sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, `b` is not equal to the new `s`. The conditions remain unchanged regardless of whether `len(a) == 2` or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new string `s`. If `len(a) == 2`, then `a` contains exactly 2 unique characters. Otherwise, `a` contains a number of unique characters not equal to 2, `b` is a string containing the characters of the new `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is a string containing the characters of the new `s` sorted in descending order. If `b` (the sorted version of the new `s`) is equal to the new `s`, then the new `s` is already sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, `b` is not equal to the new `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
