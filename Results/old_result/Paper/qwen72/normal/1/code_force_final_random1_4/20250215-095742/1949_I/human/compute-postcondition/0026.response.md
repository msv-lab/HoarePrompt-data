Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `False` values except possibly `visited[0]` which may be `True`, `coef` is a list with the first element set to 1 and the second element (index 1) also set to 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` might be `False`, `ok` is `True` if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains `False`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets `tot` to 0.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, `bipartite`, `ok`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- Since `tot` is now 0, the condition for `ok` being `True` (which requires `bipartite` to be `True` and `tot` to be non-zero) is not met, so `ok` remains `False` unless `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` changes later.
