Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers â‰¥ 1, `t` is `t + 2`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, and `i` remain unchanged, but the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside.
