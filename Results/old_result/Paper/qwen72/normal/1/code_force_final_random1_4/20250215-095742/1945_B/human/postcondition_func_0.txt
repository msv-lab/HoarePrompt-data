The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It calculates `mn` as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, it prints `mn // a + mn // b + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `mn // a + mn // b`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that `t` is 0, and the outputs for each test case have been printed.
