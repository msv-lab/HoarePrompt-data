Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0 (since the loop has completed its `t` iterations). For each iteration, the variables `n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `i`, `lst`, `mini`, and `final` are recalculated based on the new inputs provided for each test case. Specifically, `mini` will be the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst` for each test case. The variable `ele` will be the last element processed from `lst` for each test case. The list `final` will contain all elements from `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini`, and `final` will be sorted in ascending order for each test case. If the length of `final` is 0 for any test case, the list remains empty. If the length of `final` is 1, and if `c1` (which is equal to `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, the first element of `final` is 0. Otherwise, the first element of `final` is `n`. The final output for each test case is the first element of `final`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all `t` iterations:
- The variable `t` is 0 because the loop has run `t` times.
- For each test case, the variables `n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `i`, `lst`, `mini`, and `final` are updated based on the input for that test case.
- The list `final` for each test case contains the optimal index (or 0 or `n` if no valid index is found) that meets the criteria specified in the loop.
- The final output for each test case is the first element of `final`.
