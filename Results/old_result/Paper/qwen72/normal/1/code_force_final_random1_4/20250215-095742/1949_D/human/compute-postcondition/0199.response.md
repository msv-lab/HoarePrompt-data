To determine what will be printed by the `print(nx)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the string `nx`.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\).
- `i` is 3.
- `a` is a list of length \(n + 1\).
- `b` is a list of length \(n + 1\).
- `xx` is a list containing \(n\) strings.
- `sa` is a list containing all indices \(j\) (1 ≤ \(j\) ≤ \(n\)) where \(a[j] > 0\) and \(b[j] == 0\), plus any indices \(j\) (1 ≤ \(j\) ≤ \(n\)) where both \(a[j]\) and \(b[j]\) are 0.
- `sb` is a list containing all indices \(j\) (1 ≤ \(j\) ≤ \(n\)) where \(b[j] > 0\) and \(a[j] == 0\).
- The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.
- `j` is \(n + 1\).
- `nx` is a string constructed by iterating through each character in `xx[3]` from index 0 to \(n-1\). For each character:
  - If it is not '?', it is appended to `nx`.
  - If it is '?', and if the current index `j` (or `i` which is 3) is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4]`), 'F' is appended to `nx`.
  - Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`.

### Step-by-Step Construction of `nx`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 24.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` is \(n + 1\).

2. **String Construction**:
   - Iterate through each character in `xx[3]` from index 0 to \(n-1\).
   - For each character:
     - If the character is not '?', append it to `nx`.
     - If the character is '?':
       - Check if the current index `j` (or `i` which is 3) is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4]`).
       - If it is, append 'F' to `nx`.
       - Otherwise, append 'S' to `nx`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n = 8` for simplicity. This means:
- `a` and `b` are lists of length 9.
- `xx` is a list of 8 strings.
- `sa` and `sb` are lists of indices based on the conditions given.
- `j` is 9.

Suppose `xx[3]` is "A?B?C?D?E?F?G?H?".

- The first quarter of `sa` would be `sa[:2]` because \(8 // 4 = 2\).

Let's assume `sa` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` (for simplicity, assuming all indices are valid).

- `sa[:2]` is `[1, 2]`.

Now, construct `nx`:
- Index 0: 'A' (not '?') -> `nx = "A"`
- Index 1: '?' and `j` (or `i` which is 3) is not in `[1, 2]` -> `nx = "AS"`
- Index 2: 'B' (not '?') -> `nx = "ASB"`
- Index 3: '?' and `j` (or `i` which is 3) is not in `[1, 2]` -> `nx = "ASBS"`
- Index 4: 'C' (not '?') -> `nx = "ASBSC"`
- Index 5: '?' and `j` (or `i` which is 3) is not in `[1, 2]` -> `nx = "ASBSCS"`
- Index 6: 'D' (not '?') -> `nx = "ASBSCSD"`
- Index 7: '?' and `j` (or `i` which is 3) is not in `[1, 2]` -> `nx = "ASBSCSDS"`

Thus, the final value of `nx` is "ASBSCSDS".

### Final Output:
Output: **ASBSCSDS (where ASBSCSDS is the constructed string based on the rules described)**
