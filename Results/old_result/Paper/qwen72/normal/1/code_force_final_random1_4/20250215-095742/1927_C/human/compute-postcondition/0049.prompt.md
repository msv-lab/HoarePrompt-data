Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer ≥ 1, `m` is an input integer ≥ 1, `k` is an input integer ≥ 1, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
    elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer ≥ 1, `m` is an input integer ≥ 1, `k` is an input integer ≥ 1, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` < `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` ≥ `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, and `aOnes` ≤ `newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1 and remains 1, while `bOnes` remains 0. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, and `aOnes` > `newk`, then `aOnes` remains 0. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, and `bOnes` ≤ `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, and `bOnes` > `newk`, then `bOnes` remains 0. If `i` is not in either `a` or `b`, then `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer ≥ 1, `m` is an input integer ≥ 1, `k` is an input integer ≥ 1, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 4, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3. If `i` (which is now 4) is in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `aOnes`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is only in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is only in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer ≥ 1, `m` is an input integer ≥ 1, `k` is an input integer ≥ 1, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 5, `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain unchanged unless the conditions specified in the initial state are met.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
