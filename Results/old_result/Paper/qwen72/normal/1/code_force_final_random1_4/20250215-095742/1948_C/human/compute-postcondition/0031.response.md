Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, and the loop counter `_` remains 0. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement after the if block.***
