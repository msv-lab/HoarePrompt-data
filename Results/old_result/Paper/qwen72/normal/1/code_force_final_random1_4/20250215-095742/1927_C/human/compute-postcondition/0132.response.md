Postcondition: **`n` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `m` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `k` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `t` is `t + 2`, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, `b` is a new list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, and either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is greater than `newk`. Additionally, either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is greater than `newk`.** 

(Note: The last part of the postcondition is a restatement of the negation of the if condition, ensuring that the program did not enter the if block.)
