To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `i` is 1
  - `n` is greater than `m`
  - If `a[1 + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[1 + m]]` is decremented by 1.
  - If `a[1]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is incremented by 1.
  - If `cnt_b[a[1]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1.
  - If `cnt_b[a[1 + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is increased by 1.
  - If `a[1 + m]` is not in `b_values`, no changes are made to `cnt_b` or `curr`.
  - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n - m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `n - m`.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - m`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
- **`n` and `m`**: These values are not modified within the loop head, so they remain the same. `n` is still greater than `m`.

### Updated State:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than `m`
- The other variables (`a`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`, `curr`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than `m`**
