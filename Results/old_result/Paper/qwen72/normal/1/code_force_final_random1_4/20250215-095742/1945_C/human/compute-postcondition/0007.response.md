Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `n` is odd, `pk` is `n / 2`**

Explanation: The variable `pk` is assigned the value of `n / 2`. Since `n` is an odd integer, `pk` will be a floating-point number (as dividing an odd integer by 2 results in a non-integer value). All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
