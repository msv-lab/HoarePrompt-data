To determine what will be printed by the `print('Bob')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `l` is a map object containing integers from the input.
   - `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 4 elements.
   - `j` is 3.
   - If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, `test` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement following the if block.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('Bob')` statement is not conditional on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It is a simple print statement that will always execute and print the string 'Bob'.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the `print('Bob')` statement is not dependent on any conditions or variables that could change its behavior, it will always print 'Bob'.

Output: **Bob**
