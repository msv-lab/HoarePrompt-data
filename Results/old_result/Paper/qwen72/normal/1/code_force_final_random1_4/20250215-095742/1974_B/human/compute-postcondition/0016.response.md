Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 1, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the string `s` with `char` inserted at index `2`, `i` is 2, `j` is `len(unique_chars) + 1`, `char` is the second character in `s` if `s` has at least 2 characters.** 

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, making `j` equal to `len(unique_chars) + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
