Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `n-1` (the last index of the string `s`). The lists `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`. For each position `i` where `s[i]` is '>', `idx_A` will store the index `i`, and `A` will store the calculated value `x` as defined in the loop. If there are no '>' characters in `s`, both `A` and `idx_A` will remain empty. `B` is an empty list. `idx_B` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(0, n):
    i = n - 1 - j
    if s[i] == '<':
        if len(idx_B) == 0:
            B.append(0)
        else:
            x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
            B.append(x)
        idx_B.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `n - 1 - j`, `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0. If the character at position `i` in the string `s` is '<', `idx_B` is now a list containing the value `i`. If `idx_B` was empty before, `B` is `[0]` and `idx_B` is no longer an empty list. Otherwise, `B` is `[x]` where `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, and `idx_B` is not empty. If the character at position `i` in the string `s` is not '<', the lists `B` and `idx_B` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `n - 2`, `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `s[i] == '<'`, `idx_B` contains `[n - 2]`. If `len(idx_B) == 0`, then `B` is `[0]` and `idx_B` is an empty list. Otherwise, `B` is a list containing `x`, `idx_B` is an empty list, and an error occurs because `B` and `idx_B` are empty lists, making `len(B) - 1` and `len(idx_B) - 1` invalid indices.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n - 3`, `i` was initially `n - 2`, `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `s[i] == '<'`, `idx_B` contains `[n - 2, n - 3]`. If `len(idx_B) == 0`, then `B` is `[0, 0]` and `idx_B` is an empty list. Otherwise, `B` is `[0, 0]` and `idx_B` contains `[n - 2, n - 3]`. If `s[i] != '<'`, `idx_B` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
