Postcondition: ***`it2` is the index in `v2` where the last element less than `r` is located, or -1 if no such element exists. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1` and `it2` is non-negative, and `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r` and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to `l`, then `results` now contains one additional element, which is the string 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` now includes 'NO' as its last element. All other variables remain unchanged.***
