Reasoning:

The program aims to reconstruct a permutation `p` from the array `a` based on the given conditions. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `res` is initialized as a list of `None` values with length `n`.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Reconstruction Loop**:
   - The loop iterates from the last element of `ar` to the first element.
   - For each index `i`, the value of `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]`.
   - The `mex` value is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Output**:
   - After constructing the `res` list, it is printed as a space-separated string.

### Verification of Logic:

- **MEX Calculation**:
  - The MEX of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the sequence.
  - The program uses the formula `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` to reconstruct `p`.
  - By setting `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`, the program is effectively calculating `p_i` based on the given `a_i`.

- **Update of `mex`**:
  - The `mex` value is updated to ensure it remains the smallest non-negative integer not in the sequence.
  - The condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]` ensures that `mex` is updated correctly.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge cases where `a_i` can be negative or positive.
  - The initialization of `mex` to `n` ensures that the initial MEX is correctly set.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's walk through the first test case from the example:

- **Input**: `5\n1 1 -2 1 2`
- **Expected Output**: `0 1 4 2 3`

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n = 5`
   - `ar = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
   - `res = [None, None, None, None, None]`
   - `mex = 5`

2. **Reconstruction**:
   - `i = 4`: `res[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = 3`
   - `i = 3`: `res[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`
   - `i = 2`: `res[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = 4`
   - `i = 1`: `res[1] = 4 - 1 = 3`, but `mex` is already 2, so `mex = 2`
   - `i = 0`: `res[0] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = 1`

3. **Output**:
   - `res = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`

The program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` based on the given `a`.

### Conclusion:

The program logic is correct and follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
