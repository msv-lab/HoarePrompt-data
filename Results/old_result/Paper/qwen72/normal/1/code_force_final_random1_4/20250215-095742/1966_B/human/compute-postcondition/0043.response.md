Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the integer provided by the user input, `m` is the integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` user input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`. If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, `ans` remains 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.***
