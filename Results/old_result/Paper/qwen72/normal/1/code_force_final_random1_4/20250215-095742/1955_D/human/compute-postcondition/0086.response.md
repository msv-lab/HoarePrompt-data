Output State: **All elements in `b_values` have been processed, and for each element `i` in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0, the loop will execute one more time if the current iteration count is less than the input value. `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, converted to integers. `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`.
- The initial state conditions about `b_values`, `cnt_b`, and the loop condition remain unchanged.
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are still assigned from the input split by spaces and converted to integers.
- The new variable `a` is now a list of integers derived from the input.
