Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and processes each test case by reading the values of `x` and `y`.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - `z = (y + 1) // 2`: This calculation is correct. It determines the minimum number of screens needed to fit all 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, the formula `(y + 1) // 2` ensures that we account for the possibility of needing an extra screen if there is an odd number of 2x2 icons.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - `m = 15 * z - y * 4`: This calculation is also correct. It computes the number of remaining cells after placing all 2x2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells, and each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, so the total number of remaining cells is `15 * z - y * 4`.

4. **Adjusting for 1x1 Icons**:
   - `if m < x`: This condition checks if the remaining cells are insufficient to fit all 1x1 icons. If so, additional screens are needed. The number of additional screens required is calculated as `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`. This ensures that any remaining 1x1 icons are placed on new screens, with each screen having a maximum capacity of 15 cells.

5. **Output**:
   - The final number of screens `z` is printed for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Variable Name Confusion**: The variable `a` is used both for the number of test cases and in the calculation `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`. This is a potential source of confusion and should be avoided. However, in the context of the program, this does not affect the correctness of the logic because the variable `a` is not reused in the calculation.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < x:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)
```

### Final Verdict:
The original program is logically correct and will produce the correct output for all test cases. The only issue is the variable name `a` which, while confusing, does not impact the correctness of the program. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
