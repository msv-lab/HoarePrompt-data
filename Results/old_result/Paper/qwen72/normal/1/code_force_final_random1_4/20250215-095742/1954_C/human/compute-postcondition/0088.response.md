Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input provided by the user, `i` is 1, `new` is a list where the first element is `max(a[0], b[0])` and the rest are `None` values, `new2` is a list where the first element is `min(a[0], b[0])` and the rest are `None` values, and `a[0]` is equal to `b[0]`.** 

The value of `i` has been incremented from 0 to 1, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
