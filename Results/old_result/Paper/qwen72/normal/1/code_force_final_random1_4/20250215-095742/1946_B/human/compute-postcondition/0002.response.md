The code `b = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variable `b` now holds this list. The values of `t` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input.**
