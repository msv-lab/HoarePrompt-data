The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. This operation updates the values of these variables based on the input provided.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `x` is an input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)
- `y` is an input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x
- `tt` must be greater than 1
- `ii` is 2
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`
- `ans` is the final value of `x + y - 2` plus the sum of all increments due to the loop conditions plus the current value of `y`
- `tmp` is a list containing all the integers added during the loop execution plus the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` is updated to the first integer from the input
- `x` is updated to the second integer from the input
- `y` is updated to the third integer from the input

The other variables (`t`, `tt`, `ii`, `a`, `i`, `ans`, `tmp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is the third input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the final value of `x + y - 2` plus the sum of all increments due to the loop conditions plus the current value of `y`, `tmp` is a list containing all the integers added during the loop execution plus the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.**
