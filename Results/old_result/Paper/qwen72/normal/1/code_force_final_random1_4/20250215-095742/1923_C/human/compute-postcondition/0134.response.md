To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `l` is a list of integers from user input.
- `i` is the difference between the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `b` and the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `a-1` in `l`.
- `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`.
- `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`.
- `c` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of `1`s in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`.
- `n` and `m` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `a` and `b` are integers from user input.
- `s` is the difference between the cumulative sum at index `b` and the cumulative sum at index `a-1` in `p`.
- The length of the subarray from index `a` to `b` is greater than 1.
- The difference between `s` and the length of this subarray is greater than or equal to `i`.

### Analysis:
1. **Cumulative Count of `1`s (`c`)**:
   - `c` is a list where each element represents the cumulative count of `1`s in `l` up to that index.
   - For example, if `l = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]`, then `c = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3]`.

2. **Cumulative Sum (`p`)**:
   - `p` is a list where each element represents the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to that index.
   - For example, if `l = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]`, then `p = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3]`.

3. **Variables `a` and `b`**:
   - `a` and `b` are indices provided by the user.
   - The subarray from index `a` to `b` must have a length greater than 1.

4. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is the difference between the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `b` and the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `a-1`.
   - For example, if `a = 2` and `b = 4`, and `c = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3]`, then `i = c[4] - c[1] = 3 - 1 = 2`.

5. **Variable `s`**:
   - `s` is the difference between the cumulative sum at index `b` and the cumulative sum at index `a-1`.
   - For example, if `a = 2` and `b = 4`, and `p = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3]`, then `s = p[4] - p[1] = 3 - 1 = 2`.

6. **Condition**:
   - The length of the subarray from index `a` to `b` is greater than 1.
   - The difference between `s` and the length of this subarray is greater than or equal to `i`.

### Conclusion:
Given the conditions and the definitions of the variables, the `print('YES')` statement will always print 'YES' because the conditions provided ensure that the subarray meets the required criteria.

Output: **YES**
