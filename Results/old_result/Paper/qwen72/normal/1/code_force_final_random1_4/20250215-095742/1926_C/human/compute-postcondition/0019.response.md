Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 Â· 10^5, `N` must be greater than 2, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is the sum of the digits of the integer `1`, and `pd[2]` is now `pd[2] + pd[1] + 4`, `i` is 10, `j` is '1', `pd[10]` is now `pd[10] + 1`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `pd[i] += int(j)` increments the value of `pd[10]` by 1, since `i` is 10 and `j` is '1'. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
