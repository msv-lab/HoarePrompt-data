The code snippet updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` from its current value. Let's break down the impact:

- `i` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `r` is decreased by 1.
- `a` is assigned the value of `A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- `b` is initially `B[r] - B[r - l]`.

The new value of `b` is calculated as:
\[ \text{new\_b} = b - (\text{idx\_B}[r - l] - i) \times (r - l) \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{new\_b} = (B[r] - B[r - l]) - (\text{idx\_B}[r - l] - 2) \times (r - l) \]

Therefore, the updated value of `b` is:
\[ b = B[r] - B[r - l] - (\text{idx\_B}[r - l] - 2) \times (r - l) \]

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 2) * (r - l)`**.
