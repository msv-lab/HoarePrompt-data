To determine what will be printed by the `print('NO')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input.
- `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
- Either `(b - a + 1) <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `a` and `b` are user-provided integers.
   - `i` is the difference between the values at indices `b` and `a - 1` in the list `c`.
   - `s` is the difference between the values at indices `b` and `a - 1` in the list `p`.
   - The condition `(b - a + 1) <= 1` means that the range from `a` to `b` is either a single element or empty.
   - The condition `s - (b - a + 1) < i` means that the difference between `s` and the length of the range from `a` to `b` is less than `i`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('NO')`.
   - This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `s`, or any other variables.

Output: **NO**
