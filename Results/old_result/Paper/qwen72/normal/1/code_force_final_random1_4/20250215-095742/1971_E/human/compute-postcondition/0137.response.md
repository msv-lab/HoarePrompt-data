The code snippet `n, k, q = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `q` respectively. This operation updates the values of these variables, while the rest of the variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` has at least `len(a)` elements, `b`, `bd`, `ad`, `k`, and `_` remain unchanged, `v` is now `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-2] / bd[len(a)-2]]`, `l` is `q - 1`, `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` for each iteration, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql` for each iteration, and `ql` is the value of `int(input()) - a[s - 1]` for the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**
