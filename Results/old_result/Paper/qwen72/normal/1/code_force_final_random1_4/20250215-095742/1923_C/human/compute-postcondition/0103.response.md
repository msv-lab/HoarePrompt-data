The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively.

- `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `m` is assigned the second integer from the input.

The initial state variables `_`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `s` are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`m` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the first integer from the input, `_` is `m` (initially 0), `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1, or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`.**
