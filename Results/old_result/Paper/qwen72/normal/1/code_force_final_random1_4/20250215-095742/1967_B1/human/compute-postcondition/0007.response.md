The value of `g` is calculated as the integer division of `n` by `count`. Given that `count` is 2, `g` will be `n // 2`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n // 2`.**
