Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `i` is 0, the character at index 0 of the string `s` is 'L', and `b` now contains the element at index `l` of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(a[l])` adds the element at index `l` of the list `a` to the list `b`. The values of `n`, `i`, and the character at index 0 of the string `s` remain unchanged. The new state includes the updated list `b` which now contains the element from `a` at index `l`.
