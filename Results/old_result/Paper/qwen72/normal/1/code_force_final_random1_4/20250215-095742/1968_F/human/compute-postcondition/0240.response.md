Output State: **`q` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is incremented by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index in `v2` where `r` would fit to maintain sorted order minus 1.**

Explanation:
- The line `it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1` updates the value of `it2`.
- `it2` is now the index in `v2` where `r` would fit to maintain sorted order, minus 1.
- All other variables (`q`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
