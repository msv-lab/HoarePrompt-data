Output State: **After all iterations, `n` and `m` remain positive integers such that \(12 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(4 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `x` is 3, `y` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 4 such that \((x + y) * x > n\) or \((x + y) * y > m\), and `cnt` is increased by the sum of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs of `x` and `y` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and the conditions \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\) are satisfied.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These values remain within the given range as they are not modified by the loop.
- **`x`**: The value of `x` remains 3 throughout the loop.
- **`y`**: The value of `y` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration. The loop continues until \((x + y) * x > n\) or \((x + y) * y > m\). Therefore, `y` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to 4 that causes one of these conditions to fail.
- **`cnt`**: The value of `cnt` is incremented by `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for each pair of `x` and `y` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and the conditions \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\) are satisfied. This means `cnt` will be the sum of these values for all valid pairs of `x` and `y`.
