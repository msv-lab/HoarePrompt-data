You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`, representing the number of items, the price per item, and the promotional price for two items, respectively. The function calculates and prints the minimum cost to purchase `A` items based on the following rules: if the cost of two items individually (`B * 2`) is less than the promotional price (`C`), it prints `A * B`. If `A` is even, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`. If `A` is odd, it prints `X * C + B` where `X = A // 2`. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the minimum cost for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.
   - The cost of one yogurt is `a` burles.
   - The cost of two yogurts is `b` burles.
   - We need to consider both the regular price and the promotional price to minimize the total cost.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` representing `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively.
   - It then checks if the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is less than the promotional price (`C`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means buying yogurts individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `A * B`.
     - If `B * 2 >= C`, it means the promotional price is better.
       - If `A` is even, the total cost is `A * C / 2` because we can buy all yogurts in pairs.
       - If `A` is odd, we buy `A // 2` pairs at the promotional price and one additional yogurt at the regular price, so the total cost is `(A // 2) * C + B`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly handles the case where the regular price is cheaper.
   - The logic correctly handles the case where the promotional price is cheaper and `A` is even.
   - The logic correctly handles the case where the promotional price is cheaper and `A` is odd.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `A` is 1 or 2.
   - The program correctly handles the maximum values of `A`, `B`, and `C` within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts considering both the regular and promotional prices. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
