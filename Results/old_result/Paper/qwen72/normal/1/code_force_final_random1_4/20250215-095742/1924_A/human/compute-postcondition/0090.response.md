Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1 or `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0, and `cur` is the final value of the bitmask representing the characters seen in the current sequence.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`**: These variables are not modified within the loop, so their values remain unchanged.
- **`s`**: The input string `s` is iterated over, but its value does not change.
- **`cnt`**: This variable increments each time the bitmask `cur` reaches the value `(1 << k) - 1`, indicating that all `k` unique characters have been seen in the current sequence.
- **`ans`**: This string accumulates the characters from `s` that cause `cur` to reset to 0, meaning these characters complete a sequence of `k` unique characters.
- **`cur`**: This variable is a bitmask that tracks which characters have been seen in the current sequence. It resets to 0 each time `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1`.

After the loop completes, `cnt` will hold the total number of sequences of `k` unique characters found in `s`, and `ans` will contain the characters that completed these sequences. The final value of `cur` will represent the bitmask of the last incomplete sequence of characters.
