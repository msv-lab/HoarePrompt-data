Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves a grid of dimensions n x m with cells colored 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, the function checks if the top-left cell is different from the bottom-right cell. If they are different and all cells in the first and last rows are the same, and all cells in the first and last columns are the same, the function outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, it outputs 'YES'. The function prints the result for each test case and does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without modifying any global state. **
