Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible to have a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move consists of adding or removing one cube from the top of the tower. The logic in the program checks several conditions to determine if the desired state can be achieved:

1. If `n == m`: This means that all `n` moves were used to add cubes, resulting in a tower of `m` cubes. This condition correctly identifies when the tower can be built by simply adding cubes.

2. If `m > n`: This condition correctly identifies that it's impossible to have more cubes (`m`) than the number of moves (`n`), as you cannot add more cubes than the number of moves available.

3. If `m == n - 1`: This condition checks if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves by alternating between adding and removing cubes, starting with an addition. This is a valid scenario because you can start by adding a cube and then alternate, ending up with one less cube than the total number of moves.

4. If `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`: This condition checks if both `m` and `n` are even. If both are even, it's possible to achieve the desired state by ensuring that the number of additions and removals balance out to leave an even number of cubes.

5. If `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`: This condition checks if both `m` and `n` are odd. Similar to the previous condition, if both are odd, it's possible to achieve the desired state by ensuring that the number of additions and removals balance out to leave an odd number of cubes.

6. Else: If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'No', which is the correct behavior if the desired state cannot be achieved.

The program correctly handles all the specified conditions and outputs the correct result for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
