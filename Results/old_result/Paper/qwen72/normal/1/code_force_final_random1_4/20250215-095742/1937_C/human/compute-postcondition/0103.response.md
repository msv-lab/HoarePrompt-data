Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `res` is the new input string and its current value is `<`, `k` is the last index `i` for which the input was `<` and since `res` is currently `<`, `k` is now 1, and `best` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `best = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to the variable `best`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state reflects that `best` is now 1.
