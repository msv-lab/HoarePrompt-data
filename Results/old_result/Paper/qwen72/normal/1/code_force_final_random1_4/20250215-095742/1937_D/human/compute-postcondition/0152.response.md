The code snippet assigns the value of `B[r]` to the variable `a`. Since `r` is described as being decreased by 1, its value before the assignment is not specified, but it is clear that `r` is used as an index to access an element in the list `B`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `B[r]`**.
