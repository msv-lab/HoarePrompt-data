The values of `n` and `k` are updated by the function `func_4()`. Since the specific implementation of `func_4()` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact new values of `n` and `k`. However, we know that the function will assign new values to `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers assigned by `func_4()`, and 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12.**
