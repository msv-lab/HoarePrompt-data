The code snippet `u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `u` and `v`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `_` is a placeholder (no specific value needed)

After executing the code, the variables `u` and `v` will hold the integer values from the input.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `u` and `v` are integers from the input.**
