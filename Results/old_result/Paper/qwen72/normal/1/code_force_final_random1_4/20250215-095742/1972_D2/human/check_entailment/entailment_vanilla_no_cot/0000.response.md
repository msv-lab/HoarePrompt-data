Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as specified. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Pair Counting**: The function `func_1` attempts to count pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and then multiplies the counts based on the condition. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly handle the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`.

2. **Incorrect Loop Conditions**: The loops in `func_1` do not correctly iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges. Specifically, the loop conditions `while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m` are not appropriate for the problem's requirements.

3. **Incorrect GCD Handling**: The program checks if `gcd(x, y) == 1`, but this is not sufficient to ensure that `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`. The program needs to check the actual condition for each pair `(a, b)`.

4. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input for each test case inside `func_1`, which is not efficient and can lead to incorrect results when handling multiple test cases.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges.
- Check the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` for each pair.
- Count the number of valid pairs and print the result for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition directly, ensuring the correct count of valid pairs for each test case.
