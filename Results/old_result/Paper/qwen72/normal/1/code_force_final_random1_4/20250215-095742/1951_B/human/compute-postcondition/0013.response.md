The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` was either 0 or 1, depending on whether `a[i]` was not greater than `x` or was greater than `x`. After the increment, `c` will be either 1 or 2. If `c` becomes 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `x` is equal to `a[k]`, `ind` is a list containing `[1]` if `a[i]` is not greater than `x`, otherwise `ind` is a list containing `[1, 1]`, `c` is 1 if `a[i]` is not greater than `x`, otherwise `c` is 2, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. If `c` is 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
