The function `goalIn` takes a tuple `pos` representing a position on the field and a list `goal` containing two sets of positions (the first set for the red team's goals and the second set for the blue team's goals). It returns 0 if `pos` is in the red team's goals, 1 if `pos` is in the blue team's goals, and -1 if `pos` is not in either set. The function does not modify any input parameters and only returns one of these three values based on the position provided.
