Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has been reset to 0, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to be reset to 0, `cur` is 0 or a bitmask representing the characters seen so far in the current sequence, `tmp` is 'b', and `cnt` is less than `n`.**

Explanation:
- `tmp` is updated to the character 'b' because `chr(ord('a') + i)` converts the ASCII value of 'a' (which is 97) plus the value of `i` (which is 1) to the corresponding character, resulting in 'b'.
- All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
