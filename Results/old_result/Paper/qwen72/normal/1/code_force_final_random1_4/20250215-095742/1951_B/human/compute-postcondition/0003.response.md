To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, and `i` should start from 0.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each element `a_i` is unique and within the range 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.
- `x` is equal to `a[k]`.
- `ind` is an empty list.
- `c` is 0.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `x` is equal to `a[k]`, `ind` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
