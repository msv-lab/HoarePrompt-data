Output State: **`it2` is the index in `v2` where the last element less than `r` is located, or -1 if no such element exists. All other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `it2` using the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module. This function finds the position in the sorted list `v2` where `r` would fit, and then subtracts 1 to get the index of the last element in `v2` that is less than `r`. If no such element exists (i.e., all elements in `v2` are greater than or equal to `r`), `it2` is set to -1. The values of `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `results`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, and `x` remain unchanged.
