Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `n` remains the input integer.
- The index `i` will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its last iteration.
- The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` will each contain `n` integers, as each element has been assigned a value from the input during the loop.
- The list `visited` remains a list of `False` values with length `n`, as it was not modified by the loop.
- The list `coef` remains a list of `None` values with length `n`, as it was also not modified by the loop.
