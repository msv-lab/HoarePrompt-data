Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `mini` will be the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`. The variable `ele` will be the last element processed from `lst`. The list `final` will contain all elements from `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini`, and `final` will be sorted in ascending order. The current length of `final` is 1, and the first element of `final` is 0. All other variables (`s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `n`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `i`, `lst`) remain unchanged. `c1` is equal to `o * 100 // n`, and the current value of `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.**
