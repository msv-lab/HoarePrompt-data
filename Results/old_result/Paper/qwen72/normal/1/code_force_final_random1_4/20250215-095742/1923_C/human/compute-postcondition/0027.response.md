Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input with `n` elements, `p` is a list containing `n+1` elements starting with 0 and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `l` up to that point, `c` is a list containing `n+1` elements starting with 0 and each subsequent element is the count of 1s encountered in `l` up to that point, `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`, and `j` is the total number of 1s in `l`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variables `n` and `m` also remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The list `l` is fully iterated over, so it still contains `n` elements.
- The list `p` starts with 0 and appends the cumulative sum of elements in `l` after each iteration. After `n` iterations, `p` will have `n+1` elements.
- The list `c` starts with 0 and appends the count of 1s encountered in `l` after each iteration. After `n` iterations, `c` will have `n+1` elements.
- The variable `i` is the sum of all elements in `l` because it accumulates the value of `x` in each iteration.
- The variable `j` is the total number of 1s in `l` because it increments by 1 each time `x` is 1.
