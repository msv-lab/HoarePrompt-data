Output State: **`array2` contains all the results of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is met. `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the same as in the initial state, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the new input, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, and `arr` is a list of integers.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, `array2` will contain the differences between consecutive elements of `arr`, multiplied by `a`, but only for those differences that are less than `b / a`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has run through all valid indices of `arr` except the last one. All other variables (`test_cases`, `feat`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
