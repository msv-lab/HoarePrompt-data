Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of `s` is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the string `s`. `i` is 0, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for char in s:
    if char in unique_chars:
        s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
        j -= 1
    else:
        unique_chars.insert(i, char)
        i += 1
        j += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 1, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the string `s`. If `char` is in `unique_chars`, all occurrences of `char` in `s` are replaced by `unique_chars[j-1]`, `i` is 0, and `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 2`. If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `char` is inserted at index 0 of `unique_chars`, `i` is 1, and `j` is `len(unique_chars)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 1. If `char` is in `unique_chars`, all occurrences of `char` in `s` are replaced by `unique_chars[j]`, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 3`, and `char` is the second character in `s` if `s` has at least 2 characters, with `unique_chars` being a sorted list of unique characters from the original `s`. If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `char` is inserted at index 2 of `unique_chars`, `i` is 2, `j` is `len(unique_chars) + 1`, and `char` is the second character in `s` if `s` has at least 2 characters.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 1. If `char` (the third character in `s` if `s` has at least 3 characters) is in `unique_chars`, `s` is updated by replacing all occurrences of `char` with `unique_chars[j]`, where `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 4` if the previous `char` was in `unique_chars` or `len(unique_chars)` if the previous `char` was not in `unique_chars`. `i` is 0 or 2 depending on whether the previous `char` was in `unique_chars`, and `j` is updated accordingly. If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `s` remains unchanged, `char` is the third character in `s` if `s` has at least 3 characters, `i` is 1 or 3 depending on whether the previous `char` was in `unique_chars`, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 2` if the previous `char` was in `unique_chars` or `len(unique_chars) + 2` if the previous `char` was not in `unique_chars`, and `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the original `s` with `char` inserted at index `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
