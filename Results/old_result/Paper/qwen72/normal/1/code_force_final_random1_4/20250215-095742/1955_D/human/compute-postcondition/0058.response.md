Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than `2m`, `m` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `b` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is `m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is incremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0 after decrementing, and `ans` is 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` remains 0.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1` decrements the count of `a[i + m]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0 after this decrement, `curr` is incremented by 1. The value of `ans` is updated to 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `ans` remains 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
