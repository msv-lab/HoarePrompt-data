Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is calculated as the bitwise XOR (`^`) of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`.
- The values of `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged except for their indices being adjusted due to the increase in `idx`.
- `idx` is increased by 2, so the new values of `l` and `r` are now based on the updated `idx`.
- All other conditions from the initial state remain valid.
