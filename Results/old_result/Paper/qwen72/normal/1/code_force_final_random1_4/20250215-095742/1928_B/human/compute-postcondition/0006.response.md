Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least two elements, `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, `tem` is now `arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`.**

Explanation:
- `arr` remains unchanged as a list of positive integers with at least two elements.
- `ans` remains a list containing the last element of `arr`.
- `tem` was initially set to the last element of `arr` (`arr[len(arr) - 1]`). After executing the code, `tem` is updated to be the product of the last element of `arr` and the second-to-last element of `arr` (`arr[len(arr) - 2]`).
- `i` remains `len(arr) - 2`.
