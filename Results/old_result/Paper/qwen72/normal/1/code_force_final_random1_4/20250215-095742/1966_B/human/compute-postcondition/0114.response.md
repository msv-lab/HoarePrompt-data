Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer provided by the new user input, `m` is the second integer provided by the new user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a user input, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 'NO', the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`. For all `j` from 0 to `m - 2`, the conditions `gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]` and `gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]` are true, and `impossible` is `True`.**
