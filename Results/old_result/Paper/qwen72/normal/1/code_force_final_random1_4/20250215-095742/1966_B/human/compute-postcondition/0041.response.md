Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the integer provided by the user input, `m` is the integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` user input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, `impossible` is True because all adjacent strings in `gr` have the same first and last characters, and `ans` is 'NO'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans = 'NO'` assigns the string 'NO' to the variable `ans`. Since this assignment does not affect any other variables, the rest of the initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the updated value of `ans`.
