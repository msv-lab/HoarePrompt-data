The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which represents the current iteration count of the loop. The loop iterates a fixed number of times based on the value returned by `int(input())`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `p_i` is a list of four integers where 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200
- `a` is a list of integers
- `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in the list `a`

For the loop to execute one more time, the iteration count represented by `_` must be incremented by 1. However, since `_` is not explicitly stored or referenced outside the loop, we don't need to adjust it directly. Instead, we need to ensure that the loop can still run for the next iteration.

Given that the loop runs a fixed number of times determined by the input, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same for all other variables (`t`, `p_i`, `a`, and `cnt`), except that the loop counter (represented by `_`) is incremented implicitly by the loop mechanism.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` is a list of four integers where 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200, `a` is a list of integers, and `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in the list `a`**.
