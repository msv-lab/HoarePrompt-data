Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the total number of 'F' and 'S' characters at each index across all input strings, respectively. `xx` is a list containing `n` user input strings. `sa` and `sb` are lists containing indices where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, and `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, respectively. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `sa` includes any indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where both `a[j]` and `b[j]` are 0, and for each string in `xx`, a new string `nx` is printed where each character is either the original character if it is not a question mark (`?`), 'F' if the current index `j` or the index `i` is in the first quarter of `sa`, or 'S' otherwise. If the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, for each index `j` from 1 to `n`, if `a[j]` and `b[j]` are both 0, then `sb` contains the value `j`, and the variable `nx` will contain the final constructed string for each iteration, where each character is determined by the conditions specified in the loop: if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not a question mark ('?'), the corresponding character from `xx[i][j - 1]` is appended to `nx`; if `xx[i][j - 1]` is a question mark ('?') and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, 'S' is appended to `nx`; otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.**
