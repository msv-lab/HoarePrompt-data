Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is -1, `pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers provided by the user, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs from `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` for each valid `v` from `na_frente` to 0, and `best` is the minimum value between the initial `best` (10^12) and the updated `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each valid `v`.**

### Explanation:
- **`na_frente`**: The loop starts with `na_frente` and decrements it by 1 in each iteration until it reaches -1, which is the condition for the loop to terminate.
- **`pos_final`**: This variable is decreased by 1 initially and remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`total`**: This variable accumulates the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each valid `v` from `na_frente` to 0.
- **`best`**: This variable is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each valid `v` from `na_frente` to 0.
- **Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`, `cases`, `c`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
