Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `p` is a list containing a single element 0, `c` is a list containing a single element 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0. If `x` is 1, then `j` is set to 1 and `x` remains 1.***
