The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `arr` and determines the winner of a game between Alice and Bob. The game rules are not explicitly defined in the code, but based on the logic, if the first element of `arr` is not 1, the function immediately returns 'Alice'. Otherwise, it checks the differences between consecutive unique elements in the sorted version of `arr`. If any difference is greater than 1, the function returns 'Alice'. If all differences are 1, the function toggles a boolean flag `A` and returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise 'Bob'. In all cases, the function returns either 'Alice' or 'Bob'.
