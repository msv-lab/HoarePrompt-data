Output State: **`s` must contain at least one element, `i` is the second element in `s`. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, and `i` is equal to `h`, `z` is set to 1 and `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is equal to 1, `ans1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans1` is increased by 1. If `s[0]` is equal to `h`, the values of `z` and `ans1` remain unchanged. `z` is now 1.**
