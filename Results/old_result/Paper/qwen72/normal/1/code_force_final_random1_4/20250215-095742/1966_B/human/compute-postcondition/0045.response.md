The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `tc` relative to `t`. If `tc` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is 0, and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `tc` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the integer provided by the user input, `m` is the integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` user input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`. If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, `ans` remains 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.**
