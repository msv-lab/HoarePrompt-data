The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 (so `j` is 2), and `n` must still satisfy the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 24.

State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2**
