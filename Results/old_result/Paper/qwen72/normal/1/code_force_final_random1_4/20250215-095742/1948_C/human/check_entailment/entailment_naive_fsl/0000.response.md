Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it checks the conditions for the robot's movement. Specifically, the condition `if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':` is not sufficient to ensure that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n). This condition only checks specific positions and does not account for all possible movements and interactions between the arrows in the grid.

A counterexample to demonstrate this issue:

Input:
```
1
4
>><<
>>><
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output from the program:
```
No
```

In this case, the robot can indeed reach the cell (2, 4) with the following path:
1. Start at (1, 1)
2. Move right to (1, 2)
3. Move right to (1, 3)
4. Move down to (2, 3)
5. Move right to (2, 4)

However, the program incorrectly prints "No" because it fails to consider all possible paths and interactions between the arrows. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
