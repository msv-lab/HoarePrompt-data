To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the variables in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains `i` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0.
3. **Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` should start at 0 for the loop to iterate correctly.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n`**: Must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- **`i`**: Should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

### Given Initial State:
- `smin` is a list containing a single element 0.
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `j` is 1.
- `b` is a list of strings from the new input.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`.
- `l` is a list of integers from the new input.
- `suf` is now a list containing `n + 1` elements starting with 0 and followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `sm` is updated based on certain conditions.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0.

### Final State:
State: **`smin` is a list containing a single element 0, `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 1, `b` is a list of strings from the new input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the new input, `suf` is now a list containing `n + 1` elements starting with 0 and followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `i` is 0, `sm` is updated based on certain conditions.**
