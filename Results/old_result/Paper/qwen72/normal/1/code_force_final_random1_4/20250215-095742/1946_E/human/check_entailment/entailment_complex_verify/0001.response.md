Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to count the number of permutations of length `n` that match the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums. The result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function indeed implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the coefficients \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(ax + by = \gcd(a, b)\). In this context, it is used to find the modular inverse of `b` under modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - **func_2(a, b)**: This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `b` and then multiplies it by `a`, returning the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Essentially, it computes \(a \times b^{-1} \mod 10^9 + 7\).

3. **Checking the Main Logic**:
   - The main part of the program initializes a factorial array `facts` to store the factorials of numbers up to 200,000, which is used for combinatorial calculations.
   - For each test case, it reads the input values `n`, `m1`, and `m2`, and the lists of prefix and suffix maximums `p` and `s`.
   - It checks if the last element of `p` is the same as the first element of `s`, and if the first element of `p` is 1 and the last element of `s` is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, indicating no valid permutations.
   - It then calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial logic:
     - It iterates over the suffix maximums and calculates the combinations using the precomputed factorials and modular inverses.
     - It then reverses the prefix maximums and performs similar calculations.
     - Finally, it multiplies the results of the combinatorial calculations and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Validation of the Combinatorial Logic**:
   - The program correctly uses combinatorial logic to count the number of valid permutations. The use of factorials and modular inverses ensures that the calculations are performed efficiently and correctly.
   - The conditions checked (e.g., `p[-1] == s[0]`, `p[0] == 1`, `s[-1] == n`) ensure that the given indices are consistent with the properties of prefix and suffix maximums.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions and the main logic are correctly implemented to solve the problem as stated. The program effectively counts the number of valid permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.

Final: **True**
