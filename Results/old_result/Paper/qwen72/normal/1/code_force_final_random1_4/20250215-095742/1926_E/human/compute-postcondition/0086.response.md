Output State: **_ is t - 1, t remains unchanged, n is 0, k is the second input integer, m is the last computed value of (n + 1) // 2 before n became 0 or non-positive, L is a list containing all the values of (n + 1) // 2 computed during the loop, tot is 0, pow is 1.**

### Explanation:
- **_**: Remains `t - 1`.
- **t**: Remains unchanged.
- **n**: After the loop finishes, `n` becomes 0 because the loop continues as long as `n` is positive.
- **k**: Remains the second input integer, as it is not modified in the loop.
- **m**: Is the last computed value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0 or non-positive.
- **L**: Contains all the values of `(n + 1) // 2` that were computed during each iteration of the loop.
- **tot**: Remains 0 because `tot` is never updated in the loop.
- **pow**: Remains 1 because `pow` is never updated in the loop.
