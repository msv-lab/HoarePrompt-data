The only objects in the loop head are the variable `y` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 1 element, `y` is the first element in the list `a`, and `a_values` contains the integer value of `y` appended to it. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `y` will be the second element in the list.

State: **`a` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 elements, `y` is the second element in the list `a`, `a_values` contains the integer value of the first element of `a` appended to it.**
