Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, and `j` is 1. If the difference between the second element (`lis[1]`) and the first element (`lis[0]`) of `lis` is greater than 1, `test` is set to False, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.***
