Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, the second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the user input, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, the second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the user input and must have at least 2 elements. If the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]` is 2, then `ans` is `x + y - 1` and `tmp` remains an empty list. Otherwise, if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2 + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`. If none of these conditions are met, `ans` remains `x + y - 2`, and `tmp` and `y` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, the second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the user input and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `y` is updated to `y - ((a[1] - a[0]) // 2 - 1)` if `(a[1] - a[0]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[1] - a[0]) // 2 - 1`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged. Additionally, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` if the condition is met, otherwise `tmp` remains empty, and `ans` is incremented by `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` if the condition is met, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, the second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the user input and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `ans` is 1 if `a[1] - a[0] == 2`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `tmp` contains one element if the condition is met, otherwise it remains empty. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is updated to 2. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] != 2` and the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` is met, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1)` and `ans` is updated to `ans + (a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
