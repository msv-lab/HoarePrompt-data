Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by the total number of 'F' characters at index `j - 1` across all input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is incremented by the total number of 'S' characters at index `j - 1` across all input strings, `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, each of which is a user input string, `sa` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, and the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. For each index `j` from 1 to `n`, if `a[j]` and `b[j]` are both 0, then `sb` now contains the value `j`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sb[:n // 4] or j in sb[:n // 4]:
            nx += 'S'
        else:
            nx += 'F'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is still 1, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with elements incremented based on the total number of 'F' and 'S' characters at each index across all input strings, respectively. `xx` is a list containing `n` user input strings. `sa` and `sb` are lists containing indices where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, and `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, respectively, with the length of `sa` being less than the length of `sb`. For each index `j` from 1 to `n`, if `a[j]` and `b[j]` are both 0, then `sb` contains the value `j`. The variable `nx` is a string that has been built by iterating through the string `xx[1]` and appending each character to `nx` unless it is a '?'. If a '?' is encountered, 'S' is appended if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`; otherwise, 'F' is appended. After all iterations, `nx` will contain the final constructed string based on these rules.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop has executed all iterations, `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is `n + 1`. The string `nx` will contain characters from the `i`-th input string in `xx` where the corresponding character is not '?'. For positions where the character is '?', `nx` will contain 'S' if the index `i` or the current position `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`. Otherwise, `nx` will contain 'F' for those positions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `j` will be `n + 1`, `i` will remain `n + 1`, and `nx` will be a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, for each index `j` from 1 to `n` in the loop: if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not a question mark ('?'), the corresponding character from `xx[i][j - 1]` is appended to `nx`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is a question mark ('?') and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, 'S' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`. The variables `n`, `i`, `xx`, and `sb` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
