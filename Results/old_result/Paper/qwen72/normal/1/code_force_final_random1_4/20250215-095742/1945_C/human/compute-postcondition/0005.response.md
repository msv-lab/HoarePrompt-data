Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer and is even, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `pk` is calculated as `n / 2`, where `n` is an even integer. All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
