Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is 1, for each test case, n and q are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5; a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30; each query is represented by two integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    q = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    a = [0] * (n + 1)
    pf = [0] * (n + 1)
    mp = {(0): [0]}
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        a[i] = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
        if pf[i] not in mp:
            mp[pf[i]] = []
        mp[pf[i]].append(i)
    for _ in range(q):
        l = int(data[idx])
        r = int(data[idx + 1])
        idx += 2
        x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
        if x == 0:
            results.append('YES')
            continue
        v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
        v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
        it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
        it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
        if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    results.append('')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]` and is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` and is greater than 0, `idx` is increased by `n + 3 * q`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the integer value of `data[idx - (n - i + 1)]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, and the rest are zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index, and the rest are zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values in `pf` and values being lists of indices where those values occur, `i` is `n`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, and an additional empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop has executed all iterations, `q` is 0, `idx` has been incremented by `2 * q_initial` (where `q_initial` is the initial value of `q`), `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, followed by an additional empty string. The values of `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` are no longer relevant as they are re-initialized in each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `q` is 0, `idx` has been incremented by `2 * q_initial + n + 1`, `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, followed by two additional empty strings, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]` before the loop started, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from `a[1]` to `a[n]` is set to the corresponding integer value from `data[idx]` as the loop iterated, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from `pf[1]` to `pf[n]` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index, `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values in `pf` and values being lists of indices where those `pf` values occur, and `i` is `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
