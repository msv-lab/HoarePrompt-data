The provided initial state and the Python code snippet do not directly correlate in a way that influences the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `m`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 100.
- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` and `m` are updated to new input integers.
- The conditions based on the relationship between `n` and `m` are re-evaluated with these new values.

However, none of these variables or conditions affect the `print` statement, which only prints the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
