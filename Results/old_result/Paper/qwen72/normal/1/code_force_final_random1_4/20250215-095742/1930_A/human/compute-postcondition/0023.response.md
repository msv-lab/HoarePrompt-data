Output State: **_ is 1, n is a new input integer greater than 0, l is a sorted list of integers from user input, score is equal to the sum of every second element starting from the first element up to the (2 * n - 2)-th element of l, i is 2 * n - 2.**

### Explanation:
- The variable `_` remains 1 as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains a new input integer greater than 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `l` remains a sorted list of integers from user input, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `score` accumulates the sum of every second element starting from the first element (index 0) up to the (2 * n - 2)-th element (index 2 * n - 2). This means it sums the elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., (2 * n - 2).
- The variable `i` ends up being 2 * n - 2 after the loop completes, as the loop increments `i` by 2 each iteration until `i` reaches 2 * n - 2.
