Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

- Initial State:
  - `i` is 1
  - `n` must be greater than 1 (though `n` is not used in the print statement)
  - `r` is decreased by 1 (though `r` is not used in the print statement)

- Code Snippet:
  ```python
  print(i + 1, end=' ')
  ```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `i` is initially set to 1.
2. The expression `i + 1` evaluates to `1 + 1`, which is 2.
3. The `print` function is called with the argument `2` and the `end` parameter set to `' '`, which means that after printing `2`, a space will be added instead of a newline.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **2 **
