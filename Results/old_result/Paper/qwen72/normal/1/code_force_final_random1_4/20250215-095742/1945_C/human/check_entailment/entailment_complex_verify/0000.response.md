### Reasoning:

1. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does indeed handle the case where the entire village should be declared as one side. In the final part of the function, if no valid positions are found (`len(final) == 0`), it checks the overall preference of the residents:
     ```python
     if len(final) == 0:
         c1 = o * 100 // n
         if c1 >= 50:
             final.append(0)
         else:
             final.append(n)
     ```
     This ensures that if the majority of residents prefer the right side, the road is placed after the last house (`n`), and if the majority prefers the left side, the road is placed before the first house (`0`). This handles edge cases like `000` and `111` correctly.

2. **Calculation of Percentages**:
   - The use of percentages (`zero_perc` and `one_perc`) is not strictly necessary, but it does not introduce errors in the logic. The conditions `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` effectively check if at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. This is equivalent to checking if the number of zeros on the left side is at least half of the left side and the number of ones on the right side is at least half of the right side.

3. **Minimizing Distance**:
   - The program correctly minimizes the distance from the middle of the village. It maintains a list of valid positions (`lst`) and then finds the position with the minimum absolute difference from `pk` (the middle of the village). If multiple positions have the same minimum distance, it sorts the list and selects the smallest index:
     ```python
     for elem in lst:
         if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
             final.append(elem)
     final.sort()
     print(final[0])
     ```

4. **Edge Case Handling for All-Zero or All-One Strings**:
   - As mentioned earlier, the program handles these cases correctly by checking the overall preference of the residents and placing the road accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment identified some potential issues, but upon closer inspection, the program correctly handles all the edge cases and the main logic. The use of percentages is a bit unconventional but does not introduce errors. The program correctly minimizes the distance from the middle of the village and handles multiple positions with the same minimum distance.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
