The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is already an input integer greater than 0, this line of code will overwrite the current value of `n` with a new input integer, which must also be greater than 0.

The other variables (`_`, `l`, `score`, `i`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `score` is equal to the sum of every second element starting from the first element up to the (2 * n - 2)th element of `l`, `i` is 2 * n - 2.**
