Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by a sequence of integers read from the input, `ad` is a list containing the integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a` (i.e., `a[i] - a[i-1]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a)-1`), `bd` is a list containing only the integer 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
- The lists `a` and `b` also remain unchanged.
- The list `ad` now contains the initial value 0 followed by the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a`.
- The list `bd` remains unchanged, still containing only the integer 0.
- The variable `i` has reached the value `len(a) - 1`, which is the last index of the loop iteration.
