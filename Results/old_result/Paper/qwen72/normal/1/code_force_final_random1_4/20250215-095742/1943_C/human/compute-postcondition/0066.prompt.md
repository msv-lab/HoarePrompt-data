Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop continues to append the predecessor of the last element in `path_ba` until it encounters `-1`. At this point, the loop terminates. The final state of `path_ba` will be a list containing the sequence of predecessors starting from `b` and ending with the first vertex that has no predecessor (indicated by `-1`). The variable `n` will be `-1`, indicating the end of the path. The variables `_`, `u`, `v`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values. `ops` is an empty list. The length of `path_ba` is even. `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`. `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
    ops.append((c1, i))
    ops.append((c2, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `path_ba` is a list with a length of at least 4, `i` is 1, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `n` is `-1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c2 - 1, 1)` and `(c2, 1)`, and the variables `_`, `u`, `v`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `path_ba` is a list with a length of at least 4, `i` is 3, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `n` is `-1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c2 - 1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c2 - 1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`, and the variables `_`, `u`, `v`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `path_ba` is a list with a length of at least 9, `i` is 5, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `n` is `-1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c2 - 1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c2 - 1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c2 - 1, 5)`, and `(c2, 5)`, and the variables `_`, `u`, `v`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
