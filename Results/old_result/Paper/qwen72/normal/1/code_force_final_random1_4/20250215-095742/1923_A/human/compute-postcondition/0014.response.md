Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed.
4. `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
5. `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
6. `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(z.count('0'))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Remove Spaces from `arr`:**
   - `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed. For example, if the input string is `"a b c d"`, then `arr` becomes `"abcd"`.

2. **Find `x` and `y`:**
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
   - `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
   - If '1' is not found in `arr`, both `x` and `y` will be -1.

3. **Determine `z`:**
   - `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y`.
   - If `x` or `y` is -1, the substring might be invalid or empty.

4. **Count '0' in `z`:**
   - The `count` method is used to count the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring `z`.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **'1' is not found in `arr`:**
   - `x = -1` and `y = -1`.
   - The substring `z` will be invalid or empty, depending on the implementation.
   - In this case, `z.count('0')` will be 0 because there is no valid substring to count '0'.

2. **'1' is found in `arr`:**
   - `x` and `y` are valid indices.
   - `z` is the substring from index `x` to index `n - y`.
   - The number of '0's in this substring will be counted.

### Example:
- Suppose `arr` is `"00100100"`.
- After removing spaces, `arr` remains `"00100100"`.
- `x` is the index of the first '1', which is 2.
- `y` is the index of the last '1', which is 5.
- `n` is the length of `arr`, which is 8.
- `z` is the substring from index 2 to index 8 - 5, which is `arr[2:3]` (since `n - y = 3`).
- `z` is `"100"`.
- `z.count('0')` is 2.

### General Case:
- If '1' is not found, `z` is empty, and `z.count('0')` is 0.
- If '1' is found, `z` is a valid substring, and `z.count('0')` is the number of '0's in that substring.

### Final Output:
Output: **z.count('0') (where z is the substring of arr from index x to index n - y, and x and y are the indices of the first and last occurrence of '1' in arr, respectively)**

This output provides a precise description of what will be printed based on the initial state and the given code snippet.
