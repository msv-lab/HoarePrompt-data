The code snippet `sx += y * 2` updates the value of `sx` by adding `y * 2` to its current value. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `sx`, we assume it is already defined. The value of `y` is less than `c`, which is the integer part of `i` divided by 2. The array `val` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`val` is sorted such that odd numbers come before even numbers, and within each group, numbers are sorted in ascending order, and `val` must contain at least one element; `c` is the integer part of `i` divided by 2; `y` is less than `c`; `sx` is updated to `sx + y * 2`.**
