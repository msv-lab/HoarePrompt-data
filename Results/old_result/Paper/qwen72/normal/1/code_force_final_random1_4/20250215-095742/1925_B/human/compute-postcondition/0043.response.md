Postcondition: ***`x` is at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` remains less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`. If `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its original value and the current value of `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
