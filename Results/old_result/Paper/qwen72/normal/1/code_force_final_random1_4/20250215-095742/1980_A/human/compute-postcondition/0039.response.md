The code appends the value of `missing` to the list `results`. This operation updates the `results` list but does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the original elements and now includes the value of `missing`, `n` is the first element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty iterable, `freq` is a list where the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by the count of each corresponding character in `a`, `missing` is the sum of max(0, m - f) for each f in `freq`, `_` is incremented by 1.**
