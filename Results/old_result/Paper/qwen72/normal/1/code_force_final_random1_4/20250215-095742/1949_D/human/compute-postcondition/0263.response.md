Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3. If `xx[i][2]` is not '?', `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][2]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'F'.***
