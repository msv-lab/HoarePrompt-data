You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: `t` is 0, `i` is `t` (which is 0), `n`, `k`, and `m` are the last input integers for the final test case, `s` is the last input string for the final test case, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` across all test cases, `ans` is the final concatenated string for the last test case, and `cur` is the final bitmask representing the characters seen in the last sequence of the last test case. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n` for the last test case, `ans` contains the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is extended by the character `tmp` followed by `(n - cnt - 1)` 'a' characters, and `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to print one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It initializes `cnt` to count the number of complete subsequences found, `cur` to track the current bitmask of characters seen, and `ans` to store the constructed string.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`:
     - Converts the character to its corresponding index using `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.
     - Updates the bitmask `cur` if the character has not been seen before.
     - If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been seen at least once, so it increments `cnt` and resets `cur`.
     - Appends the character to `ans` if a complete subsequence is found.
   - After processing the string, it checks if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`:
     - If true, prints "YES".
     - If false, prints "NO" and constructs a string that does not occur as a subsequence:
       - Finds the first character that is missing from the current bitmask.
       - Appends this character to `ans` and fills the rest with 'a'.

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The logic for constructing the string that does not occur as a subsequence is flawed. The code appends the missing character and then appends 'a' to fill the rest of the string. This does not guarantee that the constructed string will not occur as a subsequence.
   - The code does not correctly handle the construction of the string that does not occur as a subsequence. It should generate a string that is guaranteed to not be a subsequence, which is not always achieved by the current logic.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The code does not correctly handle the construction of the string that does not occur as a subsequence.
   - Therefore, the code is incorrect.
