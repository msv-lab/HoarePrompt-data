Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + sum(odd) + gap`, `n`, `a`, `st`, `y` remain unchanged, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the first element of `even`, `odd` is a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element, `even` is a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element, `y` is `y - (gap // 2)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is updated to `y - (gap // 2)`.
- All other variables (`x`, `i`, `t1`, `t2`, `ans`, `n`, `a`, `st`, `next_elem`, `gap`, `odd`, `even`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `if y < gap // 2` is not checked here, as the code snippet only includes the assignment `y -= gap // 2`.
