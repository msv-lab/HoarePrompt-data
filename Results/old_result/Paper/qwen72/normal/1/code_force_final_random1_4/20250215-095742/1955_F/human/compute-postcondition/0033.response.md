Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p_i` is a list of four integers where 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200, `a` is a non-empty list of integers provided by user input, `cnt` is 1 + math.floor(x / 2) if `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]` and `a[0] % 2 == 1`, otherwise `cnt` is math.floor(x / 2), `x` is the first element of `a`.**

Explanation:
- `cnt` is updated by adding `math.floor(x / 2)` to its current value.
- If `a[0] == a[1] == a[2]` and `a[0] % 2 == 1`, then `cnt` was initially 1, so now `cnt` is `1 + math.floor(x / 2)`.
- Otherwise, `cnt` was initially 0, so now `cnt` is `math.floor(x / 2)`.
- The values of `t`, `p_i`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- `x` remains the first element of `a`.
