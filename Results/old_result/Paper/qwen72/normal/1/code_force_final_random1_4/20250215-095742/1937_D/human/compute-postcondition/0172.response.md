Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * r`**. 

Explanation: The value of `a` is calculated using the formula `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression simplifies to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * r`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
