Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than `m`. If the element at index 0 of list `a` is in the set `b_values`, the count of this element in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if the current value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. If the element at index `i + m` of list `a` is in the set `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is increased by 1. If the element at index 0 of list `a` is not in the set `b_values`, no changes are made to `cnt_b` or `curr`.***
