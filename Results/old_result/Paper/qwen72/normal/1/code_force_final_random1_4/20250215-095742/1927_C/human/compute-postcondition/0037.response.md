The value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer ≥ 1, `m` is an input integer ≥ 1, `k` is an input integer ≥ 1, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 4, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3. If `i` (which is now 4) is in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `aOnes`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is only in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is only in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
