Postcondition: ***`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `m` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `k` is a new input integer ≥ 1, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, `b` is a new list of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are ≤ `k` and also in `b` or ≤ `newk`, `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are ≤ `k` and also in `a` or ≤ `newk`. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.***
