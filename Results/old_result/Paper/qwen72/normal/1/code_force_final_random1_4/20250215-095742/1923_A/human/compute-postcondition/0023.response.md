Output State: **After all iterations, `t` is 0, and for each test case, `n` was an input integer, `arr` was the input string with all spaces removed, `x` was the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, `y` was the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`, and `z` was the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`. The loop printed the count of '0's in `z` for each test case.**

Explanation:
- After all iterations, `t` is reduced to 0 because the loop runs `t` times.
- For each iteration, `n` was an input integer, and `arr` was the input string with all spaces removed.
- `x` was the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
- `y` was the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
- `z` was the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.
- The loop printed the count of '0's in `z` for each test case.
