Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates a value `year` by iterating over the list `a`, adding either the current element `ai` or the remainder of `year` divided by `ai` (if non-zero) to `year`. The function prints the calculated `year` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes `t` being reduced to 0, `n` and `a` being updated for each test case, and `year` being the calculated value for each test case. **
