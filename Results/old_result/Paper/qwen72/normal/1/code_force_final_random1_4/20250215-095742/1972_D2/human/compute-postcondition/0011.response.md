Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(n \geq 3\) and \(m \geq 6\), `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cnt` is set to `min(n / 2, m // 2) + min(n / 3, m // 4)`**

Explanation:
- `x` is 1 and `y` is 2.
- `(x + y) * x` evaluates to \( (1 + 2) * 1 = 3 \).
- `(x + y) * y` evaluates to \( (1 + 2) * 2 = 6 \).
- `n / ((x + y) * x)` evaluates to \( n / 3 \).
- `m // ((x + y) * y)` evaluates to \( m // 6 \).
- `cnt` is initially set to `min(n / 2, m // 2)`.
- `cnt` is then updated by adding `min(n / 3, m // 6)` to its current value.
- Therefore, the final value of `cnt` is `min(n / 2, m // 2) + min(n / 3, m // 6)`.
