Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `l` is a new list of integers read from input, `d1` is a defaultdict with default values of 0, `d1[2]` is 1, `d1[4]` is either 1 or `l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`. `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default values of 0, `m` is an input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers provided by user input. If the last `y` > last `x`, then `y` is greater than `x`. If the last `y` â‰¤ last `x`, then `y` is less than or equal to `x`. If the difference between the third and second elements of `l` is less than the difference between the second and first elements of `l`, then `d1[4]` is 1. Otherwise, `d1[4]` is `l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`. If the difference between the fourth and third elements of `l` is less than the difference between the third and second elements of `l`, then `d1[5]` is 1 + `d1[4]`. Otherwise, `d1[5]` is `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`.**
