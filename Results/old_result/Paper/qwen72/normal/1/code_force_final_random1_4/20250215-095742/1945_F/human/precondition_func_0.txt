t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) representing the number of mushrooms, v is a list of n integers (1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9) representing the magic powers of the mushrooms, and p is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
