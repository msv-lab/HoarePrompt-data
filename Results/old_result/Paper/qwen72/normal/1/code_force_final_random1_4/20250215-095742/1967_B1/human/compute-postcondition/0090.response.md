Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by user input, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `count` is 4, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / 4) - 2) / 4) + 1 + int(int(n / 4) - 2) / 4 + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 4, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `int(n / 4)` if `g` is greater than or equal to `countmins`, otherwise the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
