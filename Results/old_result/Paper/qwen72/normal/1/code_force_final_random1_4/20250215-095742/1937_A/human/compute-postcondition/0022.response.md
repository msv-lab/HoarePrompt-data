The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n_cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n_cases` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n_cases` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the value of `n` remains 1. Otherwise, `n` is the log2 of the input integer and must be greater than or equal to the final value of `power` - 1. If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains `n + 1`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `n`.**
