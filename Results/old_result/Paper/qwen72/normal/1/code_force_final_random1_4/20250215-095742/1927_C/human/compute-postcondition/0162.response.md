Based on the initial state provided:

- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is updated to `t + 2`, but this does not affect the print statement.
- `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from input.
- `newk` is set to `k // 2`.
- `i` is set to `k + 1`.
- `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b` and were processed according to the loop conditions.
- `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are also in `a` and were processed according to the loop conditions.
- The loop has completed all iterations up to `k`.
- `aOnes` is equal to `newk`.
- `bOnes` is equal to `newk`.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('yes')` will simply print the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
