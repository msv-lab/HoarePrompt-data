The code snippet `f = feat[1]` reassigns the value of `f` to be the second element of the `feat` list. Since `feat` is a list of integers from the new input, and `f` was initially set to `feat[1]`, this operation does not change the value of `f`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the explicit confirmation of the value of `f`.

Output State: **`array2` contains all the elements `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` in the range `[1, n-1]` where `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a`. `i` is `n`. `n` is `feat[0]`. `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4. `feat` is a list of integers from the new input. `f` is `feat[1]`. `a` is `feat[2]`. `b` is `feat[-1]`. `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.**
