The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `ci`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `ci`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `ci + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `ci` must be at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. Since `ci` must be at least 0, `ci + 1` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 1, `ci` must be at least 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(c, 0)`**
