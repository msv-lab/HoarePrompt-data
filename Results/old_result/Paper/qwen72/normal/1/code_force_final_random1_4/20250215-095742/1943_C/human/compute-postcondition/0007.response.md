The code `u2vs[v].append(u)` adds `u` to the list `u2vs[v]`. This means that `u2vs[v]` now contains `u` as an additional element.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `u` is decreased by 1, `v` is an integer from the input decreased by 1, `u2vs[u]` now contains `v` as an additional element, `u2vs[v]` now contains `u` as an additional element.**
