Based on the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's break down the steps to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `A` is the first integer from user input.
   - `B` is the second integer from user input.
   - `C` is the third integer from user input.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(int(A * C / 2))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The code snippet calculates the expression `A * C / 2` and then converts the result to an integer using the `int()` function.
   - `A` is the first integer input by the user.
   - `C` is the third integer input by the user.
   - The expression `A * C / 2` multiplies `A` by `C` and then divides the result by 2.
   - The `int()` function truncates the result to the nearest integer towards zero.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The output will be the integer part of the result of the expression `A * C / 2`.

Therefore, the final output will be:
Output: **int(A * C / 2) (where A is the first integer input by the user and C is the third integer input by the user)**
