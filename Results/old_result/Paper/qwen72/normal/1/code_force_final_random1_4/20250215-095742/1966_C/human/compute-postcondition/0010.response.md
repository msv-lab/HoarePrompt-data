The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is the number of unique integers in `arr` and must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 3), and `n` must still be greater than 3 for the condition `i < n` to hold true.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is the number of unique integers in `arr` and must be greater than 3, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a 0, `i` is 3, `dp` is `True` if `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1`, otherwise `dp` is `False`**
