Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `line` is a list of substrings read from standard input with at least 2 elements, `ind` is 1, `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` contains key-value pairs for non-'..' substrings in the new `line`. If `line[0]` is not '..', `elements` includes the first element of `line` mapped to `(1, 0)`. If `line[ind]` (i.e., `line[1]`) is not '..', `elements` now includes the second element of `line` mapped to `(1, 1)`. `allPlayers` contains key-value pairs for player substrings in the new `line`. If `line[0]` is a player substring, the value for this player substring in `allPlayers` is set to `False`. If `line[0]` is not a player substring and the second character of `line[0]` is 'G', `tmp` is set to 1 and `goal[1]` now includes the tuple `(1, 0)`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged. `goal` contains lists of tuples for substrings ending in 'G' in the new `line`. If `line[0]` is not a player substring and `line[1][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(1, 1)`. If `line[1]` is '..', none of these additional changes occur.***
