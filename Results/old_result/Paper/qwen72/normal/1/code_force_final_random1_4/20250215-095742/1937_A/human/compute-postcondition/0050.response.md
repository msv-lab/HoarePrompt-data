The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. If `power` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 3, and `n` is `log2(n_cases)` where `n_cases` is greater than 4.

Given that `n_cases` is greater than 4, the minimum value for `n_cases` could be 5. The logarithm base 2 of 5 (log2(5)) is approximately 2.32, but since `n_cases` is an integer, the smallest integer value for `n` would be 3 when `n_cases` is 8 (since log2(8) = 3). However, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `power`, which is 3. Therefore, `n_cases` must be at least 16 for `n` to be 4 (since log2(16) = 4).

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `n_cases` must be at least 16, making `n` at least 4, and `power` must remain less than `n`.

State: **`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 16, `n` is `log2(n_cases)` which is at least 4, `power` is 3**
