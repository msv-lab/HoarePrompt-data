The value of `b` is updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its current value. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1
- `r` is decreased by 1
- `a` is the value of `B[r]`
- `b` is the value of `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise `b` remains the value of `A[l - 1]`

The new value of `b` is calculated as follows:
- `i - idx_A[l - 1]` results in `1 - idx_A[l - 1]`
- `(r + 1)` is the value of `r` after being decreased by 1, plus 1, which simplifies to the original value of `r`.

Therefore, the new value of `b` is `b + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, `b` is now `b + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`**.
