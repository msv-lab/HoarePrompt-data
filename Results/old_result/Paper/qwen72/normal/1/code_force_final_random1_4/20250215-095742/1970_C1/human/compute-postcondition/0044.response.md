Postcondition: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, dist + 1)` for each unvisited neighbor of the nodes that have been processed, but with the first element removed. `visited` set contains the integer `start` and all its unvisited neighbors, as well as all other nodes that have been processed. `current` is now equal to the first element of the tuple that was removed from the `queue`. `dist` is now equal to the second element of the tuple that was removed from the `queue`. `tree[current]` must contain at least one element. `queue` must not be empty. Additionally, `neighbor` is not in the `visited` set.**
