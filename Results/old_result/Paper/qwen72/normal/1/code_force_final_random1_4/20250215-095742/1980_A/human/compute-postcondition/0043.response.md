Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases` as input. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains a tuple `(n, m)` and a string `a`, where `n` is the number of problems in the bank, `m` is the number of upcoming rounds, and `a` is a string representing the difficulties of the problems. The function calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case to ensure that there are at least `m` problems of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). It returns a list of these minimum numbers for all `t` test cases. The original `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged. **
