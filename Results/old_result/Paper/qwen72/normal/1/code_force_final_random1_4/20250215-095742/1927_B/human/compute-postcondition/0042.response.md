Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `t-1`, `l` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list containing the letters corresponding to the counts of each element in `rev_array` starting from index `j` (which ranges from 0 to `l-1`) in the `alp` list, `j` is `l`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged as it represents the total number of test cases.
- **`i`**: After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `t-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`.
- **`l`**: For each test case, `l` is an input integer representing the length of the array.
- **`array`**: This is a list of integers provided by the user input for each test case.
- **`alp`**: This is a fixed list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'.
- **`rev_array`**: This is the reversed version of `array`.
- **`ans`**: This is a list that contains the letters corresponding to the counts of each element in `rev_array` starting from the end of `rev_array` up to the beginning. Each element in `ans` is determined by the count of the respective element in `rev_array` minus 1, and it is mapped to the corresponding letter in `alp`.
- **`j`**: After processing all elements in `array`, `j` will be equal to `l` for each test case.
