The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the string representation of `i`. The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, the string representation of `i` must still have characters left to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, and the loop has processed one character of `str(i)`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more character in `str(i)` to process.

Given that `i` is `n + 1`, if `i` is a multi-digit number, the loop will continue to the next digit. If `i` is a single-digit number, the loop will not execute again because there are no more characters to process.

Since `i` is `n + 1` and `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5, `i` could be a multi-digit number. However, without knowing the exact value of `n`, we can only say that if `i` is a multi-digit number, the loop will continue to the next digit.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `j` is the next character in the string representation of `i`.
- `i` remains `n + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5, `N` is greater than `n + 1`, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is the sum of the digits of the integer `1`, and `pd[i]` for each `i` from 2 to `n` is updated to `pd[i] + sum of digits of i`, `i` is `n + 1`, `pd[n + 1]` is now `pd[n + 1] + pd[n] + int(j)`, `j` is the next character in the string representation of `i`**.
