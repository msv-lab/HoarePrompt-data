The code snippet `x = [None] * n` changes the value of `x` from its initial state (a list of integers) to a new list of `None` values with length `n`. The other variables (`y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `y` and `r` are lists of integers where for each i (0 ≤ i < n), -10^9 ≤ y[i], r[i] ≤ 10^9, `visited` is a list of booleans initialized to False for each element, and `coef` is a list of None values with length `n`.**
