Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, the second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the user input and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the result of the expression `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given that `i` is 1, this means `a[1] - a[0]` is computed, and the result is integer divided by 2. This value is then appended to `tmp`, making `tmp` a list with one element. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
