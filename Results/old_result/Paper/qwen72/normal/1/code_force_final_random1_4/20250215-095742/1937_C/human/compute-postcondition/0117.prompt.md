Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function operates in an interactive environment where the input is provided through a series of queries and responses. The input consists of multiple test cases, each defined by an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4), representing the size of a permutation p of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function can make at most 3n queries to determine a pair of indices (i, j) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. Each query involves selecting four indices a, b, c, d (0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n) and receiving a response indicating the relationship between (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d). The total number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    k = 1
    for i in range(2, n):
        print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            k = i
    best = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            best = i
    print('!', k, best, flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than or equal to the final value of `i`, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the last input string. If any input was `<` during the loop, `k` is updated to 1 and `best` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<`. If no input was `<`, `k` remains 1 and `best` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the last input string, `k` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<` if any input was `<`, otherwise `k` remains 1, and `best` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<` if any input was `<`, otherwise `best` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is a placeholder, `n` remains the same as the initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the last input string received from the loop, `k` is 1 if any input was `<` during the loop, otherwise `k` remains 1, and `best` is the last index `i` for which the input was `<` if any input was `<`, otherwise `best` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
