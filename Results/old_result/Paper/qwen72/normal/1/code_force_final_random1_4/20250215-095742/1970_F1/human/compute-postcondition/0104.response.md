To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `time` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `time` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
