To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**:
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.
   - The loop condition depends on the length of the list `a`.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will execute if `len(a) > 1`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `i` is already 1, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `len(a)` must be greater than 1. This means `a` must have at least two elements.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - Variables `b`, `bd`, `ad`, `k`, `v`, `l`, `m`, `s`, `ql`, `n`, `q` are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `i` is 1.
- `a` must have at least two elements.

State: **`i` is 1, `a` must have at least two elements**.
