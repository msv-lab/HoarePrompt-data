Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new string `s`.
  - If `len(a) == 2`, then `a` contains exactly 2 unique characters.
  - Otherwise, `a` contains a number of unique characters not equal to 2.
- `b` is a string containing the characters of the new `s` sorted in ascending order.
- `c` is a string containing the characters of the new `s` sorted in descending order.
- If `b` (the sorted version of the new `s`) is equal to the new `s`, then the new `s` is already sorted in ascending order.
  - Otherwise, `b` is not equal to the new `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `b` is defined as the string containing the characters of the new `s` sorted in ascending order.
- Since `b` is explicitly defined as the sorted version of `s` in ascending order, the `print(b)` statement will print the characters of `s` in ascending order.

### Output:
The `print(b)` statement will print the characters of the string `s` sorted in ascending order.

Output: **b (where b is the string s sorted in ascending order)**
