Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with any number of characters, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is 0 or a value less than `(1 << k) - 1` depending on whether the final set of characters in `s` completed another full set of `k` unique characters, `cnt` is less than `n`, and `tmp` is 'b'.**

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` changes the value of `tmp` from either an empty string or 'a' to the character 'b'. This is because `i` is 1, and `ord('a')` returns the ASCII value of 'a', which is 97. Adding 1 to 97 gives 98, and `chr(98)` returns the character 'b'. All other variables remain unchanged.
