Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, and `word` is determined as follows: If `n` > 52, `word` is the character at index `n - 53` from the `alphabet` list followed by `'zz'`. If `n` > 26 and `n` ≤ 52, `word` is `'a'` followed by the character at index `n - 28` from the `alphabet` list and then `'z'`. If `n` ≤ 26, `word` is `'aa'` followed by the character at index `n - 3` from the `alphabet` list.***
