Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', `idx_A` is a list containing `[0]` if `len(idx_A) == 0` initially, otherwise `idx_A` is a list containing one more element than before, which is `i`. If `len(idx_A) == 0` initially, then `A` is a list containing `[0]` and `idx_A` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `A` is a list containing one element which is `(i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, and `idx_A` is not an empty list.**
