Precondition: **i is an integer representing the index of a disk, such that 0 <= i < n. n is a positive integer representing the number of disks, x and y are lists of integers where x[i] and y[i] represent the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, r is a list of positive integers where r[i] represents the radius of the i-th disk, visited is a list of booleans indicating whether the i-th disk has been visited, tot is an integer representing the total sum of coefficients, bipartite is a boolean indicating whether the graph is bipartite, and coef is a list of integers representing the coefficient of each disk.**
