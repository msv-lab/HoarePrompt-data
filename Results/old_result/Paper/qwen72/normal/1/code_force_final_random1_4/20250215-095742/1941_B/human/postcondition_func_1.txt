The function `func_2` takes a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5) as input. It modifies the list such that for each index `i` from 1 to `n-2`, if `list[i]` is greater than 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0, it decrements `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` until one of these conditions is no longer met. After processing, the function calls another function `func_1` with the modified list and `n`. If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The final state of the list is a list of non-negative integers where `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` are all set to 0 for each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, while `list[0]` and `list[n-1]` remain unchanged.
