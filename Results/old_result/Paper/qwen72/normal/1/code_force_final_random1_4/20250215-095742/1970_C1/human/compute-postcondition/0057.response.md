Output State: **The `start` and `target` remain integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. The `queue` is a deque that is now empty, indicating that all nodes have been processed. The `visited` set contains all nodes that were reachable from the `start` node, including the `start` node itself and all its neighbors and subsequent neighbors. If the `target` node was found, the loop returned the shortest distance (`dist`) from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node was not found, the loop terminated without returning a distance, and the `queue` is empty.**
