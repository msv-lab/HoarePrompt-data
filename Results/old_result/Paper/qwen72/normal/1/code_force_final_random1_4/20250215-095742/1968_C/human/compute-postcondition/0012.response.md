Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is a positive integer (at least 1).
- `x` is a list of integers derived from user input.
- `a` is a list of length `n` where:
  - The first element is 1000.
  - Each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`.
- The final value of `i` is `n-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*a)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `a`:**
   - The first element of `a` is 1000.
   - For each subsequent element in `a`, it is calculated as the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`.

2. **Construction of `a`:**
   - Let's denote the elements of `x` as `x[0], x[1], ..., x[n-1]`.
   - The elements of `a` will be constructed as follows:
     - `a[0] = 1000`
     - `a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 1000 + x[0]`
     - `a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = (1000 + x[0]) + x[1] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1]`
     - ...
     - `a[n-1] = a[n-2] + x[n-2] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]`

3. **Final List `a`:**
   - The list `a` will contain `n` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum starting from 1000 and adding the corresponding elements from `x`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

### Example Calculation:
- If `n = 3` and `x = [10, 20, 30]`:
  - `a[0] = 1000`
  - `a[1] = 1000 + 10 = 1010`
  - `a[2] = 1010 + 20 = 1030`
  - `a[3] = 1030 + 30 = 1060`
  - The list `a` will be `[1000, 1010, 1030, 1060]`.

### Final Output:
The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces. The elements of `a` are constructed as described above.

Output: **1000 1000 + x[0] 1000 + x[0] + x[1] ... 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]**
