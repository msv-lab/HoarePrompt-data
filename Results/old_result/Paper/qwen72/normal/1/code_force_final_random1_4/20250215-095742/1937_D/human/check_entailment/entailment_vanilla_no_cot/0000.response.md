Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It processes multiple test cases, each with a string of '<' and '>' characters, and calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid when placed on each cell. The logic for handling the movement of the pinball and the inversion of the direction after each move is implemented in a way that aligns with the problem's requirements. The program also handles edge cases, such as when the pinball starts at the edge of the grid, and ensures that the output format matches the expected output for each test case.

However, the complexity of the solution and the detailed logic make it challenging to verify correctness without extensive testing. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the approach taken by the program seems appropriate and should work for the specified input ranges. Therefore, based on the information provided and the structure of the code, the program is considered correct.
