### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1()` is used to read the number of test cases (`t`). This function correctly handles the input and returns an integer.
   - For each test case, `func_7()` is called to process the constraints and determine the number of valid integers `k`.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - `func_7()` initializes `start` to `-1` and `end` to `1000000000.0`. These values represent the initial bounds for `k`.
   - The function reads `n` constraints and updates `start` and `end` based on the type of constraint:
     - Type 1 (`t == 1`): Updates `start` to the maximum value of `v` encountered.
     - Type 2 (`t == 2`): Updates `end` to the minimum value of `v` encountered.
     - Type 3 (`t == 3`): Appends `v` to the list `num`, which stores the values that `k` must not be equal to.
   - After processing all constraints, the function checks if `start` is greater than `end`. If so, it returns 0 because no valid `k` can satisfy the constraints.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the count of values in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]` from the total number of integers in the range.

3. **Output:**
   - The main loop iterates over the number of test cases and appends the result of `func_7()` to the list `ans`.
   - Finally, the results are printed one by one.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes the constraints as described in the problem statement.
- The logic for updating `start` and `end` and counting the valid integers `k` is sound and matches the requirements.
- The edge cases (e.g., when `start` is greater than `end`) are handled appropriately.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True****
