The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is an input string. If `res` is `<`, then `k` is 2. Otherwise, `k` remains 1.**
