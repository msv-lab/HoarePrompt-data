To determine what will be printed by the `print(sm)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `n` must be at least 0.
- `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, and `suf` retain their initial values and conditions.
- If `sm` is less than 0, `sm` is now equal to `2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * (10`.
- Otherwise, `sm` is now equal to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `sm`**:
   - We need to check the condition: if `sm` is less than 0.
   - If `sm` is less than 0, then `sm` is set to `2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * (10`.
   - If `sm` is not less than 0, then `sm` is set to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10`.

2. **Evaluate the expression for `sm`**:
   - Since the initial value of `sm` is not explicitly given, we need to consider both cases:
     - **Case 1: `sm < 0`**:
       - `sm = 2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * (10`
       - Here, `suf[n]` is the last element of the `suf` list, and `a` is an unspecified integer.
     - **Case 2: `sm >= 0`**:
       - `sm = (2 + suf[n]) % (10`
       - Here, `suf[n]` is the last element of the `suf` list.

3. **Final Output**:
   - Since the exact values of `suf[n]` and `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.
   - If `sm < 0`, the output will be `2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * (10`.
   - If `sm >= 0`, the output will be `(2 + suf[n]) % (10`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(sm)` statement will print the value of `sm` based on the conditions provided. Since the exact values of `suf[n]` and `a` are not specified, the output will be described in terms of these variables.

Output: **sm (where sm is either 2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * (10 if sm < 0, or (2 + suf[n]) % (10 if sm >= 0)**
