Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is the third input integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 2 elements, and `i` is `len(a) - 1`. If `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`, `ans` is updated to `x + y + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` or `x + y - 1 + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` depending on the initial conditions, and `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `y`, `ans`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.***
