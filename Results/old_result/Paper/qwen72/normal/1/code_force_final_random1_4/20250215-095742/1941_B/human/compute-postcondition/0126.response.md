Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases, each involving an array of integers. For each test case, it checks if the array can be transformed such that the last two elements become zero by performing specific operations on the array elements. If any element in the array is negative before the transformation, or if the last two elements are not zero after the transformation, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. **
