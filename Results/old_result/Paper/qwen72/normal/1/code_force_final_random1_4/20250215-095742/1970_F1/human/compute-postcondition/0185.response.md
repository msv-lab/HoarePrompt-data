Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `time` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`.
   - `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`.
   - `nxt` is calculated as (`pos[0] + mov[com][0]`, `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`).
   - `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`.
   - `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `time` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`. Therefore, `time` is a positive integer.
   - `team` is the result of the function `goalIn(pos)`, which determines the team based on the position `pos`.
   - `GoalName` is a dictionary or list that maps the team to a specific name.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will format the output as `time` followed by the corresponding `GoalName` for the `team`.

Given the initial state, the output will be:
- The current value of `time` (a positive integer).
- The corresponding goal name from `GoalName` based on the `team` determined by `goalIn(pos)`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL (where [time] is the current value of time and [GoalName[team]] is the goal name corresponding to the team determined by goalIn(pos))**
