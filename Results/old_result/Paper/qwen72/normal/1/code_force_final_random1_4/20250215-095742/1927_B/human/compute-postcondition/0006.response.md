To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for j in range(l):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `j` and `l`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `l` is greater than 0. This is because `range(l)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `l-1`, and if `l` is 0 or negative, the sequence will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
3. **Initial State of `j`**: Before the loop starts, `j` should be initialized to 0, as it is the starting point of the range.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`l` must be greater than 0**: For the loop to execute, `l` must be at least 1.
- **`j` is 0**: This is the initial value of `j` before the loop starts.

### Final State:
Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is 0
- `l` is an input integer
- `array` is a list of integers provided by the user input
- `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'
- `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`
- `ans` is an empty list

We need to adjust `l` to ensure it is greater than 0 and set `j` to 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is an empty list, `j` is 0**
