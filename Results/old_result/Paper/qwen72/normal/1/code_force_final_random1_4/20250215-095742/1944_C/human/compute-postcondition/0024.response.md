Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is the length of the list `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object containing the counts of each integer in `arr`, with the count of `arr[0]` decreased by 1, the count of `1` decreased by 3, and the count of `start` (which is 1) further decreased by 1. `start` is 1. `vis` is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 1. The count of `1` in `nums` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums[start + 1] -= 1` decreases the count of the integer `start + 1` (which is `1 + 1 = 2`) in the `nums` Counter object by 1.
- Initially, the count of `1` in `nums` was already decreased by 2, and the count of `start` (which is 1) was further decreased by 1, making the total decrease for `1` in `nums` 3.
- The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
