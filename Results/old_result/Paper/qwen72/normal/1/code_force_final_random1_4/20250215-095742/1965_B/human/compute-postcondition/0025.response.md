Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is a list containing the values [1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2)], `lk` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is lk-2.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, and `bk` remain unchanged from their initial states.
- The list `ans` contains powers of 2 starting from 2^0 up to 2^(lk-2), where `lk` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`.
- The variable `i` will be equal to `lk-2`, which is the last index of the loop.
