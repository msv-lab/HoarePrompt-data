Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `numTest` is equal to `t`, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `opNum` is now `a[2]`, `a[0]` is 0, `a[1]` is `a[1] - a[2]`, `a[2]` is `a[2] - a[2]` (which means `a[2]` is now 0), `a[3]` is `a[3] - 3 * a[2]` (which remains unchanged since `a[2]` is 0). If `a[2]` is less than 0, `stop` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stop` remains False.**
