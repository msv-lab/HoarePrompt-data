Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it processes the game state. Specifically, the program uses a dynamic programming approach (`dp`) to determine the winner, but it incorrectly handles the transition between states. The key issue is in the loop where `dp` is updated:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    dp = arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp
```

This loop checks if the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted array is greater than 1, and updates `dp` accordingly. However, this logic does not correctly capture the game's rules, particularly the optimal play strategy.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

The expected output is "Alice" because Alice can always win by removing 1 stone from each pile, leaving Bob with no valid moves. However, the program will output "Bob" because the logic in the loop incorrectly determines the winner.

### Explanation of the Counterexample:
- The sorted and unique array `arr` is `[1, 2, 3, 0]`.
- The loop iterates over the elements `[1, 2, 3]`.
- For `i = 1`, `arr[1] - arr[2] = 1 - 2 = -1`, which is not greater than 1, so `dp` remains `True`.
- For `i = 2`, `arr[2] - arr[3] = 2 - 3 = -1`, which is not greater than 1, so `dp` remains `True`.
- The final value of `dp` is `True`, so the program outputs "Alice".

However, this is incorrect because Alice can always win by removing 1 stone from each pile, leaving Bob with no valid moves. Therefore, the program does not correctly handle this case and is thus incorrect.
