The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, we assume this is part of a loop, and the `continue` statement will cause the loop to proceed to the next iteration without changing any of the variables.

Output State: **`l` is 2, `q` is greater than 2, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain sorted order, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
