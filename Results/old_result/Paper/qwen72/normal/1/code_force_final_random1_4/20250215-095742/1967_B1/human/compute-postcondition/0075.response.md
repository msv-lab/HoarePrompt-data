Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by user input, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / count)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks before reaching `count = m + 1`. Otherwise, the loop continues.***
