The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ai` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in the list `a`, the loop will continue to the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `ai` was the second element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ai` must now be the third element in the list `a`, and the list `a` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `n` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in the list `a`, `year` is now `year + (year % ai or ai)`**
