Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, if `n` is even, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, if `n` is odd, `pk` is also set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of occurrences of '0' in `sl`, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's encountered in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's encountered in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - (n - 1) - 1)`, and `lst` must contain at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in `lst`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `mini` to the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The new value of `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and `abs(pk - ele)`.
