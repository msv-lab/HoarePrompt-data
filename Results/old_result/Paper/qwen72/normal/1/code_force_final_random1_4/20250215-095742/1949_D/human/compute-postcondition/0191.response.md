Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, `sa` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0` and any indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where both `a[j]` and `b[j]` are 0, `sb` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `j` is 2. If the character at index 2 in the string `xx[3]` is not '?', then `nx` is the first character of `xx[3]` followed by the character at index 1 in the string `xx[3]`. Otherwise, if either `i` (which is 3) or `j` (which is 2) is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4]`), then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.**
