Let's break down the code step by step based on the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `p` is a list of four even integers derived from the input, where each element is the nearest even number less than or equal to the corresponding `p_i` value.

### Code Analysis:
```python
print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

1. **First Part: `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])))`**
   - `p[:3]` takes the first three elements of the list `p`.
   - `map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])` applies the lambda function to each of these three elements. The lambda function checks if the element is odd (`x % 2 > 0`).
   - Since `p` is a list of even integers, none of the elements in `p[:3]` will be odd. Therefore, the result of the map function will be a list of `False` values.
   - `list(map(...))` converts this map object to a list of `False` values.
   - `sum(list(...))` sums up the boolean values. In Python, `False` is equivalent to 0, so the sum will be 0.

2. **Second Part: `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)`**
   - We already determined that the sum is 0.
   - `0 == 3` evaluates to `False`.
   - In Python, `False` is equivalent to 0, so this part evaluates to 0.

3. **Third Part: `sum(p) // 2`**
   - `sum(p)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `p`.
   - Since `p` is a list of four even integers, the sum of these integers will also be even.
   - `sum(p) // 2` performs integer division by 2, which will result in an integer.

4. **Final Calculation: `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2`**
   - We have determined that `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` evaluates to 0.
   - Adding this to `sum(p) // 2` gives us `0 + sum(p) // 2`, which simplifies to `sum(p) // 2`.

### Conclusion:
The final output will be the integer result of `sum(p) // 2`.

Output: **sum(p) // 2 (where sum(p) is the sum of all elements in the list p, and p is a list of four even integers)**
