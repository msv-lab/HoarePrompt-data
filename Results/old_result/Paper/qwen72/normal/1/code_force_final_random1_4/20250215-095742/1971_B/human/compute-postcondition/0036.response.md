Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new string `s`. If `len(a) == 2`, then `a` contains exactly 2 unique characters. Otherwise, `a` contains a number of unique characters not equal to 2, `b` is a string containing the characters of the new `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is a string containing the characters of the new `s` sorted in descending order. If `b` (the sorted version of the new `s`) is equal to the new `s`, then the new `s` is already sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, `b` is not equal to the new `s`.***
