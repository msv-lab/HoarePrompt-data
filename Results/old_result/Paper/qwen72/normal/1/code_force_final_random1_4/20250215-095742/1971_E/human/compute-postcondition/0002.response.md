The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `q` respectively. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. After executing the code, the values of `n`, `k`, and `q` are updated based on the input, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer.**
