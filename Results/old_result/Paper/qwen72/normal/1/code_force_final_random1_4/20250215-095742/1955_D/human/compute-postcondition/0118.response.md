Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from a new input, `i` is `m-1`, `m` is the total number of iterations, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its value is the count of occurrences in `b` minus the number of times the corresponding element in `a` has been encountered (but not less than 0), `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
