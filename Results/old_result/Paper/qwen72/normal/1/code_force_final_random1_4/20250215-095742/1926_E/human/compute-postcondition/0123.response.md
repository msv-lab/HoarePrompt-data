Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, if `k` is greater than half of `n` plus one, the function calculates a value `y` based on a series of operations involving `n` and `k`, and prints `y`. Otherwise, it simply prints `2 * k - 1`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ends, and the final state of the program includes the printed results for each test case. **
