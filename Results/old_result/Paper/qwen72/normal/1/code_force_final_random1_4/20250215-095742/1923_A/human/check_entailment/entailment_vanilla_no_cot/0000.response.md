Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads the number of test cases, processes each case by finding the positions of the first and last chips, and then counts the number of free cells within this range, which corresponds to the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips. This approach is efficient and directly addresses the requirements of the problem statement.
