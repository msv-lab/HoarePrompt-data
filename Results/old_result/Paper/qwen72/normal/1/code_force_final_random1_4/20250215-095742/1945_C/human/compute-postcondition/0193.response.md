Postcondition: **`mini` will be the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`, `ele` is the first element in `lst`, `lst` must have at least one element, `final` is an empty list, all other variables remain unchanged, and the current value of `abs(pk - elem)` is equal to `mini`.**
