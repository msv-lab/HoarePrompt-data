Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `new` is a list where each element up to the point where `a[i] != b[i]` or `i` reaches the end of the list is `max(a[i], b[i])` and the rest are `None` values, `new2` is a list where each element up to the point where `a[i] != b[i]` or `i` reaches the end of the list is `min(a[i], b[i])` and the rest are `None` values, `i` is the index where `a[i] != b[i]` or the length of `a` if all elements are equal, and `a[j] == b[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i-1`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to the length of `a`. The value of `new[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`, and the value of `new2[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])`.**
