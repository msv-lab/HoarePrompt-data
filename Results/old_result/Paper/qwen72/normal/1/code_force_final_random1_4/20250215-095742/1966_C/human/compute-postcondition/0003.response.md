The provided Python code snippet reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts them to a list of unique integers, sorts this list in descending order, and appends a 0 to the end of the list. This sorted list is stored in the variable `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `tc` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- For each test case, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of piles.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the initial number of stones in each pile.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

After executing the code:
- `arr` is now a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a 0.**
