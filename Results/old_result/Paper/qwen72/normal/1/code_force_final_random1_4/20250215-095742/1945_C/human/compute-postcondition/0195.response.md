Postcondition: ***`mini` will be the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`, `ele` is the first element in `lst`, `lst` must have at least one element, `final` is an empty list if `abs(pk - elem)` is not equal to `mini`. If `abs(pk - elem)` is equal to `mini`, `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.***
