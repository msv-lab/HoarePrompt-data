Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements where t must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` appended to it, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test` and must be at least 1, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and has `n` elements, `current_year` is now equal to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, `ai` is the third element of the list `a`, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `next_year` is calculated using the formula `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
- `current_year` is updated to be equal to `next_year`.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `a`, `ai`, `test`) remain unchanged or are still defined as per their initial state.
