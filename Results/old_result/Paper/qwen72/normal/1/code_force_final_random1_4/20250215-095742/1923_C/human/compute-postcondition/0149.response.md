To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `l` is a list of integers from user input.
   - `i` is the difference between the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `b` and the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `a-1` in `l`.
   - `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`.
   - `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`.
   - `c` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of `1`s in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`.
   - `n` and `m` must be greater than 2.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `a` and `b` are integers from user input.
   - `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

2. **Condition:**
   - If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met.
   - Otherwise, the condition is not met.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print('YES')` statement.

### Analysis:
- The `print('YES')` statement will execute if the condition `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is met.
- Let's break down the condition:
  - `b - a + 1 > 1` simplifies to `b - a > 0` or `b > a - 1`.
  - `s` is the difference in cumulative sums from `a-1` to `b` in the list `p`.
  - `i` is the difference in cumulative counts of `1`s from `a-1` to `b` in the list `c`.

### Conclusion:
- If the condition `b > a - 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is true, then the output will be 'YES'.
- Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and the list `l` are not provided, we cannot definitively determine if the condition is met without additional information.

However, based on the structure of the problem and the given condition, the print statement will output 'YES' if the condition is met.

Output: **YES (if the condition `b > a - 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is met)**
