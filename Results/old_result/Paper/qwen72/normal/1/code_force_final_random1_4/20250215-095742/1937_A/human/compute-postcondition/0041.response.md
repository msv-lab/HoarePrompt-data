To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `i` is 1
  - `n_cases` is greater than 1
  - `n` is the new input integer
  - If `n` is 1, the program does nothing.
  - Otherwise, `n` must be greater than or equal to the final value of `power` - 1.
  - If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains `n + 1`.
  - Otherwise, `power` is set to `n`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n_cases):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range defined by `n_cases`.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n_cases`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, `i` should be 2.
- **`n_cases`**: The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `n_cases`. Since `n_cases` is greater than 1, it remains unchanged.

### Final State:
- `i` is 2
- `n_cases` is greater than 1
- The other variables (`n` and `power`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
State: **`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 1**
