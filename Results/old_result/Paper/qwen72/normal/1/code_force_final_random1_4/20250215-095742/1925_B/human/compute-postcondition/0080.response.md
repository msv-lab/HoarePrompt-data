The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `n`. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= x. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `t`, `x`, and `n`, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^8, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and `x`. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific output is not specified.**
