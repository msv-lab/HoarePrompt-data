### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, the length of the array and the number of operations, respectively.
   - It then reads the array `l`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the prefix sums of the array `l` and stores them in the list `suf`. This is done to efficiently compute the sum of any subarray.

3. **Minimum Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The function maintains a list `smin` to keep track of the minimum prefix sum up to each index. This helps in finding the maximum subarray sum efficiently.

4. **Maximum Subarray Sum**:
   - The function iterates through the prefix sums and calculates the maximum subarray sum using the formula `suf[i] - smin[i]`. This ensures that the maximum subarray sum is found.

5. **Final Sum Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the final sum after `k` operations using the formula `2 ** k * sm - sm + suf[n]`. This formula is derived from the fact that the maximum subarray sum can be added multiple times, and the initial sum of the array is also considered.
   - The result is then adjusted to ensure it is within the modulo `10^9 + 7`.

6. **Modulo Adjustment**:
   - If the final sum `sm` is negative, it is adjusted by adding a multiple of `10^9 + 7` to make it positive.
   - If the final sum is positive, it is directly taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Correctness:
- The logic for calculating the prefix sums, minimum prefix sums, and the maximum subarray sum is correct.
- The formula for the final sum after `k` operations is mathematically sound.
- The modulo adjustment ensures that the result is within the required range.

However, there is a potential issue with the formula `2 ** k * sm - sm + suf[n]`. The term `2 ** k * sm` can become very large, leading to potential overflow issues. A more robust approach would be to use modular exponentiation to handle large powers efficiently.

### Modular Exponentiation:
- To handle large powers efficiently, we can use modular exponentiation. This involves computing `(2 ** k) % (10^9 + 7)` and then multiplying it by `sm` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Revised Code:
```python
def mod_exp(base, exp, mod):
    result = 1
    base = base % mod
    while exp > 0:
        if exp % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        exp = exp >> 1
        base = (base * base) % mod
    return result

def func():
    t = int(input())
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    for j in range(t):
        b = input().split()
        n = int(b[0])
        k = int(b[1])
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        suf = [0]
        for i in range(n):
            suf.append((suf[-1] + l[i]) % MOD)
        smin = [0]
        for i in range(n):
            if suf[i + 1] < smin[i]:
                smin.append(suf[i + 1])
            else:
                smin.append(smin[i])
        sm = -111
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if suf[i] - smin[i] > sm or sm == -111:
                sm = suf[i] - smin[i]
        sm = (mod_exp(2, k, MOD) * sm - sm + suf[n]) % MOD
        if sm < 0:
            sm += MOD
        print(sm)
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct but can be optimized by using modular exponentiation to handle large powers efficiently. The revised code ensures that the program remains correct and performs well even for large values of `k`.
