The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c` and the list `custos`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `custos`. If `custos` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `custos` has at least 1 element, and `c` is the first element in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, `custos` must have at least 2 elements, and `c` will be the second element in the list.

State: **`custos` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is the second element in the list `custos`**
