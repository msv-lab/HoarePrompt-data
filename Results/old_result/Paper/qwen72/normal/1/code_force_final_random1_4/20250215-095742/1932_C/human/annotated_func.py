#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n-1`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `a` in an order determined by the characters in `s` (if 'L', elements are taken from the left; if 'R', elements are taken from the right), `l` is `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', otherwise `l` is less than `n`, and `r` is `-1` if all characters in `s` are 'R', otherwise `r` is greater than or equal to 0.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n-1`, `b` is a non-empty list containing all elements from `a` in an order determined by the characters in `s`, `l` is `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', otherwise `l` is less than `n`, `r` is `-1` if all characters in `s` are 'R', otherwise `r` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of the elements in `b` modulo `m`, starting from the last element of `b` and moving towards the first, and `p` is the final value of the cumulative product modulo `m`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list `ans` in reverse order, where `ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of the elements in `b` modulo `m`, starting from the last element of `b` and moving towards the first. The final value of the cumulative product modulo `m` is stored in `p`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'). It processes the list `a` based on the characters in `s` to create a new list `b` where elements are taken from the start or end of `a` depending on whether the corresponding character in `s` is 'L' or 'R'. The function then computes the cumulative product of the elements in `b` modulo `m`, starting from the last element of `b` and moving towards the first. The result is returned as a list in reverse order, representing the cumulative product values.
