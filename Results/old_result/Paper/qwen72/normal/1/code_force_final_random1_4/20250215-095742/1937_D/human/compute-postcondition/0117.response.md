Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the character at index 0 of `s` is not '>', and `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`: If `l` is 0, no further changes occur. If `l` is not 0, `a` is the element at index `l - 1` of `A` plus `(0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - idx_B[r - l] * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 0) * l` if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `b` is the element at index `r` of `B` plus `(idx_B[r] - 0) * l`. If `l` is greater than `r`: If `r` is 0, no further changes occur. Otherwise, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, and if `l - r - 1 > 0`, `b` is the value of `A[l - 1]` minus `A[l - r - 2]` minus `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` minus `idx_A[l - 1] * (r + 1)`. If `l - r - 1 <= 0`, `b` is the value of `A[l - 1]` minus `idx_A[l - 1] * (r + 1)`.***
