Reasoning:  
The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of calculating the time taken for a car to reach certain points on a number line, based on known positions and times. The program uses binary search (via `bisect_left`) to efficiently find the segment in which each query point lies and then calculates the time based on the speed within that segment. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`, followed by the lists `a` and `b` which represent the known positions and times, respectively.

2. **Speed Calculation**: The program calculates the speed for each segment between known points. This is done by computing the differences in positions (`ad`) and times (`bd`), and then dividing these differences to get the speed (`v`).

3. **Query Processing**: For each query `d`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment in which `d` lies. If `d` is exactly at one of the known points, the corresponding time is directly printed. Otherwise, the program calculates the time by adding the time to reach the start of the segment and the additional time to reach `d` within the segment.

4. **Output**: The calculated time for each query is printed, rounded down to the nearest integer.

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem description. It ensures that the time is calculated accurately for each query, and the use of `bisect_left` makes the solution efficient even for large inputs.
