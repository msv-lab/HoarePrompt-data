Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n // 2`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement after the if block.***
