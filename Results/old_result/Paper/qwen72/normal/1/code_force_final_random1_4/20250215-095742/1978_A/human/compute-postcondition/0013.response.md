Output State: **`t` must be equal to the initial value of `t`, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the last input.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` must be equal to the initial value of `t`:** The total number of iterations is determined by the initial value of `t`. After all iterations, `t` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`_` is `t-1`:** The loop variable `_` increments with each iteration, starting from 0. After `t` iterations, `_` will be `t-1`.
- **`n` is an input integer:** For each iteration, `n` is read as an input integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`.
- **`nums` is a list of integers from the last input:** In the final iteration, `nums` will contain the list of integers read during the last iteration of the loop.
