The given code snippet updates the value of `sm` using the formula `sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm`. Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` must be at least 0.
   - All other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, `suf`) retain their initial values and conditions.
   - `sm` is updated to the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code `sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm` is executed.
   - This can be simplified to `sm = (2 ** k - 1) * sm`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The value of `sm` is updated to `(2 ** k - 1) * sm`.
   - All other variables (`smin`, `i`, `n`, `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, `suf`) remain unchanged.

4. **Output State**:
   - `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` must be at least 0.
   - `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, and `suf` retain their initial values and conditions.
   - `sm` is now equal to `(2 ** k - 1) * sm`.

Output State: **`smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 0, `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, and `suf` retain their initial values and conditions, `sm` is now equal to `(2 ** k - 1) * sm`.**
