#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, m is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and queries is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. Additionally, for each city, the closest city is unique, and the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `i` is `t`, which is the total number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is the input integer representing the number of cities, `l` is the list of distances between cities, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 2 to `n` inclusive, storing the minimum distance to the next city from the left, and `d2` is a defaultdict with keys ranging from 1 to `n-1` inclusive, storing the minimum distance to the next city from the right. `m` is the input integer representing the number of queries, and for each query, `x` and `y` are the indices of the cities provided by the user. The values of `d1` and `d2` are updated based on the conditions specified in the loop, and the results of the queries are printed accordingly.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of cities with unique positions and a series of queries. For each test case, it calculates and stores the minimum distance to the next city from both directions (left and right). It then answers each query by providing the difference in these stored distances between two specified cities. The function reads inputs from standard input and prints the results of the queries to standard output.
