The code reads a line from standard input (`stdin`), strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the resulting string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. This list is then assigned to the variable `command`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line.**
