The code snippet `c.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. The value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, but its addition to `c` changes the content of `c`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 3 elements.
- `x` is the third element in the list `l`.
- `i` is increased by the value of `x`.
- If `x` == 1, `p` is a list containing elements [0, 2, 2, i] and `c` is a list containing elements [0, 3, 3].
- Otherwise, `p` is a list containing elements [0, 0, 0, i] and `c` is a list containing elements [0, 1, 1].

After executing `c.append(j)`, the value of `j` is appended to the list `c`. The new state of `c` depends on the value of `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list `l`, `i` is increased by the value of `x`, `p` is a list containing elements [0, 2, 2, i] if `x` == 1, otherwise `p` is a list containing elements [0, 0, 0, i], `c` is a list containing elements [0, 3, 3, j] if `x` == 1, otherwise `c` is a list containing elements [0, 1, 1, j].**
