Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers â‰¥ 1, `t` is `t + 2`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, and the integer `i` (which is 1) is present in both lists `a` and `b`. If `aOnes` < `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 0. Otherwise, `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1.***
