To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition Breakdown:**
   - The loop will continue as long as both conditions are true:
     - `i < len(a)`
     - `a[i] == b[i]`

2. **Current State:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `a[0] == b[0]` (This is given and does not affect the next iteration directly)

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `a` and the elements at index `i` in `a` and `b` must be equal.

4. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - `i` is currently 1, so the next value of `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(a)`, so `len(a)` must be greater than 2.
   - Additionally, `a[1]` must be equal to `b[1]`.

### Conclusion:
- The state of `i` is already set to 1, which is correct for the next iteration.
- The length of `a` must be greater than 2 to ensure `i` can increment to 2 without violating the condition `i < len(a)`.
- The elements `a[1]` and `b[1]` must be equal to satisfy `a[i] == b[i]`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `new` is a list with the first element being `max(a[0], b[0])` and the rest being `None` values, `new2` is a list where the first element is `min(a[0], b[0])` and the rest are `None` values, `i` is 1, `a[0] == b[0]`, `len(a) > 2`, and `a[1] == b[1]`**
