The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is controlled by the `range(int(input()))` expression. For the loop to execute, the input provided to `range()` must be a positive integer. This means the user must input a value greater than 0.

Given the initial state, the variable `t` is already constrained to be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, which ensures that the input will be a valid positive integer. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to `t` itself. However, since the loop's execution depends on the user input, we need to ensure that the user input is a positive integer.

Since the loop's execution is solely dependent on the user input, and the initial state already ensures that `t` is within the required range, the only adjustment needed is to clarify that the user input must be a positive integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, the grid is represented by n lines of n characters, where each character is either '0' or '1', the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an empty list, the user input must be a positive integer**
