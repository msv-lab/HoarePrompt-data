Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the array a and the number of operations, respectively. a is a list of n integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the array a. The sum of the values of n and k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(t):
    b = input().split()
    n = int(b[0])
    k = int(b[1])
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    suf = []
    suf.append(0)
    for i in range(n):
        suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])
    smin = [0]
    for i in range(n):
        if suf[i + 1] < smin[i]:
            smin.append(suf[i + 1])
        else:
            smin.append(smin[i])
    sm = -111
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if suf[i] - smin[i] > sm or sm == -111:
            sm = suf[i] - smin[i]
    sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm
    sm += suf[n]
    if sm < 0:
        a = abs(sm) // (10 ** 9 + 7)
        sm += (a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)
    else:
        sm = sm % (10 ** 9 + 7)
    print(sm)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `suf` and the corresponding element in `l`, `i` is `n + 1`, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value of the suffix sums up to that index in `suf`. If `sm` is less than 0, `sm` is updated to `suf[n] + 2 + (a + 1) * (10`. Otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(suf[n] + 2) % (10`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 0, `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, and `suf` retain their initial values and conditions. If `sm` is less than 0, `sm` is now equal to `2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * (10`. Otherwise, `sm` is now equal to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *After all iterations of the loop, `smin` remains a list containing `2 * n + 1` elements with the first element being 0. Each subsequent element in `smin` is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index. `i` is `n`, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be at least the number of iterations. `t` retains its initial value and conditions. `j` is `j + 1`. `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input. `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`. `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input. `suf` is now `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l[:n])]`. If `sm` is less than 0, `sm` is updated to `-x + (x / 10 + 1) * 1000000007` where `x` is the absolute value of the original `sm`, and `a` is the absolute value of the original `sm` divided by 10. Otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % 1000000007`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
