Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is the number of unique integers in `arr` and must be greater than 3, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by a 0, `i` is 3, `dp` is `True` if `arr[3] - arr[4] > 1` or if the original `dp` was `True`, otherwise `dp` is `False`.**
