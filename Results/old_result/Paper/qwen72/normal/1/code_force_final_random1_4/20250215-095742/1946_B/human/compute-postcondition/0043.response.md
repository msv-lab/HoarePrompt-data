Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `suf` and the corresponding element in `l`, `i` is `n + 1`, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the minimum value of the suffix sums up to that index in `suf`, `sm` is the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `i` has reached the value `n + 1`.
- The variable `sm` now holds the maximum value of the difference between the suffix sum `suf[i]` and the minimum suffix sum `smin[i]` for all indices `i` from 0 to `n`.
- All other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `suf`, and `smin`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
