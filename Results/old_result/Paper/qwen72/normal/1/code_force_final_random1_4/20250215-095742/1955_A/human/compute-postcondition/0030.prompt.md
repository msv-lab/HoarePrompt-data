You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30, where n is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, a is the price for one yogurt, and b is the price for two yogurts on promotion.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `t - 1`, and the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` for each test case are processed according to the conditions in the loop. For each test case, if `B * 2 < C`, the output is `A * B`. If `A` is even, the output is `int(A * C / 2)`. If `A` is odd, the output is `X * C + B` where `X = A // 2`. The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` for each test case are reset for the next iteration, and the loop processes `t` test cases in total.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, the number of yogurts `n`, the price for one yogurt `a`, and the price for two yogurts on promotion `b`. It returns the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
