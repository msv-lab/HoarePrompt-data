Postcondition: **`n` is `previous[b]` and its current value is `-1`. `_` is the second value returned by `bfs(0)`. `u` and `v` are the last integers read from the input and each decreased by 1. `u2vs` is a list of lists where each list contains the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex. `d` is the first value returned by `bfs(a)`. `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.**
