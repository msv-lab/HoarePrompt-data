The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ai` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If `a` has more elements, the loop will continue to the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `year` is `ai`, and `ai` is the first element in the list `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `a` must have at least 2 elements. After the first iteration, `ai` will now be the second element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `year` is the second element in the list `a`, `ai` is the second element in the list `a`**
