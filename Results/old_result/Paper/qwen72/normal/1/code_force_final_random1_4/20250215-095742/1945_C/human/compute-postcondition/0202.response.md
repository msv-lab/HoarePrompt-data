Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `mini` will be the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`. The variable `ele` will be the last element processed from `lst`. The list `final` will contain all elements from `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini`. All other variables (`s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `n`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `i`, `lst`) remain unchanged.**

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `mini` will hold the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`. The variable `ele` will hold the last element that was processed from `lst`. The list `final` will contain all elements from `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` exactly equal to `mini`. All other variables that were not modified within the loop will retain their original values.
