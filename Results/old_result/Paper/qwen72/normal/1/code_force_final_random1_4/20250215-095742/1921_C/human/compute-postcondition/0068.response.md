Postcondition: **`array2` contains all the results of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is met. `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the same as in the initial state, `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `feat` is a list of integers from the new input, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, and `arr` is a list of integers. The sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`.**
