The code `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the value at the index `b[i]` in the list `cnt_b` by 1. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `b` is a list of integers read from a new input.
- `i` is 0.
- `m` must be greater than 0.

Since `i` is 0, the first element of `b` (i.e., `b[0]`) is used as the index in `cnt_b`. The value at this index in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from a new input, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1.**
