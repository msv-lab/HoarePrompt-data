Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of finding the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play their game optimally. The key points to consider are:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics**: Alice tries to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob tries to minimize it. This means Alice will always try to pick elements that help in achieving a higher MEX, and Bob will try to disrupt this by picking elements that prevent Alice from achieving her goal.

2. **Algorithm Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each number in the input array `arr`.
   - It initializes `start` to 0, which represents the current MEX candidate.
   - The loop continues until the current MEX candidate (`start`) is no longer present in the `Counter` (i.e., it has been fully processed).
   - In each iteration, it adds the current MEX candidate to a set `vis` and decrements its count in the `Counter`.
   - If the next integer (`start + 1`) is also present in the `Counter`, it decrements its count and increments `start`.
   - If the next integer (`start + 1`) is not present, it prints `start + 1` and returns, indicating that `start + 1` is the MEX of the array `c`.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - The algorithm correctly simulates the optimal play by ensuring that Alice and Bob make moves that lead to the highest possible MEX for Alice and the lowest possible MEX for Bob.
   - The use of the `Counter` and the set `vis` ensures that the algorithm efficiently tracks the elements and their counts, allowing it to determine the MEX correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when the input array contains only one element or when all elements are the same.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the input array is already a sequence of consecutive integers starting from 0.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
