To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case is `i` and `n`.

### Current State:
- `smin` is a list containing `2 * n + 1` elements with the first element being 0. Each subsequent element in `smin` is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be at least 1.
- `t` retains its initial value and conditions.
- `j` is `j + 1`.
- `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input.
- `suf` is now `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l[:n])]`.
- `sm` is set based on the condition: If `suf[i] - smin[i]` is greater than `sm` or `sm` is equal to `-111`, then `sm` is set to `l[0]` if `l[0]` is non-negative; otherwise, `sm` is set to 0. Otherwise, `sm` retains its initial value of `2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * 10`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
4. **Condition Check**: The loop will execute again if `i < n + 1`. Since `n` is at least 1, `n + 1` is at least 2. Therefore, the loop will execute again if `i` is 2.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2.
- `n` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop head.

### Final State:
State: **`smin` is a list containing `2 * n + 1` elements with the first element being 0. Each subsequent element in `smin` is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index. `i` is 2. `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be at least 1. `t` retains its initial value and conditions. `j` is `j + 1`. `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input. `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`. `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input. `suf` is now `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l[:n])]`. `sm` is set based on the condition: If `suf[i] - smin[i]` is greater than `sm` or `sm` is equal to `-111`, then `sm` is set to `l[0]` if `l[0]` is non-negative; otherwise, `sm` is set to 0. Otherwise, `sm` retains its initial value of `2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * 10`.**
