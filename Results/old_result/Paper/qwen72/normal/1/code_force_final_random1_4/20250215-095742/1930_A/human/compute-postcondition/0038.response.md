The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts a number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. The function processes these inputs to produce an output.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- A list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, representing the numbers written on the whiteboard.

The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, but typically, such a function would return a result for each test case based on the processing of the list of integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts a number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
