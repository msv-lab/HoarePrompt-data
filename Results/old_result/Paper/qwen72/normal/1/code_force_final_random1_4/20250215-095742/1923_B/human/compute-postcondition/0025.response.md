Output State: **`delta` is the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `rest` is now `rest - delta - delta`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`, `x` is a list of integers, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is the length of `a` and `x`, `sorted_indices` is a list of indices sorted based on the absolute values of the corresponding elements in `x`, `distance` is 0, `len(sorted_indices) > 0`, the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` or `x[sorted_indices[pos-2]]` (depending on the condition) is not equal to `distance`, and `pos` is incremented by 1 if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
