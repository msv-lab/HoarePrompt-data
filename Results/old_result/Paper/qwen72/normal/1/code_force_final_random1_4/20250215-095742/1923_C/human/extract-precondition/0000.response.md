Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; c is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; queries is a list of q pairs (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
