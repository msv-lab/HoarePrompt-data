Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`. If `com` is ".Q", `allPlayers[obj]` is `True`. If `com` is ".S", `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is incremented by 10. If `com` is neither ".Q" nor ".S", the state remains unchanged. If `len(command) != 3`, an error occurs due to incorrect unpacking, and `pos` and `nxt` are not assigned. If `obj` is equal to ".B" and `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is a player, `player` is set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`. If `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `team` is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)` and `points[team]` is increased by 1. If `com` is not 'T' and `isPlayer(obj)` is true, an additional error occurs when attempting to assign `nxt` to `elements[obj]` because `nxt` is not defined. Otherwise, no further assignment is attempted.***
