Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the new input string, `k` is 1, `best` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<` if any input was `<`, otherwise `best` remains 0**

Explanation:
- The variable `res` is updated to the new input string provided by the user.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `i`, `k`, `best`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
