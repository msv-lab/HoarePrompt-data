To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop head:

- The loop head is: `for _ in range(func_10()):`
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
  - `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0.
  - `_` is 0 (or not initialized).
  - The return value of `func_14()` has been printed to the standard output.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0. This condition must remain true for the loop to continue.
2. **Loop Variable**: The variable `_` is used as a dummy variable in the loop. It is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs, but it is not used within the loop body. Therefore, its value does not affect the loop's execution.
3. **Function Call**: `func_10()` is called at the start of each iteration to determine the number of iterations remaining. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must still return a value greater than 0.

### Adjustments:
- Since `_` is a dummy variable, it does not need to be adjusted.
- The condition that `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0 must still hold true for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
- `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0.
- `_` is 0 (or not initialized) and will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, but this does not affect the loop's condition.
- The return value of `func_14()` has been printed to the standard output (this remains unchanged).

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, `_` is 0 (or not initialized), and the return value of `func_14()` has been printed to the standard output.**
