To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop condition:

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `_` is 0
- `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input
- `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input
- `new` is a list where each element up to the point where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]` or `i-1` reaches the end of the list is `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])` and the rest are `None` values
- `new2` is a list where each element up to the point where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]` or `i-1` reaches the end of the list is `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])` and the rest are `None` values
- `i` is the index where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]` or the length of `a` if all elements are equal
- `a[j] == b[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i-2`
- The value of `new[i-1]` is `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])`
- The value of `new2[i-1]` is `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`

### Loop Condition:
```
while i < len(a):
```

### Analysis:
- The loop condition `i < len(a)` must be true for the loop to execute at least once.
- The variable `i` is the index where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]` or the length of `a` if all elements are equal.
- For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.
- If `i` is already equal to `len(a)`, the loop will not execute.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes at least once, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.
- Since `i` is defined as the index where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]` or the length of `a` if all elements are equal, we need to ensure that there is at least one index where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]`.

### Conclusion:
- The state of `i` must be adjusted to ensure it is less than `len(a)`.
- If `a` and `b` are identical lists, `i` would be equal to `len(a)`, and the loop would not execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `a` and `b` are not identical up to the last element.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `new` is a list where each element up to the point where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]` or `i-1` reaches the end of the list is `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])` and the rest are `None` values, `new2` is a list where each element up to the point where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]` or `i-1` reaches the end of the list is `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])` and the rest are `None` values, `i` is the index where `a[i-1] != b[i-1]` and `i` must be less than `len(a)`, and `a[j] == b[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i-2`. The value of `new[i-1]` is `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, and the value of `new2[i-1]` is `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`.**
