The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might internally use or generate values for `n` and `m`, where both `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The output of the function is not specified, so we cannot determine what the function returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It is implied that it may internally use or generate values for `n` and `m`, where both `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. The specific return value of the function is not provided.**
