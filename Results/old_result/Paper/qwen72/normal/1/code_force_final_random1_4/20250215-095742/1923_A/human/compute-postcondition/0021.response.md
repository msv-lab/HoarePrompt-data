Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1`), `n` is a new input integer, `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found (specifically, `y` is now the length of `arr` minus 1 minus the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`), `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.**

Explanation:
- `z` is updated to be the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
