Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order. If `x` is 0, `results` contains 'YES' and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
