Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `m-1`, `m` remains the same as the input integer, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `m-1`. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. `b_values` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `b`.**
