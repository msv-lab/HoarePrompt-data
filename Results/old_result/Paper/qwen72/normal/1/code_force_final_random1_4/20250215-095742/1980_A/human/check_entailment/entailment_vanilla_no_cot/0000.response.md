Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It processes each test case by counting the frequency of each difficulty level in the given set of problems, then calculates how many additional problems are needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds. The solution correctly accounts for the fact that each round requires one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). The final output matches the expected results for the given example, indicating that the program functions as intended.
