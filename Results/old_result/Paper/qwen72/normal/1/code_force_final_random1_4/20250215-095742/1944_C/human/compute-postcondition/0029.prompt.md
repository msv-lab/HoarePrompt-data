Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is the length of the list `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object containing the counts of each integer in `arr`. `start` is 0. `vis` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
while nums.get(start, 0):
    vis.add(start)
    nums[start] -= 1
    if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
        nums[start + 1] -= 1
        start += 1
    else:
        print(start + 1)
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is the length of the list `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object containing the counts of each integer in `arr`, with the count of `arr[0]` decreased by 1 and the count of `1` decreased by 1. `start` is 1. `vis` is a set containing the element 0. The count of `1` in `nums` is now greater than or equal to 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is the length of the list `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object containing the counts of each integer in `arr`, with the count of `arr[0]` decreased by 1, the count of `1` decreased by 1, and the count of `start` (which is 1) further decreased by 1. `start` is 1. `vis` is a set containing the elements 0 and 1. The count of `1` in `nums` is now greater than or equal to -1. If `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is true, then `nums` has the count of 2 decreased by 1, `start` is updated to 2, and `vis` remains unchanged. If `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is false, the program does not return any value and the state remains as described in the precondition.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is the length of the list `arr`. `nums` is a Counter object containing the counts of each integer in `arr`, with the count of `arr[0]` decreased by 1, the count of `1` decreased by 2, and the count of `start` (which is 1) further decreased by 1. `start` is 1. `vis` is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 1. The count of `1` in `nums` must be greater than 0. If `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is true, then the count of `1` in `nums` is decreased by 3, and `start` is updated to 2. Otherwise, the program does not return any value.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
