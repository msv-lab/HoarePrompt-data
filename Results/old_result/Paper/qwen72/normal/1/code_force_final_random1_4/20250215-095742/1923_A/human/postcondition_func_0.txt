The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers (0s and 1s) representing the state of a ribbon. The function then calculates and prints the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s) in the ribbon for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.
