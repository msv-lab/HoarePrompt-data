Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the year when the n-th sign will occur, following the rules specified in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the solution works:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case:
   - It reads the number of signs `n`.
   - It reads the list of periodicities `a` for the signs.
   - It initializes `year` to 0, which will keep track of the current year.

3. **Calculate the Year for Each Sign**:
   - For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, the function updates the `year` by adding the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than the current `year`.
   - This is achieved using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`:
     - `year % ai` gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`.
     - If `year % ai` is 0, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, so `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `ai`.
     - If `year % ai` is not 0, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, so `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `year % ai`.
     - Adding `year % ai or ai` to `year` ensures that `year` is updated to the next multiple of `ai` that is greater than the current `year`.

4. **Output the Result**: After processing all signs for a test case, the function prints the final `year`.

This approach ensures that the signs occur sequentially and strictly after the previous sign, as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the solution is correct.
