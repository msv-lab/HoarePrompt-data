Reasoning:

The function `func` aims to determine if it's possible to make all squares in a grid the same color using the specified operations. The key logic in the function is to check if the top-left cell (`gr[0][0]`) is different from the bottom-right cell (`gr[n-1][m-1]`). If they are different, the function further checks if all cells in the first and last rows are the same, and all cells in the first and last columns are the same. If both conditions are met, it sets `ans` to 'NO'. Otherwise, it sets `ans` to 'YES'.

However, there is a logical flaw in the function. The function incorrectly concludes that it is impossible to make all cells the same color if the top-left and bottom-right cells are different and all cells in the first and last rows and columns are the same. This is not always true. For example, consider a grid where the top-left and bottom-right cells are different, but the rest of the grid can still be made uniform through operations.

To illustrate, consider the following grid:
```
W B W
B W B
W B W
```
Here, the top-left cell is 'W' and the bottom-right cell is 'W', but the grid can be made entirely 'W' or 'B' through operations. However, the function would incorrectly output 'NO' because it only checks the first and last rows and columns.

A correct approach would be to check if there is at least one 'W' and one 'B' in the entire grid. If both 'W' and 'B' are present, it is impossible to make all cells the same color. If only one color is present, it is possible.

Given this, the function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
