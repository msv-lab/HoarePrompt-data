Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the integer provided by the user input, `m` is the integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` user input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, `impossible` is True if all adjacent strings in `gr` have the same first and last characters. Otherwise, `impossible` is False. `ans` is 'NO'.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n-1` times, where `n` is the length of the list `gr`.
- After each iteration, the value of `i` increases by 1, starting from 0 and ending at `n-2`.
- The variable `impossible` is set to False if any two adjacent strings in `gr` have different first or last characters.
- If all adjacent strings in `gr` have the same first and last characters, `impossible` remains True.
- The variables `t`, `tc`, `m`, `gr`, and `ans` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.
