Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, `sa` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `a[j] > 0` and `b[j] == 0`, plus any indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where both `a[j]` and `b[j]` are 0, `sb` is a list containing all indices `j` (1 ≤ j ≤ n) where `b[j] > 0` and `a[j] == 0`, the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, `j` is 1. If the character at index 0 of `xx[2]` is not '?', then `nx` is a string containing the first character of `xx[2]`. Otherwise, if either `i` (which is 2) or `j` (which is 1) is in the first quarter of `sa`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.***
