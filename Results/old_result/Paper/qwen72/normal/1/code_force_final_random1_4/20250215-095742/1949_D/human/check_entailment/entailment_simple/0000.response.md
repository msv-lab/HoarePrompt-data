Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of assigning types (funny or scary) to undetermined transition videos between scenarios in a way that ensures no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are shown, regardless of the order in which scenarios are played.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of scenarios \( n \) and the initial transition matrix.
   - It initializes lists `a` and `b` to count the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each scenario, respectively.
   - It stores the input matrix in `xx`.

2. **Counting Existing Transitions:**
   - The program iterates through the input matrix to populate `a` and `b` with counts of 'F' and 'S' transitions.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Only One Type of Transition:**
   - It creates lists `sa` and `sb` to store scenarios that have only 'F' or only 'S' transitions, respectively.

4. **Handling Undecided Transitions:**
   - If the number of scenarios with only 'F' transitions (`sa`) is greater than or equal to those with only 'S' transitions (`sb`), it assigns 'F' to the first quarter of these scenarios and 'S' to the rest.
   - Conversely, if the number of scenarios with only 'S' transitions is greater, it assigns 'S' to the first quarter of these scenarios and 'F' to the rest.

5. **Outputting the Final Matrix:**
   - The program constructs and prints the final transition matrix, ensuring that the conditions are met.

### Analysis:
- **Symmetry and Diagonal Handling:**
  - The program correctly handles the symmetry of the matrix and the diagonal (no transitions).

- **Consecutive Transitions Constraint:**
  - The program ensures that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are shown by strategically assigning 'F' and 'S' to the first quarter of scenarios with only one type of transition.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases where some scenarios have no transitions yet (both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0) by appending these scenarios to `sa` or `sb` as needed.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It ensures that the transition videos meet the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type, and it handles the input and output formats correctly.

Correctness: **True**
