Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]` and is greater than 0, `idx` is increased by `n + 3 * q + 3`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `a[1]` which is set to the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair `{(0): [0]}`, `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, and an additional empty string.**

Explanation:
- `idx` was initially increased by `n + 3 * q + 2`.
- The code `idx += 1` increments `idx` by 1, so the total increment of `idx` is now `n + 3 * q + 3`.
- The value of `n` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` because `idx` has been incremented by 1.
- The value of `q` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 2]` because `idx` has been incremented by 1.
- The value of `a[1]` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` because `idx` has been incremented by 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
