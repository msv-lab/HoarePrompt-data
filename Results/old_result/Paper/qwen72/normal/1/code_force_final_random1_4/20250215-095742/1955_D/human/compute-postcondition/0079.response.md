The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `b_values`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `b_values` list. If `b_values` contains more elements, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `b_values` must contain at least one element, `i` is an element from `b_values`, and `cnt_b[i]` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `b_values` must contain at least two elements, and `i` will be the next element in `b_values`.

State: **`b_values` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the next element from `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0.**
