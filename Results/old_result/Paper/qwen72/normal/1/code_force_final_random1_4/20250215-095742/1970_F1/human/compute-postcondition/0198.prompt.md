You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both n and m are odd.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, stdin.readline().strip().split())
    grid = []
    elements = {'.B': (-1, -1)}
    allPlayers = {}
    goal = [[], []]
    points = [0, 0]
    for i in range(n):
        line = stdin.readline().strip().split()

                if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                    allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
                elif line[ind][1] == 'G':

                    goal[tmp].append((i, ind))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, the following state is reached:
    t = int(stdin.readline().strip())
    for time in range(t):
        comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
        
        if len(comand) == 3:
            obj, com, el = comand
            if el == '.Q':
                allPlayers[obj] = True
            elif el == '.S':
                team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
                points[team] += 10
                print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))

            pos = elements[obj]
            nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
            if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
                ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
                player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
                print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
            elif com == 'T':
                allPlayers[obj] = False
                if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                    team = goalIn(pos)
                    print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                    points[team] += 1
            elif isPlayer(obj):
                elements[obj] = nxt
            if obj == '.B':
                elements[obj] = nxt
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` is 0, as the loop has completed its execution based on the initial value of `t`. The variable `time` will have reached the value of `t - 1` (the last iteration index). The dictionary `allPlayers` will contain the final state of players, where each key is a player identifier and the value is a boolean indicating whether the player is active (`True`) or inactive (`False`). The list `points` will contain the final scores for each team, with `points[0]` representing the score for Team 0 and `points[1]` representing the score for Team 1. The dictionary `elements` will contain the final positions of all objects, including players and the ball, with each key being an object identifier and the value being a tuple representing the coordinates of the object. The grid `grid` will reflect the final state of the game board, with the positions of players and the ball updated according to the commands executed during the loop.
    print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
    #This is printed: FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where [points[0]] is the final score for Team 0 and [points[1]] is the final score for Team 1)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters but internally uses two odd integers `n` and `m` within the range 3 to 99. It returns a result based on these values, though the specific output is not specified.
