To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
```

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be at least 5
- `i` is 5
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3
- `dp[3]` is 7
- `dp[4]` is 25

We need to compute the new value of `dp[i]` where `i` is 5.

1. Calculate `dp[i - 1]`:
   - `dp[4]` is 25

2. Calculate `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]`:
   - `i - 1` is 4
   - `dp[3]` is 7
   - `2 * 4 * 7` is 56

3. Add the results:
   - `25 + 56` is 81

4. Apply the modulo operation:
   - `81 % 1000000007` is 81

Therefore, the new value of `dp[5]` is 81.

The output state is:
- `n` must be at least 5
- `i` is 5
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3
- `dp[3]` is 7
- `dp[4]` is 25
- `dp[5]` is 81

Output State: **`n` must be at least 5, `i` is 5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, `dp[5]` is 81**
