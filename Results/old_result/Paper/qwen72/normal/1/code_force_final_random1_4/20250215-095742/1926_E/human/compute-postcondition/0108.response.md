Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. It processes each test case to compute and print a specific value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. Specifically, it divides `n` into parts and uses these parts to determine a value that is printed if certain conditions are met. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly to the standard output. After processing all test cases, the function completes without modifying the initial value of `t`, and the internal variables used for computation (`n`, `k`, `L`, `tot`, `pow`) are reset for each test case. **
