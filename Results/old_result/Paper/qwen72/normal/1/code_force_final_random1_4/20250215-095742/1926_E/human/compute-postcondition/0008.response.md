The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` was updated to `n - n // 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be non-zero after this update.

Given that `n` is updated to `n - n // 2`, this means `n` is halved (rounded down). For `n` to be non-zero after this operation, `n` must have been greater than 1 before the update. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 before the update to ensure it remains non-zero after the update.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the value `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
