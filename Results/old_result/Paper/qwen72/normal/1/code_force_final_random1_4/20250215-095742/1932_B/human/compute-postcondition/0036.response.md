To determine what will be printed by the `print(year)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 999\).
   - `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
   - `a` is a list of integers with exactly `n` elements.
   - `year` is the sum of the elements in the list `a` where each element `ai` contributes either `ai` or `year % ai` if `year % ai` is non-zero.

2. **Understanding the Calculation of `year`:**
   - The value of `year` is determined by iterating through each element `ai` in the list `a`.
   - For each `ai`, if `year % ai` is zero, `ai` is added to `year`.
   - If `year % ai` is non-zero, `year % ai` is added to `year`.

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - Initialize `year` to 0.
   - For each `ai` in the list `a`:
     - Compute `year % ai`.
     - If `year % ai` is zero, add `ai` to `year`.
     - If `year % ai` is non-zero, add `year % ai` to `year`.

4. **Final Value of `year`:**
   - The final value of `year` is the sum of contributions from each element in the list `a` based on the rules described above.

Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `year`. However, based on the given conditions, the `print(year)` statement will output the calculated value of `year`.

Output: **year (where year is the sum of the elements in the list `a` where each element `ai` contributes either `ai` or `year % ai` if `year % ai` is non-zero)**
