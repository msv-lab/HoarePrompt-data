Postcondition: ***`q` is greater than 0, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 4]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `idx` is increased by 2, and `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` is 0, `results` contains 'YES' and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
