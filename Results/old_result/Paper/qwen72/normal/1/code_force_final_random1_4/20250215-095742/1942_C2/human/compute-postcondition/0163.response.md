Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `ans` is `ans + gap`, `n`, `a`, `st`, `y` remain unchanged, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the first element of `odd`, `odd` is a sorted list in ascending order with at least one element, `even` is now sorted in ascending order, `y` is `y - (gap // 2)`**.

Explanation:
- The code `y -= gap // 2` subtracts half of the value of `gap` (integer division) from `y`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The new value of `y` is `y - (gap // 2)`.
