Output State: **All elements in `b_values` have been processed, `cnt_b[i]` is `0` for each unique element `i` in `b_values`, `n` is greater than `m`, and `i` is the last element in `b_values`.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has completed all its iterations, and for each unique element `i` in `b_values`, the value of `cnt_b[i]` has been set to `0`. The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged, with `n` still being greater than `m`. The variable `i` now holds the last element that was processed from `b_values`.
