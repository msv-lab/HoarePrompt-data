Postcondition: ***The loop will execute if `x` is at least 1. The initial value of `i` in the loop head is 1. The current value of `i` is such that `x % i == 0`. If `x - n * i` is non-negative and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
