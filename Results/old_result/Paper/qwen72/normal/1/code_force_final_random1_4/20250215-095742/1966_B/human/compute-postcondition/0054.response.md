Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the first integer provided by the user input, `m` is the second integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input from each iteration of the loop), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, `ans` remains 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` is still greater than 0.
- The variable `tc` remains 1.
- The variable `n` retains its original value as the first integer provided by the user.
- The variable `m` retains its original value as the second integer provided by the user.
- The list `gr` now contains `n` elements, with each element being the user input from each iteration of the loop.
- The variable `i` is now `n-1`, indicating the loop has run `n` times.
- The variable `j` remains `m-2`.
- The variable `ans` will be 'NO' if the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n-1][m-1]`). Otherwise, `ans` will be 'YES'.
