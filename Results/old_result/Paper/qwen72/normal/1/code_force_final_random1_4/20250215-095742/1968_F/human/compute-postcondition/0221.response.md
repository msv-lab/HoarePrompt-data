Postcondition: ***`q` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, all other variables remain unchanged. If `x` == 0, `results` now includes 'YES', and the program continues to the next iteration.***
