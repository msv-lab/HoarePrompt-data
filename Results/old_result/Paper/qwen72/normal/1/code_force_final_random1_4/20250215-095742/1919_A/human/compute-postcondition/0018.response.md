The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that references a variable named `result`. However, the initial state only mentions a list called `results` and does not define a variable named `result`.

Given the initial state:
- `results` is a list containing at least one element.

Since the variable `result` is not defined in the initial state, it is likely that there is a typo in the code snippet, and it should be `results` instead of `result`.

Assuming the intended code is:
```python
print(results)
```

The output will be the entire list `results`, which contains at least one element. Since the exact elements of the list are not specified, we can only describe the output in general terms.

Output: **[list of elements] (where the list contains at least one element)**
