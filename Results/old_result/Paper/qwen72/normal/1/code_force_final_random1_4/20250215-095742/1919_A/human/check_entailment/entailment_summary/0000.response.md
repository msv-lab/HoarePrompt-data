### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic implemented in `func_1` and `func_2` correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their own.
   - After deciding whether to swap, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game is essentially about the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob will always win because he can mirror Alice's moves.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, Alice will always win because she can force Bob into a losing position.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**:
     - This function checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
     - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
     - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
     - This logic aligns with the key insight that the parity of the total number of coins determines the winner.

   - **`func_2()`**:
     - This function handles multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `a` and `b`, calling `func_1(a, b)`, and storing the result.
     - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
     - This function correctly implements the input and output handling as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to handle multiple test cases and produce the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
