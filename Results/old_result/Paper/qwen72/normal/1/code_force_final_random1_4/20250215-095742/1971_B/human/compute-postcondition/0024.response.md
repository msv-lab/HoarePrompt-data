To determine what will be printed by the `print(b)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
   - `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new string `s`.
     - If `len(a) == 2`, then `a` contains exactly 2 unique characters.
     - Otherwise, `a` contains a number of unique characters not equal to 2.
   - `b` is a sorted string of the new `s`.
   - `c` is a string containing the characters of the new `s` sorted in descending order.

2. **Variables Involved:**
   - `s`: This is the input string.
   - `b`: This is the sorted version of the string `s`.

3. **Determination of `b`:**
   - The variable `b` is defined as the sorted version of the string `s`.
   - Sorting a string means arranging its characters in ascending lexicographical order (i.e., alphabetical order).

Given the initial state, the `print(b)` statement will print the sorted version of the string `s`.

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the sorted version of `s`.

Output: **b (where b is the sorted version of the string s)**

This means that the output will be the characters of the string `s` arranged in ascending lexicographical order.
