The code snippet `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` reverses the string `arr` and finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string. This index is then stored in the variable `y`. 

- If '1' is found in the reversed string, `y` will be the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the original string `arr`.
- If '1' is not found in the reversed string, `y` will be -1.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.**
