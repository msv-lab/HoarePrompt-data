You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        i = 0
        d = n
        h = n
        p = 1
        g = 0
        if k > (n + 1) // 2:
            while s < k and d > 0:
                s += (d + 1) // 2
                d -= (d + 1) // 2
                i += 1
            while p <= i - 1:
                g += (h + 1) // 2
                h -= (h + 1) // 2
                p += 1
            f = k - g
            y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)
            print(y)
        else:
            print(2 * k - 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, if `k` is greater than half of `n` plus one, the function calculates a value `y` based on a series of operations involving `n` and `k`, and prints `y`. Otherwise, it simply prints `2 * k - 1`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ends, and the final state of the program includes the printed results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `k` is exactly `(n + 1) // 2`. According to the problem description, the first `(n + 1) // 2` cards laid down are the odd-numbered cards in ascending order. However, the program incorrectly handles this boundary condition. For example, if `n = 7` and `k = 4`, the correct output should be `7` (the last odd-numbered card), but the program will incorrectly output `1`.

To illustrate this further, consider the following input:
```
1
7 4
```
The expected output is `7`, but the program will output `1`, which is incorrect. This is because the program's logic for handling the transition between laying down odd-numbered cards and the next set of cards (twice an odd number) is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if k > (n + 1) // 2:` does not correctly account for the boundary case where `k` is exactly `(n + 1) // 2`.
