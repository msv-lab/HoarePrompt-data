Output State: **`q` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` has been incremented by `2 * q_initial + 3`, `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, followed by an additional empty string, `n` must be at least 0, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `a[1]` which is now `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `pf[1]` is now `a[1]`, `mp` is a dictionary with key-value pairs `{(0): [0], a[1]: [1]}`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The line `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list associated with the key `pf[i]` (which is `a[1]`) in the dictionary `mp`.
- Before this line, `mp` was `{(0): [0], a[1]: []}`.
- After executing the line, `mp` becomes `{(0): [0], a[1]: [1]}`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
