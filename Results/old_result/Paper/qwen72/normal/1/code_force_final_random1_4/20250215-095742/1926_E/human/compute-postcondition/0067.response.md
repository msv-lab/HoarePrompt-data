Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by the total number of iterations and must still be less than `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is 0 or a non-positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is the last computed value of \((n + 1) // 2\) before `n` became 0 or non-positive, `L` is a list containing all the values of `m` computed during each iteration and must have at least three elements, `a` is the third element in `L`, `tot` is `a + a`, `pow` is 4. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, then the current value of `tot` is `a + a` and `k` is less than or equal to `a + a + a`. Otherwise, the values of `tot`, `k`, `a`, `m`, `L`, `n`, and `t` remain as they were before the if statement.**
