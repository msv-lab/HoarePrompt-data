The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition but operates under the context of processing multiple test cases. Each test case includes the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` and `m`: Integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.
  - `a`: A list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
  - `b`: A list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. The specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information, but it is implied that the function computes some form of outcome based on the given parameters for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of people in a queue (n), the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (m), and two lists of integers (a and b). It returns a result for each test case.**
