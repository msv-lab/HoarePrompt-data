The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the elements at index `i` of the lists `x`, `y`, and `r`. Given that `i` is 1, these new values will be assigned to `x[1]`, `y[1]`, and `r[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x[0]` is an input integer, `y[0]` is an input integer, `r[0]` is an input integer, `x[1]` is an input integer, `y[1]` is an input integer, `r[1]` is an input integer, `x[2:n]` are `None`, `y[2:n]` are `None`, `r[2:n]` are `None`, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`.**
