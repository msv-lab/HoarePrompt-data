Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop, `smin` remains a list containing `2 * n + 1` elements with the first element being 0. Each subsequent element in `smin` is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index. `i` is `n`, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be at least the number of iterations. `t` retains its initial value and conditions. `j` is `j + 1`. `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input. `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`. `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input. `suf` is now `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l[:n])]`. If `sm` is less than 0, `sm` is updated to `-x + (x / 10 + 1) * 1000000007` where `x` is the absolute value of the original `sm`, and `a` is the absolute value of the original `sm` divided by 10. Otherwise, `sm` is updated to `(2 + suf[n]) % 1000000007`.***
