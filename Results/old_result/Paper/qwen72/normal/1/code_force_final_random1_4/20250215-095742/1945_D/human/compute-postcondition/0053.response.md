The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into integers, storing them in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` and `pos_final` are integers provided by the user, `pos_final` is decreased by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers provided by the user, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs from `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` for each valid `v` from `na_frente` to 0, and `best` is the minimum value between the initial `best` (10^12) and the updated `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each valid `v`.**
