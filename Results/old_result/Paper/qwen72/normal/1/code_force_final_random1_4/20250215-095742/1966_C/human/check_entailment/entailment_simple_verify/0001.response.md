### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to remove `k` stones from each non-empty pile.
   - The value of `k` must be a positive integer and at most the size of the smallest non-empty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (all piles are empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - The key to determining the winner is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the number of distinct pile sizes.
   - If the number of distinct pile sizes is odd, Alice can always force a win by making the number of distinct pile sizes even after her turn.
   - Conversely, if the number of distinct pile sizes is even, Bob can always force a win by making the number of distinct pile sizes odd after his turn.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles `arr`.
   - It sorts the unique pile sizes in descending order and appends a zero to handle edge cases.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `dp` to `True`, which will be used to track the winning condition.
   - It iterates through the sorted unique pile sizes and updates `dp` based on the difference between consecutive pile sizes.
   - If the difference between consecutive pile sizes is greater than 1, or if `dp` is `False`, it toggles `dp`.
   - Finally, it prints "Alice" if `dp` is `True` and "Bob" otherwise.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the number of distinct pile sizes and uses this information to determine the winner.
   - The logic of toggling `dp` based on the difference between consecutive pile sizes ensures that the program correctly handles the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes.
   - The program handles the edge cases and input constraints as specified in the problem description.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
  - For each test case, it reads the number of piles and the pile sizes, ensuring that the input constraints are respected.

- **Unique Pile Sizes:**
  - The program uses `set` to ensure that only unique pile sizes are considered, which is crucial for the game logic.
  - Sorting the unique pile sizes in descending order and appending a zero helps in handling edge cases where the smallest pile size might be 1.

- **Winning Condition:**
  - The boolean variable `dp` is initialized to `True`, representing Alice's initial turn.
  - The loop iterates through the sorted unique pile sizes and updates `dp` based on the difference between consecutive pile sizes.
  - The condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp` correctly toggles `dp` based on the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes.
  - This ensures that the program correctly determines the winner based on the game logic.

- **Output:**
  - The program prints "Alice" if `dp` is `True` and "Bob" otherwise, which aligns with the game rules and the optimal play strategy.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

Final: **True**
