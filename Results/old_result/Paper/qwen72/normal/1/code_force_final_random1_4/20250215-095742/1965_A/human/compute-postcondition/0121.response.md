The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts no direct parameters but expects input in the form of multiple test cases. Each test case consists of:
- An integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns the result for each test case. However, the specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. It returns the result for each test case, though the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
