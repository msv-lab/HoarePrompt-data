To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 2.
- `_` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers from the new input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `nums[:-1]`**:
   - `nums[:-1]` is a slice of the list `nums` that includes all elements except the last one.
   - For example, if `nums = [1, 3, 5, 7]`, then `nums[:-1]` would be `[1, 3, 5]`.

2. **Finding `max(nums[:-1])`**:
   - `max(nums[:-1])` finds the maximum value in the sliced list `nums[:-1]`.
   - Continuing with the example, `max([1, 3, 5])` would be `5`.

3. **Accessing `nums[-1]`**:
   - `nums[-1]` is the last element of the list `nums`.
   - In the example, `nums[-1]` would be `7`.

4. **Calculating the Sum**:
   - The expression `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]` adds the maximum value of the sliced list to the last element of the list.
   - In the example, this would be `5 + 7`, which equals `12`.

### Final Output:
The code will print the sum of the maximum value of all elements in `nums` except the last one and the last element of `nums`.

Output: **max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1] (where max(nums[:-1]) is the maximum value of all elements in nums except the last one, and nums[-1] is the last element of nums)**

This output provides a precise description of what will be printed based on the given initial state and the code snippet.
