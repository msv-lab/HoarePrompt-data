Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `m` remain positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\). The value of `x` is still 1, and `y` is the smallest integer greater than 1 such that \((x + y) * x > n\) or \((x + y) * y > m\). The value of `cnt` is the sum of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs of `x` and `y` where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and the conditions \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\) are satisfied.**
