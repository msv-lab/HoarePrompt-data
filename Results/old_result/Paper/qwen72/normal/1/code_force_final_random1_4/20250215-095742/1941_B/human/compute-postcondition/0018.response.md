Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers from the input.

The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
