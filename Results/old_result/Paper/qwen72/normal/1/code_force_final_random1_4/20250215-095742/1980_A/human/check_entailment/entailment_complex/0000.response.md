Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles the input by iterating over the number of test cases (`t`). For each test case, it extracts the values `n`, `m`, and the string `a`.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: The function initializes a frequency array `freq` with 7 zeros, corresponding to the difficulties 'A' to 'G'. It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the appropriate index in `freq` based on the character's position in the alphabet.

3. **Missing Problems Calculation**: The function calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level by using the formula `max(0, m - f)` for each frequency `f` in `freq`. This ensures that if there are already enough problems of a certain difficulty, the value will be zero, and if there are not enough, it will calculate the difference.

4. **Result Collection**: The function appends the total number of missing problems to the `results` list for each test case.

5. **Output**: The function returns the `results` list, which contains the correct number of missing problems for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when there are no problems of a certain difficulty in the bank.

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
