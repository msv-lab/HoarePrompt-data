Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from its previous value), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of the new `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the string `arr`. If '1' is not found in `arr`, `x` is set to -1.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `y`, `z`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
