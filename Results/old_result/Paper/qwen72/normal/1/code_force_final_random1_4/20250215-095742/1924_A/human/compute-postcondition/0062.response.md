The code snippet `ans = ''` reassigns the variable `ans` to an empty string. This overrides the previous value of `ans`, which was a string containing the characters from the previous `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1 or `k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, and `cur` is 0.**
