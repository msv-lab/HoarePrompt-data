Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of deletions required to make a string beautiful by ensuring it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map". However, the current implementation only counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" and sums them up, which does not correctly address the problem. The issue lies in the fact that simply counting the occurrences of "map" and "pie" does not account for overlapping instances or the minimum deletions required to remove these substrings entirely.

For example, consider the string "mappppie". The program would count one occurrence of "map" and one occurrence of "pie", leading to a total of 2. However, to make the string beautiful, we need to remove at least 2 characters to eliminate both "map" and "pie". The correct approach should involve identifying the minimum deletions required to ensure no "map" or "pie" substrings remain, which may require more sophisticated logic than simple counting.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the minimum number of deletions needed to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
