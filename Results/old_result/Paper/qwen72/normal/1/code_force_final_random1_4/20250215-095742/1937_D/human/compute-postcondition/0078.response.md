Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the first character of `s` is '>', `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to the variable `b`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `s`, `l`, `r`, `a`) remain unchanged. The new state includes the updated value of `b` and retains all the conditions from the initial state.
