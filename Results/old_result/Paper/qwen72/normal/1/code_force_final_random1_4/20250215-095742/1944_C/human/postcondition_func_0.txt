The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr`, where each integer is within the range from 0 to the length of the list minus one. It processes the list to track and decrement the occurrences of certain integers based on a specific pattern. The function does not modify the original list `arr`. Instead, it uses a `Counter` object to keep track of the counts of integers in `arr` and a set `vis` to record the integers that have been processed. The function prints the last integer that was successfully processed and then terminates without returning any value.
