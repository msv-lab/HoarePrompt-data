### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine if it's possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using the specified operations. The key insight is that if there are any two squares of different colors that are not part of a continuous subrectangle of the same color, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform.

#### Program Analysis:
The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the grid and checks if the top-left cell (`gr[0][0]`) is different from the bottom-right cell (`gr[n-1][m-1]`). If they are different, it further checks if all cells in the first and last rows are the same, and all cells in the first and last columns are the same. If these conditions are met, it sets the answer to 'NO'. Otherwise, it sets the answer to 'YES'.

#### Function Summary:
- **Input:** Multiple test cases, each with an \( n \times m \) grid.
- **Output:** 'YES' if it's possible to make all squares the same color, 'NO' otherwise.
- **Logic:**
  - Check if the top-left and bottom-right cells are different.
  - If they are different, check if all cells in the first and last rows are the same, and all cells in the first and last columns are the same.
  - If both conditions are true, set the answer to 'NO'.
  - Otherwise, set the answer to 'YES'.

#### Counterexample Analysis:
The original assessment provides a counterexample:
```
2 2
WB
BW
```
- **Top-left cell:** `W`
- **Bottom-right cell:** `B`
- **First row:** `WB`
- **Last row:** `BW`
- **First column:** `W`
- **Last column:** `B`

The program will:
1. Check if `gr[0][0]` (W) is different from `gr[1][1]` (B). They are different.
2. Check if all cells in the first and last rows are the same. They are not.
3. Check if all cells in the first and last columns are the same. They are not.
4. Since neither condition is met, the program will output 'YES'.

However, this grid cannot be made uniform because there are no two squares of the same color that can form a subrectangle covering the entire grid. Therefore, the program's output is incorrect.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program's logic is flawed because it only checks the first and last rows and columns, which is insufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform. The counterexample provided in the original assessment clearly demonstrates this flaw.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
