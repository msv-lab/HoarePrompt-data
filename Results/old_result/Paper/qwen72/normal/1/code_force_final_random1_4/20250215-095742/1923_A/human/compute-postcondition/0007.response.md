To determine what will be printed by the `print(z.count('0'))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed.
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
   - `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
   - `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.

2. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - **`arr`**: This is the input string with all spaces removed.
   - **`x`**: The index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`. If '1' is not found, `x` is -1.
   - **`y`**: The index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`. If '1' is not found, `y` is -1.
   - **`z`**: The substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.

3. **Substring Calculation:**
   - If `x` is -1 (i.e., '1' is not found in `arr`), then `z` will be an empty string because the starting index is invalid.
   - If `x` is valid (i.e., '1' is found), then `z` will be the substring from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.

4. **Counting '0's in `z`:**
   - If `z` is an empty string, `z.count('0')` will be 0.
   - If `z` is a non-empty string, `z.count('0')` will count the number of '0's in the substring `z`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(z.count('0'))` statement will print the number of '0's in the substring `z`.

Given the initial state and the operations, the output will depend on the specific values of `arr`, `n`, `x`, and `y`. However, without specific values, we can describe the output in general terms:

Output: **the number of '0's in the substring `z` (where `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`)**

This description covers all possible scenarios based on the given initial state.
