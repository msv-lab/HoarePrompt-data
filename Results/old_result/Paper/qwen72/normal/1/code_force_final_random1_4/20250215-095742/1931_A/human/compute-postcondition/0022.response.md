To determine what will be printed by the `print(word)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions that define the value of `word`.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1 (though this is not used in the `word` determination).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `word` is determined based on the value of `n` and the `alphabet` list, which we assume is the standard list of lowercase English letters: `['a', 'b', 'c', ..., 'z']`.

### Conditions for `word`:
1. If `n` > 52:
   - `word` is the character at index `n - 53` from the `alphabet` list followed by `'zz'`.
2. If `n` > 26 and `n` ≤ 52:
   - `word` is `'a'` followed by the character at index `n - 28` from the `alphabet` list and then `'z'`.
3. If `n` ≤ 26:
   - `word` is `'aa'` followed by the character at index `n - 3` from the `alphabet` list.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **If `n` > 52:**
   - The character at index `n - 53` from the `alphabet` list is used.
   - For example, if `n = 54`, then `n - 53 = 1`, so the character is `'b'`.
   - Therefore, `word` would be `'bzz'`.

2. **If `n` > 26 and `n` ≤ 52:**
   - The character at index `n - 28` from the `alphabet` list is used.
   - For example, if `n = 30`, then `n - 28 = 2`, so the character is `'c'`.
   - Therefore, `word` would be `'acz'`.

3. **If `n` ≤ 26:**
   - The character at index `n - 3` from the `alphabet` list is used.
   - For example, if `n = 5`, then `n - 3 = 2`, so the character is `'c'`.
   - Therefore, `word` would be `'aac'`.

### Final Output:
Since `n` is an input integer greater than 1, we need to consider the range of `n` to determine the exact value of `word`.

- If `n` > 52, `word` is the character at index `n - 53` from the `alphabet` list followed by `'zz'`.
- If `n` > 26 and `n` ≤ 52, `word` is `'a'` followed by the character at index `n - 28` from the `alphabet` list and then `'z'`.
- If `n` ≤ 26, `word` is `'aa'` followed by the character at index `n - 3` from the `alphabet` list.

Output: **word (where word is determined based on the value of n as described above)**

For a specific value of `n`, the output can be more precise. For example:
- If `n = 54`, Output: **bzz**
- If `n = 30`, Output: **acz**
- If `n = 5`, Output: **aac**
