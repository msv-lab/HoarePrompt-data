Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 or `k + 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0
        ans += ss


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 or `k + 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `ans` is an empty string or the string containing the first character of `s`, `cur` is either unchanged or set to 0, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` was initially `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `s`, and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `ans` remains an empty string, and `cur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 or `k + 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `ans` is an empty string or the string containing the first character of `s`. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 or 2, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `s` followed by the second character of `s`, `cur` is 0, and `tmp` is an empty string. Otherwise, `cur` is either unchanged or set to 0, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is unset, `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 or `k + 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1 or 2, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `s` followed by the third character of `s`, `cur` is 0, and `tmp` is an empty string or the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged, `tmp` is the character corresponding to the first unset bit in `cur` or an empty string if all bits are set, and `cnt` is 0 or 1, `ans` is an empty string or the string containing the first character of `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
