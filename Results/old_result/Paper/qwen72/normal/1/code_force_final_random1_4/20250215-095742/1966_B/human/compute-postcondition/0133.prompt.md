Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500), representing the dimensions of the grid, followed by n lines, each containing m characters 'W' or 'B', representing the colors of the grid cells. The total number of cells across all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    gr = []
    for i in range(n):
        gr.append(input())
    ans = 'YES'
    if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
        impossible = True
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                impossible = False
        if impossible:
            ans = 'NO'
        impossible = True
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                impossible = False
        if impossible:
            ans = 'NO'
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is the integer provided by the user input, `m` is the integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` user input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`. If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`, `ans` remains 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is the first integer provided by the user input, `m` is the second integer provided by the user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being a user input from each iteration of the loop), `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`. If the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer provided by the new user input and must be greater than 1, `m` is the second integer provided by the new user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a user input, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 2`, `ans` is 'YES'. If the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, and `impossible` is `True`, then for all `k` from 0 to `n - 2`, `gr[k][0] == gr[k + 1][0]` and `gr[k][m - 1] == gr[k + 1][m - 1]`, and `ans` is 'NO'. If `impossible` is `False`, then at least one of the conditions `gr[k][0] != gr[k + 1][0]` or `gr[k][m - 1] != gr[k + 1][m - 1]` is true for some `k` from 0 to `n - 2`, and `ans` is 'YES'. Otherwise, if the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, `ans` remains 'YES'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
