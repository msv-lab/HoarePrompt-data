Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, converted to integers. `ql` will be the last value of `ql - a[s - 1]` computed during the final iteration, `m` will be the last value of `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` computed during the final iteration, `l` will be equal to `q`, `i` will be 1, `s` will be the index where the final `ql` would be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order, the lists `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, and `v` remain unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`.**
