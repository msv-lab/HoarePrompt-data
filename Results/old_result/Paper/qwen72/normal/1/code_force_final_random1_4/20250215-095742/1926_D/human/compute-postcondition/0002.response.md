To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which are `num` and `a`.

1. **Variable `a`**: The loop will execute if `a` is a non-empty list. Since the initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, this means `a` is guaranteed to have at least one element. Therefore, `a` is already in a state that ensures the loop can execute.

2. **Variable `num`**: This variable will take the value of each element in `a` during each iteration of the loop. Before the loop starts, `num` should be set to the first element of `a` to ensure the loop can begin its first iteration.

Given these considerations, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `a` must be a list with at least one element (which is already satisfied by the given state).
- `num` should be the first element of `a`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `res` is 0, `count` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `a`**
