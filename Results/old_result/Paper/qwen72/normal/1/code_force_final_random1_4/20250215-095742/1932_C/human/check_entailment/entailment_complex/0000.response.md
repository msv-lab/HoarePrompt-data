Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the steps and verify if the implementation matches the requirements:

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up Initial Conditions:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.
   - These inputs are correctly read and passed to the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `b` is initialized as an empty list to store the elements of `a` in the order they are removed.
     - `l` and `r` are initialized to 0 and `n-1` respectively, representing the left and right pointers of the array `a`.

   - **Processing Commands:**
     - The program iterates over each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of `a` to `b` and increments `l`.
     - If the character is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of `a` to `b` and decrements `r`.
     - This step correctly processes the commands and updates the pointers accordingly.

   - **Computing the Cumulative Product Modulo `m`:**
     - The program initializes `p` to 1, which will store the cumulative product.
     - It iterates over the elements in `b` in reverse order, updating `p` with the product of the current element and the previous value of `p`, taking the result modulo `m`.
     - The result is appended to the list `ans`.

   - **Returning the Result:**
     - The function returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which correctly represents the cumulative product values at the beginning of each command execution.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
