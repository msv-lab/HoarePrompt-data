Postcondition: ***`smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 0, `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, and `suf` retain their initial values and conditions. If `sm` is less than 0, `sm` is now equal to `2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * (10`. Otherwise, `sm` is now equal to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10`.***
