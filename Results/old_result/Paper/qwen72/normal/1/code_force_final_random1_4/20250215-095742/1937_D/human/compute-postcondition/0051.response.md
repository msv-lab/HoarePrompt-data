Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `i` was initially `n - 2`, `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `s[i] == '<'`, `idx_B` contains `[n - 2]`. If `len(idx_B) == 0`, then `B` is `[0]` and `idx_B` is an empty list. Otherwise, `B` is a list containing `x`, `idx_B` is an empty list, and an error occurs because `B` and `idx_B` are empty lists, making `len(B) - 1` and `len(idx_B) - 1` invalid indices. `B` is now `[0, 0]`.** 

Explanation: The code `B.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the list `B`. Initially, `B` could be `[0]` or a list containing `x`. After appending `0`, `B` becomes `[0, 0]` if it was initially `[0]`, or `[x, 0]` if it was initially `[x]`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
