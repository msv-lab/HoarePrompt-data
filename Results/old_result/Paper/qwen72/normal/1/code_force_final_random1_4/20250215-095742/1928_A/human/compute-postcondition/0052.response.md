Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is reduced to 0, and all pairs of integers `a` and `b` provided by the user input have been processed. For each pair, if at least one of `a` or `b` is even, the program checks if `a1` (which is `a // 2` if `a` is even) is not equal to `b` or if `b1` (which is `b // 2` if `b` is even) is not equal to `a`. If either condition is met, the program prints 'Yes' and moves to the next iteration. If both `a` and `b` are odd, or if the conditions are not met, the program prints 'No' and moves to the next iteration. Once all iterations are complete, the loop terminates.**
