Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` (renamed to `A`, `B`, and `C` in the program).

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Condition 1**: `if B * 2 < C`: This checks if buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price. If true, the program prints `A * B`, which is the total cost of buying `A` yogurts at the individual price `B`.
   - **Condition 2**: `elif A % 2 == 0`: This checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even. If true, the program prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the total cost of buying `A` yogurts using the promotion price `C` for pairs of yogurts.
   - **Condition 3**: `else`: This handles the case where the number of yogurts `A` is odd. The program calculates the cost of buying `A // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price `C` and one additional yogurt at the individual price `B`, and prints `X * C + B`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the minimum cost for each test case based on the conditions described.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `A` is 1 (odd) and when `A` is 2 (even) correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where the promotion price `C` is less than twice the individual price `B`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
