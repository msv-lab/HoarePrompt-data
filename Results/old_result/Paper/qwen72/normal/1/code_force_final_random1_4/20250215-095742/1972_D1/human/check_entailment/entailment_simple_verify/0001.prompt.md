You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to check if it correctly solves the problem as described. Let's break down the requirements and the solution step by step:

### Problem Description:
- We are given two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \).
- We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \( 1 \le a \le n \)
  - \( 1 \le b \le m \)
  - \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

### Provided Solution:
The provided solution consists of several functions, but the main function that appears to be solving the problem is `func_15` and `func_16`.

#### Function `func_15`:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

- This function reads \( n \) and \( m \) from input.
- It initializes a counter `ans` to 0.
- It iterates over `i` starting from 1, and for each `i`, it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`.
- Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

#### Function `func_16`:
```python
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
```

- This function reads the number of test cases `t` from input.
- For each test case, it calls `func_15` and writes the result to standard output.

### Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_7()` reads the values of \( n \) and \( m \) for each test case.

2. **Logic in `func_15`**:
   - The loop condition `while i * i <= n + i` is not directly related to the problem statement.
   - The expression \((n + i) // (i * i)\) does not seem to correspond to the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

3. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_15` does not appear to correctly implement the required condition for counting valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The loop and the calculation inside the loop do not align with the problem's constraints and conditions.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in `func_15` is not aligned with the required conditions for counting valid pairs \((a, b)\).

Correctness: **False**
