Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers provided by the user input and each is greater than 0.
   - `X` is calculated as `A // 2`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement to be printed is `X * C + B`.

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2, which means `X = A // 2`.
   - The expression `X * C + B` involves multiplying `X` by `C` and then adding `B`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `X` is `A // 2`.
   - Therefore, the expression `X * C + B` becomes `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Given the initial state and the calculation, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A, B, and C are integers provided by the user input and each is greater than 0)**
