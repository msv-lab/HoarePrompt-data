Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10.
- The grid is represented by `n` lines of `n` characters, where each character is either '0' or '1'.
- The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1.
- `a` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `b` is the last input string.
- `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in each input string that contained at least one '1'. If no input strings contained '1's, `k` remains an empty list.
- The first two elements of `k` are equal (`k[0] == k[1]`).

Given these conditions, the code snippet is:
```python
print('SQUARE')
```

### Explanation:
- The code snippet simply prints the string `'SQUARE'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the grid and the variables, but none of this information affects the execution of the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **SQUARE**
