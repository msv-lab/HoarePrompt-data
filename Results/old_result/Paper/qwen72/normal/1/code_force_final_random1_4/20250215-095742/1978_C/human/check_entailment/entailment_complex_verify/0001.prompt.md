You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` remains a positive integer, `k` is reduced to a value that no longer satisfies the conditions for further loop execution (`k < i - 1` or `k == 0`), `l` is the result of applying `func_3` multiple times (specifically, `c` times, where `c` is the number of iterations the loop has run), and `c` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed. The value of `i` will be the last value decremented by 2 in the loop's range, which is either 0 or 1, depending on whether `n` is even or odd, respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the length of a permutation, and `k` is a non-negative integer representing a required Manhattan value. The function modifies the list `l`, which initially contains integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order. Depending on the value of `k`, the function may return the list `l` directly, or it may return the result of calling `func_2` or `func_3` with specific parameters. Specifically, the function can return `l` unchanged, the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`, or the result of `func_3(c, l)`, where `c` is the number of iterations the loop has executed. The final state of the program is such that `l` is either the original list or a modified version of it, and `k` is reduced to a value that no longer satisfies the conditions for further loop execution.

The new value at index `-c` is the original value at index `-c - k`, and the new value at index `-c - k` is the original value at index `-c`. All other elements in the list remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `c`, `k`, and `l`. It swaps the elements at indices `-c` and `-c - k` in the list `l` and returns the modified list. The new value at index `-c` is the original value at index `-c - k`, and the new value at index `-c - k` is the original value at index `-c`. All other elements in the list remain unchanged.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a positive integer, l is a list of integers with at least c elements.
def func_3(c, l):
    x, y = l[-c], l[c - 1]

    #The program returns the list `l`, which is a list of integers with at least `c` elements. The element at index `c - 1` in `l` is `x`, and the element at index `-c` in `l` is `y`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a positive integer `c` and a list of integers `l` with at least `c` elements. It swaps the elements at indices `c - 1` and `-c` in the list `l`. The function returns the modified list `l`, where the elements at these indices have been swapped.

    #State: `n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= `k` <= 10^12, and `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the user. Additionally, `k` is even.

    return n, k
    #The program returns the values of `n` and `k`, where `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `k` is an even non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^12. Additionally, `max_k` is set to `n` regardless of whether `n` is odd or even, and `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads two non-negative integers `n` and `k` from user input, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `0 <= k <= 10^12`. If `k` is odd, the function returns `(0, 0)`. If `k` is even, the function calculates `max_k` based on the parity of `n`: if `n` is odd, `max_k` is set to `(n^2 - 1) // 2`; if `n` is even, `max_k` is set to `n^2 // 2`. If `k` exceeds `max_k`, the function returns `(0, 0)`. Otherwise, the function returns the values of `n` and `k`.

    print()
    #This is printed: (a blank line)
    return
    #The program returns nothing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of integers representing a valid permutation of length `n`. It prints "YES" followed by each integer in the list `l` in the order they appear, separated by spaces. After printing all the integers, it prints a blank line. The function does not return any value.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12.
def func_6():
    n, k = func_4()
    if (n == 0) :

        #This is printed: NO

        #The program returns None.
    #State: *`n` and `k` are integers assigned by `func_4()`, and 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12, and `n` is not equal to 0
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_5(l)
    return
    #The program does not return any value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves two integers `n` and `k` from the function `func_4`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns `None`. Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `k`, passing the result to `func_5`. In both cases, the function either returns `None` or does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation `p` of length `n` such that the Manhattan value of `p` equals `k`.
   - The Manhattan value is defined as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).
   - If no such permutation exists, we should output "No".

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **func_4:** This function reads the input values `n` and `k`, checks if `k` is even, and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. It returns `(n, k)` if valid, otherwise `(0, 0)`.
   - **func_1:** This function attempts to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value. It uses a list `l` initialized to `[1, 2, ..., n]` and modifies it to achieve the required Manhattan value.
   - **func_2 and func_3:** These functions are helper functions used by `func_1` to swap elements in the list `l` to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - **func_5:** This function prints the permutation if a valid one is found.
   - **func_6:** This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4` to get valid `n` and `k`, then calls `func_1` to generate the permutation, and finally calls `func_5` to print the result.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - **func_4:** The logic for checking if `k` is even and calculating the maximum possible Manhattan value is correct. The maximum Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is indeed \(\frac{n^2}{2}\) for even `n` and \(\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}\) for odd `n`.
   - **func_1:** The function attempts to construct the permutation by swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value. However, the logic for adjusting the Manhattan value by swapping elements is not straightforward and may not always produce the correct result.
   - **func_2 and func_3:** These functions perform specific swaps to adjust the Manhattan value. The logic here seems to be correct but needs to be carefully verified.
   - **func_5 and func_6:** These functions handle the output and orchestration, which appear to be correct.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The logic in `func_1` for constructing the permutation might not always produce the correct result, especially for larger values of `n` and `k`.
   - The condition `if k < i - 1:` in `func_1` might not correctly handle all edge cases.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity of the problem and the potential issues in the construction logic of `func_1`, the provided program may not always produce the correct permutation for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
