To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `m` is greater than 1.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input.
   - `i` is defined as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
   - `s` is defined as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, the condition holds true.
   - Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1, or `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains the statement `print('NO')`.

Given the conditions, the `print('NO')` statement will execute if the condition does not hold true. Let's break down the condition:

- **Condition Analysis:**
  - `b - a + 1` represents the number of elements between indices `a` and `b` inclusive.
  - `s - (b - a + 1)` represents the difference between `s` and the number of elements between `a` and `b`.
  - `i` is the difference between `c[b]` and `c[a - 1]`.

The condition checks:
- If the number of elements between `a` and `b` is greater than 1.
- If the difference `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`.

If either of these conditions is not met, the `print('NO')` statement will execute.

Since the condition is not explicitly stated to be true, and the problem states that the `print('NO')` statement is executed, we can conclude that the condition does not hold true.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
