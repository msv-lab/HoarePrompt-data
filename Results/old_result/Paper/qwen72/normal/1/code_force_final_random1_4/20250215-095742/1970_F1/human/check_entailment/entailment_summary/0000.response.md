### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the dimensions of the grid (`n` and `m`) and initializes the grid based on the input.
   - It also initializes dictionaries and lists to keep track of the positions of players, the Quaffle, and the goals.
   - The function correctly parses the commands for each turn and updates the positions accordingly.

2. **Movement and Position Updates:**
   - The movement dictionary `mov` is correctly defined to handle the four possible directions (U, D, L, R).
   - The function updates the positions of players and the Quaffle based on the commands.
   - It correctly handles the case where a player catches the Quaffle and updates the player's state to indicate they are carrying the Quaffle.

3. **Scoring and Game Events:**
   - The function correctly checks if a player has thrown the Quaffle into a goal using the `goalIn` function.
   - It prints the appropriate event message when a goal is scored and updates the score accordingly.
   - The function also handles the case where a player scores in their own goal, awarding the point to the opposing team.

4. **Final Score and Output:**
   - After processing all the commands, the function prints the final score in the required format.
   - The function does not return any value but prints the final state of the game, including the scores and any relevant game events.

5. **Helper Functions:**
   - The `goalIn` function correctly identifies whether a position is a goal for the red team, the blue team, or neither.
   - The `isPlayer` function correctly identifies whether a given string represents a player.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the rules and logic described in the problem statement. It processes the input, simulates the game, and outputs the correct events and final score.

**Correctness: True**
