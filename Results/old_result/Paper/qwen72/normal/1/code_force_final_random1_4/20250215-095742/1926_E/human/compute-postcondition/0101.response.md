To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is `t - 1` (This variable is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it.)
- `t` remains unchanged (We don't need the value of `t` for this calculation.)
- `n` is 0
- `k` is the second input integer
- `m` is the last computed value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0 or non-positive
- `L` is a list containing at least three values of `(n + 1) // 2` computed during the loop
- `pow` is 4
- `a` is the third element in `L`
- `tot` is updated to `tot + a`

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **List `L` and Element `a`:**
   - `L` contains at least three values of `(n + 1) // 2` computed during the loop.
   - Let's assume `L` is `[1, 1, 1, ...]` (since `n` starts at 0 and decreases, the values of `(n + 1) // 2` will be 1, 0, 0, ...).
   - The third element in `L` is `1` (assuming the list starts with 1).

2. **Variable `a`:**
   - `a` is the third element in `L`, so `a = 1`.

3. **Variable `tot`:**
   - `tot` is updated to `tot + a`.
   - If `tot` was initially 0, then after the update, `tot = 0 + 1 = 1`.

4. **Variable `k`:**
   - `k` is the second input integer. We don't have the exact value of `k`, but it is an integer.

5. **Expression inside the `print` statement:**
   - The expression is `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - Substituting the known values:
     - `pow = 4`
     - `tot = 1`
     - The expression becomes: `4 * (2 * (k - 1) - 1)`.

6. **Simplifying the expression:**
   - `2 * (k - 1) - 1` simplifies to `2k - 2 - 1` which is `2k - 3`.
   - Therefore, the expression becomes: `4 * (2k - 3)`.

7. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the result of `4 * (2k - 3)`.

### Final Output:
Output: **4 * (2k - 3) (where k is the second input integer)**
