To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`command`**: This is a list of strings obtained from the input line.
2. **`t`**: This is a positive integer (`t > 0`).
3. **`obj`**: This is the first element of the `command` list.
4. **`com`**: This is the second element of the `command` list.
5. **`pos`**: This is the value of `elements[obj]`, which is the position of the object `obj`.
6. **`nxt`**: This is the new position calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
7. **`allPlayers[obj]`**: This is `False`.
8. **`team`**: This is the result of the function `goalIn(pos)`, which determines the team that scored a goal based on the current position `pos`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
```

Let's analyze the components of this statement:

- **`time`**: This is the value of `t`, which is a positive integer.
- **`GoalName[team]`**: This is the name of the team that scored a goal, retrieved from the `GoalName` dictionary using the `team` key.

Given the initial state, we can infer the following:

- `time` is the value of `t`, which is greater than 0.
- `team` is the result of the function `goalIn(pos)`, which returns the team that scored a goal based on the position `pos`.

Since the exact values of `t`, `pos`, and the `GoalName` dictionary are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **%d %s GOAL (where %d is the value of `t` and %s is the name of the team that scored a goal, retrieved from the `GoalName` dictionary using the `team` key)**
