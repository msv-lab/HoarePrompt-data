Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `t` and a list `test_cases` as inputs. `t` represents the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, where each element is a list containing two sublists: the first sublist has a single integer `n` (the number of signs), and the second sublist has `n` integers (the periodicities of the signs). The function processes each test case to determine the smallest year such that all signs in the test case will appear simultaneously. It returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element is the smallest year for the corresponding test case. The input parameters `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged after the function execution. **
