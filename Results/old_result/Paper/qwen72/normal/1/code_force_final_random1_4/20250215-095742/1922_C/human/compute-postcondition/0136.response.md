Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the input integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d1[2]` is 1, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2[n-1]` is 1, and `d2[n-2]` is 1 + `d2[n-1]`. Additionally, the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is less than the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]` updates the value of `d2[i]`.
- Given that `i` is `n-2`, the code sets `d2[n-2]` to `1 + d2[n-1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
