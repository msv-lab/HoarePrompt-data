Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2` and must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `L` is a list containing the value of `m`, `tot` remains unchanged, `pow` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged from the initial state.
