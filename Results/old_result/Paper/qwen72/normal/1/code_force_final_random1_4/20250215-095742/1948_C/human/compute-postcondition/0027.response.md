Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, the loop counter `_` is 0. If the condition `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<') or (a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` is true, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement after the if block.***
