Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem as specified. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes the commands and calculates the required remainders.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements of `a` in the order they are removed.
   - It uses two pointers `l` and `r` to track the left and right ends of the array `a`.

3. **Processing Commands**:
   - For each command in `s`, it appends the appropriate element from `a` to `b` and updates the pointers `l` or `r` accordingly.
   - This ensures that elements are removed from the correct end of the array as per the command.

4. **Calculating Remainders**:
   - After processing all commands, the function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the remainders.
   - It iterates over the elements in `b` in reverse order, calculating the cumulative product modulo `m` and appending the result to `ans`.

5. **Returning Results**:
   - The function returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which matches the order of commands in `s`.

### Verification of Correctness:
- **Order of Elements**: The elements are correctly appended to `b` in the order they are removed from `a` based on the commands in `s`.
- **Cumulative Product Modulo `m`**: The cumulative product is calculated correctly using the modulo operation to ensure the result stays within the bounds of `m`.
- **Reversal of Results**: The results are returned in the correct order, matching the order of commands in `s`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
