The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and assigns the first part to `n` and the second part to `k`, both converted to integers.

- `n` and `k` are now assigned specific integer values based on the user's input.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is a list of integers input by the user.**
