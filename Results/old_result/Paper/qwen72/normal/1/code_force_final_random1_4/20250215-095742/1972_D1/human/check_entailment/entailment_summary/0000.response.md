### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_10()**: Reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - **func_15()**: For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7()`, and then calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) using a specific algorithm.
   - **func_16()**: Iterates over the number of test cases and prints the result of `func_15()` for each test case.

3. **func_15() Analysis**:
   - The function reads \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7()`.
   - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It enters a loop where it increments `i` and adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans` until \(i^2 > n + i\).
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

4. **Algorithm Validity**:
   - The algorithm in `func_15()` does not directly address the problem of finding pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The loop and the condition \(i^2 > n + i\) do not seem to be related to the problem's requirements.
   - The function `func_15()` appears to be solving a different problem, possibly a mathematical sum, but not the one described in the problem statement.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem.
   - Therefore, the overall program is incorrect because it does not produce the correct output for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**False**
