The value of `i` is incremented by the value of `x`. Given that `x` is the second element in the list `l`, and `i` is 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise `i` is 0, the new value of `i` will depend on the value of `x`.

- If `x` is 1, then `i` was initially 1, and after incrementing by `x` (which is also 1), `i` becomes 2.
- If `x` is not 1, then `i` was initially 0, and after incrementing by `x` (which is not 1), `i` remains 0.

The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `j`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing elements [0, `i`], `c` is a list containing elements [0, `j`], `i` is 2 if `x` is 1, otherwise `i` is 0, `j` is 2 if `x` is 1, otherwise `j` is 1, and `x` is the second element in the list `l`.**
