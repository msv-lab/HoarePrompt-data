Output State: **The program returns a list named `results` containing t elements, where each element represents the final value of `current_year` after processing the corresponding test case from the `test_cases` list. Each test case consists of a single integer n followed by a list of n integers. The length of `results` is equal to the value of `t`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.**
