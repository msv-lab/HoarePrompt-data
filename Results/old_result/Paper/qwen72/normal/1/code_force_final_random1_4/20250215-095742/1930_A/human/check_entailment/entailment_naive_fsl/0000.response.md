Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it works for every potential case:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, the program sorts the list of integers `l`. Sorting ensures that the smallest elements are considered first, which is crucial for maximizing the score.
3. **Score Calculation**: The program iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the smaller of each pair to the score. Since the list is sorted, the element at index `i` (where `i` is even) is always the smaller of the pair `(l[i], l[i+1])`.
4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated score for each test case.

### Why It Works:
- **Optimal Pairing**: By sorting the list, the program ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, which maximizes the sum of the minimum values of each pair.
- **Correct Iteration**: The loop `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2)` correctly iterates over the pairs of elements, ensuring that all elements are used exactly once.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `n` is 1 or when all elements are the same. In these cases, the sorted list and the pairing logic still produce the correct result.

Since the program correctly handles all potential cases and follows the problem description, it is considered correct.
