Output State: **`n` must be at least `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, `dp[5]` is 81, and so on up to `dp[n]` which is the value computed by the loop.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 3` to `i = n`. After all iterations, `i` will be `n + 1`.
- The variable `k` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- The array `dp` is updated in each iteration according to the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`.
- After the loop completes, `dp` will contain the computed values for each index from 1 to `n`.

For example, if `n = 5`, the final state would be:
- `n` is 5
- `i` is 6
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 5
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3
- `dp[3]` is 7
- `dp[4]` is 25
- `dp[5]` is 81

If `n` were larger, the `dp` array would continue to be filled with the corresponding values up to `dp[n]`.
