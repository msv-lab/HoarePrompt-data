You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; c is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; queries is a list of q pairs (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [0]
        
        c = [0]
        
        i, j = 0, 0
        
        for x in l:
            if x == 1:
                j += 1
            i += x
            p.append(i)
            c.append(j)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
            s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is decremented by the number of test cases processed, `n` and `q` remain as initially defined, `l` is the list of integers from user input, `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`, `c` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of `1`s in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`, `i` and `j` are the final counts of the cumulative sums and `1`s respectively, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers from user input, `s` is the difference `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, and `m` is 0. For each query, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `queries`. It processes `t` test cases, each with a list `c` of `n` integers and `q` queries. For each query `(l_i, r_i)`, the function returns the result of the query on the sublist `c[l_i-1:r_i]`. The function returns a list of results for all queries across all test cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
