Postcondition: ***`smin` is a list containing `n + 4` elements with the first element being 0. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, the last element of `smin` is `suf[3]`, and the second-to-last element is also `suf[3]`. Otherwise, the last element of `smin` is `smin[2]`, and the second-to-last element is 0. `i` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be greater than 1, `t` retains its initial value and conditions, `j` is `j + 1`, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `suf` is now `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l[:n])]`, and `sm` is updated based on the condition: if `sm` is less than 0, `sm` is now equal to `2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * (10`; otherwise, `sm` is now equal to `(2 + suf[n]) % (10`.***
