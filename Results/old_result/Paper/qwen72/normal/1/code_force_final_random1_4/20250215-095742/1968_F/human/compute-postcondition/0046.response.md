Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]` and is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` and is greater than 0, `idx` is increased by `n + 3`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is set to the integer value of `data[idx - (n - i + 1)]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, and the rest are zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from index 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index, and the rest are zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with keys being the unique values in `pf` and values being lists of indices where those values occur, `i` is `n`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices where `pf[r]` occurs in `pf`, `v2` is the list of indices where `pf[l - 1]` occurs in `pf` or an empty list `[]` if `pf[l - 1]` is not found in `mp`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where the first element greater than or equal to `l` is located.**

Explanation:
- The code `it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)` uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the index in `v1` where the first element greater than or equal to `l` is located.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
