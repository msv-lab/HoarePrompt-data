The function `func_3` takes two parameters: `arr`, a list of elements that can be converted to strings, and `sym`, a string. It returns a single string where each element of `arr` is converted to a string and concatenated together, with `sym` inserted between each element. The original list `arr` and the string `sym` remain unchanged.
