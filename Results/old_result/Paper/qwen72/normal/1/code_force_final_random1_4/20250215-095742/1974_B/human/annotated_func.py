#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of s is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    i, j = 0, len(unique_chars) - 1
    for char in s:
        if char in unique_chars:
            s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
            j -= 1
        else:
            unique_chars.insert(i, char)
            i += 1
            j += 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `s` will consist of the last unique character in the original `unique_chars` list repeated for the length of the original string `s`. The `unique_chars` list will contain all characters from the original `s`, including duplicates, in the order they were encountered, and `i` will be equal to the number of unique characters in the original `s` that were not initially in `unique_chars`. `j` will be 0.
    return ''.join(unique_chars)
    #The program returns a string composed of all characters from the original `s`, including duplicates, in the order they were encountered.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string. This new string contains all characters from the original `s`, including duplicates, in the order they were encountered. The function modifies the input string `s` during its execution, but the final returned string is a concatenation of all characters from the original `s`, preserving their order.
