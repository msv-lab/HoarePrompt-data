Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.**

Explanation: The code `x = s.count('map')` updates the value of `x` to be the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s`. The other variables (`_`, `t`, `a`, `s`, and `y`) remain unchanged.
