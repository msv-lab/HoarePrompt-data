Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 3`, `zero` is `zero`, `one` is `one`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - 3)`, and `lst` now includes the value `3` at the end.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i + 1` (which is `3` since `i` is `2`) to the list `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.
