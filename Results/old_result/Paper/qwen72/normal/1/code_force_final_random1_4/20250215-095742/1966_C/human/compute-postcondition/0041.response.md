To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the condition provided:

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, the following conditions hold:
- The `dp` variable is either `True` or `False`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement uses a conditional expression (`'Alice' if dp else 'Bob'`).
- This expression evaluates to `'Alice'` if `dp` is `True`.
- It evaluates to `'Bob'` if `dp` is `False`.

### Conclusion:
- Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `dp`, we can only describe the output based on the two possible states of `dp`.

Output: **'Alice' if dp is True, otherwise 'Bob'**
