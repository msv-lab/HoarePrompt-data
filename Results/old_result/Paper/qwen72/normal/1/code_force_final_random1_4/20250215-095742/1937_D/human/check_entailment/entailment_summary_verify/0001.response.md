### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a one-dimensional grid with characters `<` and `>`. A pinball placed on a cell moves left or right based on the character and the character flips after the move.
   - The goal is to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Algorithm Overview**:
   - The program uses two arrays, `A` and `B`, to precompute the cumulative movements for `<` and `>` directions.
   - `A` tracks the cumulative effect of `>` characters from left to right.
   - `B` tracks the cumulative effect of `<` characters from right to left.
   - These arrays help in efficiently calculating the time for each pinball to leave the grid.

3. **Detailed Steps**:
   - **Precomputation**:
     - For `A`: Iterate from left to right, and for each `>`, compute the cumulative effect of previous `>` characters.
     - For `B`: Iterate from right to left, and for each `<`, compute the cumulative effect of previous `<` characters.
   - **Query Processing**:
     - For each cell, depending on whether it is `>` or `<`, use the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the time to leave the grid.
     - The calculations involve adjusting the cumulative effects based on the current position and the direction of movement.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` processes the string `s` to calculate and print the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
   - The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.
   - The lists `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` are used to store intermediate values for efficient computation.

5. **Code Analysis**:
   - The precomputation steps for `A` and `B` are correctly implemented.
   - The query processing step involves complex calculations to adjust the cumulative effects based on the current position and direction.
   - The logic for handling edge cases and boundary conditions appears to be correct.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the pinball starts at the boundary of the grid.
   - It also handles cases where there are no `<` or `>` characters in certain segments of the grid.

7. **Complexity**:
   - The precomputation steps run in O(n) time.
   - Each query is processed in O(1) time using the precomputed values.
   - Overall, the program is efficient and should handle the constraints provided in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The precomputation and query processing steps are well-structured and should handle all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
