To determine what will be printed by the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `m` is greater than 0.
   - `d1` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0, and `d1[2]` is 1.
   - `j` is `m-1`.
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user.
   - `d2` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0, and `d2[n-1]` is 1.
   - `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Relevant Variables:**
   - `d2` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0.
   - `d2[n-1]` is explicitly set to 1.
   - `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` will print the difference between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`.

4. **Analysis:**
   - Since `d2` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0, any key that is not explicitly set will return 0.
   - `d2[n-1]` is explicitly set to 1.
   - If `y` or `x` is equal to `n-1`, then `d2[y]` or `d2[x]` will be 1.
   - If `y` or `x` is not equal to `n-1`, then `d2[y]` or `d2[x]` will be 0.

5. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `y == n-1` and `x != n-1`, then `d2[y] = 1` and `d2[x] = 0`, so `d2[y] - d2[x] = 1 - 0 = 1`.
   - If `y != n-1` and `x == n-1`, then `d2[y] = 0` and `d2[x] = 1`, so `d2[y] - d2[x] = 0 - 1 = -1`.
   - If both `y` and `x` are not equal to `n-1`, then `d2[y] = 0` and `d2[x] = 0`, so `d2[y] - d2[x] = 0 - 0 = 0`.
   - If both `y` and `x` are equal to `n-1`, then `d2[y] = 1` and `d2[x] = 1`, so `d2[y] - d2[x] = 1 - 1 = 0`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that `y` is less than or equal to `x`, the only scenario where `y` could be `n-1` and `x` could be different is if `y == n-1` and `x > y`, but since `y <= x`, this scenario is not possible.
   - Therefore, the only possible scenarios are:
     - `y` and `x` are both not equal to `n-1`, resulting in `0 - 0 = 0`.
     - `y` and `x` are both equal to `n-1`, resulting in `1 - 1 = 0`.

Thus, the output will always be 0.

Output: **0**
