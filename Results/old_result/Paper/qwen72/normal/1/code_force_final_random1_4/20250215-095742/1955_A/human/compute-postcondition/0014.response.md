Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers provided by the user input and each is greater than 0.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(A * B)
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement will output the product of `A` and `B`.
- Since `A` and `B` are integers provided by the user and both are greater than 0, the result of `A * B` will be a positive integer.

### Output:
Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers provided by the user and each is greater than 0)**
