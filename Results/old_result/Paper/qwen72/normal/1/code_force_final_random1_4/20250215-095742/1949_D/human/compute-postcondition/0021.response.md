Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, `x` is a user input string, and `j` is 2. If the character at index `j - 1` (which is 1) of `x` is 'S', then `b[2]` is set to 2. Otherwise, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
