Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is greater than 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer provided by the new user input, `m` is the second integer provided by the new user input, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a user input, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, if the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` is still greater than 2.
- The variable `tc` remains 2.
- The variable `n` is the first integer provided by the user, and it determines the number of iterations the loop runs.
- The variable `m` is the second integer provided by the user.
- The list `gr` now contains `n` elements, where each element is a string input by the user during each iteration of the loop.
- The variable `i` is now `n-1`, which is the final value of the loop counter after the loop has completed.
- The variable `j` remains `m-2`.
- The variable `ans` is 'NO' if the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.
