Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is a new input positive integer (at least 1), `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `a[0]` set to 1000, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is set to `1000 + sum(x[:i])`, `i` is `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `_` is 2, `n` is a new input positive integer (at least 1), `x` is a list of integers derived from user input, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `a[0]` set to 1000, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is set to `1000 + sum(x[:i])`, and `i` is `n-1`.
- The code snippet `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `x` to a new list of integers derived from user input.
- Since the rest of the variables (`_`, `n`, `a`, and `i`) are not modified by the code snippet, their values remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `x` while keeping the other variables the same as in the initial state.
