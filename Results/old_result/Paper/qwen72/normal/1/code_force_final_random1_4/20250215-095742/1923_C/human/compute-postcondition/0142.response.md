Based on the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `l` is a list of integers from user input.
   - `i` is the difference between the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `b` and the cumulative count of `1`s up to index `a-1` in `l`.
   - `p` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`.
   - `j` is the count of `1`s in `l`.
   - `c` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of `1`s in `l` up to that point, starting with `[0]`.
   - `n` and `m` must be greater than 1.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `a` and `b` are integers from user input.
   - `s` is now equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables and objects described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
