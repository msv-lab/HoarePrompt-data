Reasoning:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The function `func_1` initializes the dynamic programming array `dp` with base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. This is correct because for a 1x1 board, there is only one way to place a rook, and for a 2x2 board, there are three ways to place rooks without them attacking each other (one in each cell).

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**: The transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is used to compute the number of ways to place rooks on an i x i board. This formula is derived from the fact that:
   - Placing a rook in the first row or column leaves an (i-1) x (i-1) subproblem.
   - Placing a rook in the first row and a rook in the first column (but not in the same cell) leaves an (i-2) x (i-2) subproblem, and there are 2 * (i-1) ways to do this (choosing one of the (i-1) cells in the first row and one of the (i-1) cells in the first column).

3. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.

4. **Invalid Positions**: The set `invalid` is used to keep track of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks. This is done by adding the row and column indices of each move to the set.

5. **Final Configuration Calculation**: The program calculates the number of possible final configurations by subtracting the number of invalid rows and columns from `n` and looking up the result in the `dp` array. The `max(1, ...)` ensures that the result is at least 1, which is necessary because even if all rows and columns are invalid, there is still one configuration (no rooks placed).

6. **Modulo Operation**: The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
