Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers provided by the user, `x` is greater than 1, `lst[a]` now includes `b` as an additional element (appended), `rev[b]` now includes `a` as an additional element (appended twice), and the other variables (`n`, `u_1`, `y`, `rev`) remain unchanged.** 

Explanation: The code `rev[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `rev[b]`. Since the initial state already mentioned that `rev[b]` includes `a` as an additional element, appending `a` again means `rev[b]` now includes `a` twice. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
