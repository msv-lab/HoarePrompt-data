Output State: **`i` is `n - 1 - j`, `A` and `idx_A` will contain elements based on the positions of '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The value of `i` is updated to `n - 1 - j`. Since `j` is 0, `i` becomes `n - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
