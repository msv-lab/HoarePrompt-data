Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of cities with unique positions and a series of queries. For each test case, it calculates and stores the minimum distance to the next city from both directions (left and right). It then answers each query by providing the difference in these stored distances between two specified cities. The function reads inputs from standard input and prints the results of the queries to standard output. **
