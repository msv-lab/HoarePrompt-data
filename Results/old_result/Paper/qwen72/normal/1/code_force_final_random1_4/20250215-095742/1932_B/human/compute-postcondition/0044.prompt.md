Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements where t must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year`, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test`, `current_year` is 0, `ai` is the last element of the list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for ai in a:
    if current_year % ai == 0:
        next_year = current_year + ai
    else:
        next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
    current_year = next_year


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements where t must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year`, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and must have at least one element, `current_year` is `ai`, `ai` is the first element of the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements where t must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year`, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and must have at least two elements, `current_year` is updated to `next_year`, `ai` is the second element of the list `a`. If `current_year % ai == 0`, then `next_year` was `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` was `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t elements where t must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year`, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and must have at least three elements, `ai` is the third element of the list `a`, `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
