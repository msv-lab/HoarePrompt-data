Postcondition: ***`smin` is a list containing `2 * n + 1` elements with the first element being 0. Each subsequent element in `smin` is the minimum value encountered in the `suf` list up to that index. `i` is 2. `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b` and must be at least 1. `t` retains its initial value and conditions. `j` is `j + 1`. `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input. `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`. `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input. `suf` is now `[0, l[0], l[0] + l[1], ..., sum(l[:n])]`. If `suf[2] - smin[2]` is greater than `sm` or `sm` is equal to `-111`, then `sm` is set to `suf[2] - smin[2]`. Otherwise, `sm` retains its initial value of `2 + suf[n] + (a + 1) * 10`.***
