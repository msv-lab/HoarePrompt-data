The only object in the loop head is the variable `prob`, which is derived from the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in the list `a` to assign to `prob`.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases` and must contain at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must contain at least two elements.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `prob` will be the second element of `a`.
- The state of `a` remains that it must contain at least two elements.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases` and must contain at least two elements, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where one of the elements at index 0 to 6 is incremented by 1, `prob` is the second element of `a`**
