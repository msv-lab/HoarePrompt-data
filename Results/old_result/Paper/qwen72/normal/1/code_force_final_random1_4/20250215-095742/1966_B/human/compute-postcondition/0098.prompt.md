Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer provided by the new user input, `m` is the second integer provided by the new user input, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-2`, if the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    gr.append(input())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 2, `tc` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer provided by the new user input, `gr` is a list containing one element which is the user input, `i` will be set by the loop (starting from 0), `j` is `m-2`, if the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` is greater than `i_prev + 1`, `gr` is a list with one additional element appended, which is the user input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `n` must be greater than `i_prev + 2`, `gr` is a list with two additional elements appended, which are the user inputs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
