The code snippet updates the value of `mex` by subtracting the value of `ar[i]` from it. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `_` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers from the user input that must have at least 1 element
- `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None` except for the last element which is now `mex - ar[i]` and the element at index `i` which is also `mex - ar[i]`
- `mex` is `n - ar[i]` if `ar[i]` is greater than 0, otherwise `mex` remains `n`
- `i` is `len(ar) - 2`

The new value of `mex` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`. Since `mex` was initially `n - ar[i]` (if `ar[i]` > 0) or `n` (if `ar[i]` <= 0), the updated value of `mex` will be:

- If `ar[i]` > 0: `mex` becomes `(n - ar[i]) - ar[i]` which simplifies to `n - 2 * ar[i]`
- If `ar[i]` <= 0: `mex` becomes `n - ar[i]`

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers from the user input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None` except for the last element which is now `mex - ar[i]` and the element at index `i` which is also `mex - ar[i]`, `mex` is `n - 2 * ar[i]` if `ar[i]` is greater than 0, otherwise `mex` is `n - ar[i]`, and `i` is `len(ar) - 2`.**
