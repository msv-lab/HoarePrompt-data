To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while i * i <= n + i:
```

### Current State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), updated by `func_7()`.
- `i` is 3.
- `ans` is \((n + 1) + ((n + 2) // 4)\).

### Loop Condition Analysis:
The loop condition is `i * i <= n + i`. Let's substitute the current values into this condition:

- `i` is 3.
- Therefore, the condition becomes \(3 * 3 \leq n + 3\).
- Simplifying, we get \(9 \leq n + 3\).
- Solving for \(n\), we get \(n \geq 6\).

### Adjustments Needed:
For the loop to execute one more time, the condition \(i * i \leq n + i\) must still hold true after the next iteration. Since `i` is 3, the condition \(9 \leq n + 3\) must be satisfied. This means \(n\) must be at least 6.

### Conclusion:
The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `n`. The current state of `n` must be such that \(n \geq 6\) for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), updated by `func_7()`, `i` is 3, `ans` is \((n + 1) + ((n + 2) // 4)\), and `n` must be at least 6**.
