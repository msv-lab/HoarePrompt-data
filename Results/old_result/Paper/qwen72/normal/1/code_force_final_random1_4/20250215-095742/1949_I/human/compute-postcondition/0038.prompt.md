Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef[i] = 1
        tot = 0
        bipartite = True
        dfs(i)
        ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `False` values except possibly `visited[0]` which may be `True`, `coef` is a list with the first element set to 1 and the rest might be updated, `tot` might be updated, `bipartite` might be `False`, `ok` is `True` if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers (potentially updated). If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited[0]` and `visited[1]` are `True`, `coef[1]` is set to 1, `tot` is potentially incremented or modified, `bipartite` is potentially set to `False`, and `ok` is `True` if `tot` is not 0 or if `bipartite` is `True`. If `visited[i]` is `True`, the state remains unchanged from the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers (potentially updated), `visited[2]` is `True` if it was `False` initially, `coef[1]` is set to 1 if `visited[2]` was `False` in the previous iteration, `coef[2]` is set to 1 if `visited[2]` was `False` initially, `tot` might be updated (could be 0 or a non-zero value), `bipartite` might be updated (could be `True` or `False`), and `ok` is `True` if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0, or if `ok` was already `True` before the update.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
