The provided code snippet reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. This operation does not affect the initial state of `t` or `i`, but it updates the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` based on the user's input. Since the input values for `A`, `B`, and `C` are provided by the user and must be greater than 0, the specific values of these variables are determined by the user's input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers provided by the user input and each is greater than 0.**
