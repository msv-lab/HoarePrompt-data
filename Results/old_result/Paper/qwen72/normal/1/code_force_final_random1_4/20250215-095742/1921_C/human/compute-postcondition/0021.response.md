To determine what will be printed by the `print('Yes')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to the initial value of `n`.
   - `test_cases` is an integer where 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4.
   - `feat` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `f` is equal to the second element of `feat`.
   - `a` is equal to the third element of `feat`.
   - `b` is equal to the last element of `feat`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `array2` is a list that contains elements based on the condition `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1`. Each element in `array2` is the result of `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a` if the condition is met.
   - The sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`.

2. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a` determines whether an element should be added to `array2`.
   - If the condition is met, the element added to `array2` is `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a`.
   - The sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` must be less than `f`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print('Yes')` statement will execute if the conditions described above are satisfied.

Given the conditions, the `print('Yes')` statement will always print "Yes" because the conditions provided ensure that the sum of the elements in `array2` and the additional product meet the requirement to be less than `f`.

Therefore, the output of the `print('Yes')` statement is:

Output: **Yes**
