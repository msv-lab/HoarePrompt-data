Postcondition: ***After the increment, `j` will be 3. If `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, `nx` is updated to include one additional 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is incremented by the character 'F'. The variables `n`, `i`, `xx`, and `sb` remain unchanged, and the condition for the loop to execute again is that `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.***
