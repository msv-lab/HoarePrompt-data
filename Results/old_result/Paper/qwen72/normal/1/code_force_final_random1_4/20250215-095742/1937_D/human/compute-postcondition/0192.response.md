Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is 0, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, `a` is assigned the value of `A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is assigned the value of `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 2) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 2) * l`. If `r - l >= 0`, `b` is further modified to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 2) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 2) * l`.***
