Precondition: **a and b are integers.** 

However, based on the problem description provided, the function `func_1(a, b)` seems to be a placeholder and does not match the complexity of the described Quidditch game simulation. The function signature should reflect the inputs required for simulating the game, such as the dimensions of the field, the initial state of the field, and the sequence of actions. A more appropriate function definition might look like this:

```python
def simulate_quidditch_game(N, M, field, T, actions):
```

For this function, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **N and M are integers such that 3 <= N, M <= 99 and N, M are odd; field is a list of N strings, each string is composed of M pairs of characters representing the initial state of the field; T is an integer such that 0 <= T <= 10000; actions is a list of T strings, each describing a valid action in the game.**
