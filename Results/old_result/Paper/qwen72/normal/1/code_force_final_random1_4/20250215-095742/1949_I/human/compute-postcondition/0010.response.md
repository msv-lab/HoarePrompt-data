The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i` (so `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x[0]` is an input integer, `y[0]` is an input integer, `r[0]` is an input integer, `x[1]` is an input integer, `y[1]` is an input integer, `r[1]` is an input integer, `x[2:n]` are `None`, `y[2:n]` are `None`, `r[2:n]` are `None`, `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`**
