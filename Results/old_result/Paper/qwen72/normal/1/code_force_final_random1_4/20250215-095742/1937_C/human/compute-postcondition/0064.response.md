Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `res` is the new input string and its current value is `<`, `k` is the largest index `i` for which the input was `<` if any input was `<`, otherwise `k` remains 1, `best` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to `best`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change in the state is that `best` is now 1.
