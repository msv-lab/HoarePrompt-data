Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged, and `i` is `n + 1`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[n + 1][1]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'F'.***
