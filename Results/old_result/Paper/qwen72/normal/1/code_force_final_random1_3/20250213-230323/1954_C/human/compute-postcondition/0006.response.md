To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - `i`: This is the index used to iterate through the lists `a` and `b`.
   - `len(a)`: This is the length of the list `a`.
   - `a[i]`: The element at index `i` in the list `a`.
   - `b[i]`: The element at index `i` in the list `b`.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input.
   - `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input.
   - `len(a)` is the length of the list `a`.

3. **Condition Breakdown:**
   - `i < len(a)`: This condition checks if the index `i` is within the bounds of the list `a`.
   - `a[i] == b[i]`: This condition checks if the elements at index `i` in both lists `a` and `b` are equal.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes:**
   - For the loop to execute, both conditions must be true:
     - `i < len(a)`: Since `i` is 0, this condition is always true as long as `len(a)` is greater than 0.
     - `a[i] == b[i]`: This condition must be true for the loop to start.

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - `i` is already 0, so no adjustment is needed.
   - `len(a)` must be greater than 0, which is already implied by the problem statement that `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input.
   - `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]` for the loop to execute the first time.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes the first time, the only necessary condition is that the first elements of `a` and `b` must be equal (`a[0] == b[0]`). All other conditions are already satisfied by the given state.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `new` is a list of `None` with the same length as `a`, `new2` is a list of `None` with the same length as `a`, `i` is 0, and `a[0] == b[0]`**
