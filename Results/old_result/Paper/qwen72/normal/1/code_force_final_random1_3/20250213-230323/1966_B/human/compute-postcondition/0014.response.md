To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `m`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for j in range(m - 1):`.
   - The variables involved are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `range(m - 1)` generates a sequence of numbers.
   - For `range(m - 1)` to generate a sequence, `m - 1` must be greater than 0.
   - Therefore, `m` must be greater than 1.

3. **Adjust States:**
   - We need to ensure that `m` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `j` should start at 0, as it is the initial value when the loop starts.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is 0 (initial value for the loop).
- `m` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is different from the last character of the last string in `gr`, `impossible` is True, `j` is 0**
