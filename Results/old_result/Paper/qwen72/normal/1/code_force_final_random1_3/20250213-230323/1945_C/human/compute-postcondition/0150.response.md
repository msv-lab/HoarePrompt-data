Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a new input string, `sl` is a list of characters from the new `s`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of the original `mini` and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of times '0' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of the new `s`, `one` is the number of times '1' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of the new `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, and `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If the length of `final` is 0, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, and if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes the element 0. Otherwise, `final` includes the value `n`.**

Explanation:
- The code `z = sl.count('0')` updates the value of `z` to the number of times '0' appears in the list `sl`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
