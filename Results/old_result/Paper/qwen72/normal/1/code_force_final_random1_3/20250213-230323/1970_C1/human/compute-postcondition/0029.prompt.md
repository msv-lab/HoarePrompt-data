Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, and `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element `(x-1)` times. The values of `a` and `b` will vary for each iteration based on the user input. The initial state of the tree and the initial position of the stone remain unchanged. `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `z`. `one` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
while lst[tmp] != []:
    one = not one
    tmp = lst[tmp].pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is the last element of `lst[z]` before it was popped, `one` is `False`, and `lst[z]` must not be an empty list but now has one less element.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is the last element of `lst[tmp]` before it was popped, `one` is `True`, and `lst[z]` must not be an empty list but now has one less element, and `lst[tmp]` has one less element.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is the last element of `lst[tmp]` before it was popped, `one` is `False`, `lst[z]` must not be an empty list but now has one less element, and `lst[tmp]` has two less elements but must still contain at least one element.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
