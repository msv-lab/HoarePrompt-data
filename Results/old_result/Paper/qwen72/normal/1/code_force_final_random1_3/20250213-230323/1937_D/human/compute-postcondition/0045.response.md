Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `i` is `n - 2`, `B` now includes the value `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2)) * len(idx_B)`, `idx_B` remains unchanged, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2)) * len(idx_B)`**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value of `x` to the list `B`.
- The value of `x` is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2)) * len(idx_B)`.
- All other variables (`s`, `n`, `j`, `A`, `idx_A`, `i`, `idx_B`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `B` is the original `B` with the additional element `x`.
