Postcondition: ***`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user. If `a` is even, `a1` is set to `a // 2`, and `a2` is set to `a // 2`. `b1` is set to `b // 2`, and `b2` is set to `b // 2`. If `b1` is not equal to `a`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped and the program moves to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues with the current iteration.***
