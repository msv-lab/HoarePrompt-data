The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 3, `x` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000, `a[1]` is 1000 + `x[0]`, `a[2]` is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, and all other elements are 0, `i` is 3**
