Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous value), `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be non-zero, but after the last iteration, `n` must still be greater than 0, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `L` is a list containing the values `(n + 1) // 2` and `m`, `a` is undefined, `tot` is undefined, `pow` is undefined, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now `n - ((n + 1) // 2)` and must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The list `L` initially contains the value `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The variable `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The code `L.append(m)` appends the current value of `m` to the list `L`.
- Therefore, `L` now contains two elements: the initial value `(n + 1) // 2` and the new value `m`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `tot`, `pow`) remain unchanged or retain their conditions as specified in the initial state.
