The loop condition checks if `lst[tmp]` is not an empty list (`lst[tmp] != []`). For the loop to execute one more time, `lst[tmp]` must still contain at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration, `lst[z]` has one less element, and `lst[tmp]` has one less element. Since the loop condition depends on `lst[tmp]`, we need to ensure that `lst[tmp]` still contains at least one element for the loop to proceed.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state variables other than ensuring that `lst[tmp]` is not empty. The state remains the same, with the only requirement being that `lst[tmp]` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is the last element of `lst[tmp]` before it was popped, `one` is `True`, and `lst[z]` must not be an empty list but now has one less element, and `lst[tmp]` has one less element but must still contain at least one element**.
