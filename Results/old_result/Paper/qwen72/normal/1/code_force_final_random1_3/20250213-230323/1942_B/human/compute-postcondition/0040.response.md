The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop counter. The loop will execute as long as `_` is within the range specified by `int(input())`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `_` is 1
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element at index `i` is `mex - ar[i]` starting from the last element to the first
- `mex` is the result of subtracting all elements of `ar` from `n` (i.e., `n - sum(ar)`)
- `i` is -1

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1. Since the loop is controlled by the range, the loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`.

State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element at index `i` is `mex - ar[i]` starting from the last element to the first, `mex` is the result of subtracting all elements of `ar` from `n` (i.e., `n - sum(ar)`), and `i` is -1**
