Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 3. The values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain unchanged unless `i` (which was 2) was in `a` or `b` and met the specified conditions, in which case they would have been incremented accordingly. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
