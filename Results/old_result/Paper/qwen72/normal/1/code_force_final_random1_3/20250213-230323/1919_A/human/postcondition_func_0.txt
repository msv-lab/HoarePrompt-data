The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where 1 <= a, b <= 10^9). It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If the sum is even, it returns the string 'Bob'. If the sum is odd, it returns the string 'Alice'. After the function concludes, it will have returned either 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.
