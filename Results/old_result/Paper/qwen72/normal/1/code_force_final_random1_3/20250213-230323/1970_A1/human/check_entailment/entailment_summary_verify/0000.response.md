### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to implement the balanced shuffle operation on a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The operation involves computing the balance of each prefix, sorting the characters based on their balance and position, and then constructing the new sequence from the sorted list.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function is not directly used in the main logic but seems to be a comparison function for sorting. However, it is not used in the provided code, so we can ignore it for now.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function performs the main logic of the balanced shuffle operation.
     - It initializes a list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects, which contain the balance, position, and character.
     - It iterates through the string `s`, updating the balance and appending `BalanceInfo` objects to `balance_info`.
     - It sorts `balance_info` based on the balance in ascending order and position in descending order for ties.
     - It constructs the result string from the sorted `balance_info` and prints it.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary confirms that `func_2` correctly processes the input string, creates `BalanceInfo` objects, sorts them, and constructs the shuffled string.
   - The sorting criteria match the problem description: balance in ascending order and position in descending order for ties.

4. **Validation of the Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation.
   - The code follows the steps described in the problem statement and the function summary.
   - The sorting logic and construction of the result string are consistent with the requirements.
   - The program handles the input constraints and produces the expected output for the given example.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
