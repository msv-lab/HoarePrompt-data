Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `b` is a new list of integers converted from the new input string, `i` is the index up to which `a` and `b` have matching elements or the length of `a` (whichever is smaller) plus 1, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except for the first `i-1` elements which are now `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-2`, and the `i-1`-th element is now `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except for the first `i-1` elements which are now `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-2`, and the `i-1`-th element is now `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `b` is a new list of integers converted from the new input string, `i` is less than the length of `a` and has been incremented by 1, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except for the first `i-1` elements which are now `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-2`, the `i-1`-th element is now `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, and the `i`-th element is now `min(a[i], b[i])`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except for the first `i-1` elements which are now `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-2`, the `i-1`-th element is now `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, and the `i`-th element is now `max(a[i], b[i])`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `b` is a new list of integers converted from the new input string, `i` is less than the length of `a` and has been incremented by 2, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except for the first `i-1` elements which are now `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-3`, the `i-2`-th element is now `min(a[i-2], b[i-2])`, the `i-1`-th element is now `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, and the `i`-th element is now `min(a[i], b[i])`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except for the first `i-1` elements which are now `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-3`, the `i-2`-th element is now `min(a[i-2], b[i-2])`, the `i-1`-th element is now `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, and the `i`-th element is now `max(a[i], b[i])`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `b` is a new list of integers converted from the new input string, `i` is less than the length of `a` and has been incremented by 3, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except for the first `i-1` elements which are now `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-4`, the `i-3`-th element is now `min(a[i-3], b[i-3])`, the `i-2`-th element is now `min(a[i-2], b[i-2])`, the `i-1`-th element is now `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, and the `i`-th element is now `min(a[i], b[i])`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except for the first `i-1` elements which are now `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-4`, the `i-3`-th element is now `min(a[i-3], b[i-3])`, the `i-2`-th element is now `max(a[i-2], b[i-2])`, the `i-1`-th element is now `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, and the `i`-th element is now `max(a[i], b[i])`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
