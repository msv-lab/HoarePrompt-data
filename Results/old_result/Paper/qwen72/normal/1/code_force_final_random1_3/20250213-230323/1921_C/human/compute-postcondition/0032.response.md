Output State: **`i` is `feat[0]`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `array2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `array2` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of the other variables, which remain as they were in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions, with the addition that `array2` is now explicitly an empty list.
