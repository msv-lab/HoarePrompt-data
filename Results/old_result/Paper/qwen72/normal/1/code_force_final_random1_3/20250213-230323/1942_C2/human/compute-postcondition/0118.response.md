Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the new second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the new third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input and must have at least 2 elements, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `tmp` is an empty list. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is increased by 1. If `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is decreased by the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, all variables remain unchanged.***
