Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function computes a new list `res` of `n` elements, where each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`. Here, `mex` starts as `n` and is updated to the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `[mex - ar[i] for i in range(n)]` during the computation. The function prints the resulting list `res` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
