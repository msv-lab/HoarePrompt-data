Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:` is too restrictive. The total number of matches can be greater than 3, and `p3` can be greater than `total_matchs` in certain valid scenarios. For example, consider the input `(0, 0, 6)`. The total points are 6, which is even, and the total matches are 3. However, the program incorrectly returns `-1` because `p3 > total_matchs` is true, even though this is a valid scenario where all games could have ended in draws. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
