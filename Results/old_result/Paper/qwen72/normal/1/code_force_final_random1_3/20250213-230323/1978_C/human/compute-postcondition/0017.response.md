Output State: **The program returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)` where `c` is 2, `k` is `k // 2 - (n - 2) + 1`, and `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)` with `c` being 2 and `l` being the initial value of `l`. If `k` is 0, the program returns the result of `func_3(c, l)` where `c` is 2 and `l` is the initial value of `l`.**
