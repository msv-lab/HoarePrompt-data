Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 2 elements, `j` is 1, `test` is True, and the difference between the second element and the first element of `lis` is greater than 1. If `j` is odd, `j` remains 1. If `j` is even, `j` remains 1.***
