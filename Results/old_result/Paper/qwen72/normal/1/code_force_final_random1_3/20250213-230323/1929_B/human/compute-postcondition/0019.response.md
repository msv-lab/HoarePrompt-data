The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function should accept parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`. Here, `t` represents the number of test cases, `n` represents the size of the square grid, and `k` represents the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, but typically, such a function would return a result based on the given parameters, possibly indicating whether it is possible to color the grid according to the specified conditions or providing a specific configuration.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `n` is the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2). The function returns a result based on these parameters, likely indicating whether it is possible to color the grid according to the specified conditions or providing a specific configuration.**
