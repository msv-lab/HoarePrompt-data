Output State: **`s` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `i` is `s[2]`, `n` and `k` retain their original values, `ans1` is incremented by 1, `z` will be 1 if any element in `s` equals `h`, otherwise it will remain 0, `h` is now equal to the value of `s[0]` (which was originally the value of `s[k-1]`), `j` is 1.**
