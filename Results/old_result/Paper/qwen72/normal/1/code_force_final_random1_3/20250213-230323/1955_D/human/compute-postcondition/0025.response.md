Output State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `_` is a placeholder for iterating over a range determined by a positive integer input, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 (values are taken from input), `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 initialized with all elements set to 0 except for the elements at indices corresponding to the values in `b[:m]`, each of which is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is `cnt_b[a[1]] - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the value at the index `a[1]` in the list `cnt_b` by 1.
- Since `i` is 1, `a[1]` refers to the second element in the list `a`.
- The value at the index `a[1]` in `cnt_b` is decremented by 1.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
