Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an input integer - 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is an input integer - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 1]`, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `best` remains unchanged.** 

Explanation: The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, where `v` is `na_frente - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
