Reasoning:  
The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure it works correctly according to the problem description:

1. **Function `func_1` Issue**: The function `func_1` is supposed to handle the movement of entities on the grid. However, the direction dictionary `mouvements` is defined incorrectly. The movements should be defined as `(dx, dy)` where `dx` affects the x-coordinate and `dy` affects the y-coordinate. The current definition swaps these, which could lead to incorrect movements. Additionally, the function `func_1` should correctly handle the movement within the grid boundaries.

2. **Handling Player Elimination**: When a player is eliminated, the program should correctly handle the case where the player was carrying the Quaffle. The current implementation does not correctly reset the Quaffle's state when a player is eliminated while carrying it.

3. **Scoring Logic**: The scoring logic needs to be corrected. The program should check if the player is at a goal of the opposing team before scoring a point. Additionally, the program should handle the case where a player scores in their own goal, awarding the point to the opposing team.

4. **Quaffle Handling**: The program should correctly handle the Quaffle being thrown and caught. The current implementation has a typo (`quidditch[1] == mo[0]` instead of `quidditch[1] = mo[0]`), which prevents the Quaffle from being correctly assigned to a player.

5. **Final Score Output**: The final score should be printed correctly after all the moves have been processed.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it stands.

Correctness: **False**
