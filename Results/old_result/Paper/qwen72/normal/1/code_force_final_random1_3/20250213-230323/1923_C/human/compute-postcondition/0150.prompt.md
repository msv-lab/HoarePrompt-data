Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; c is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; l_i and r_i are integers for each query where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [0]
    c = [0]
    i, j = 0, 0
    for x in l:
        if x == 1:
            j += 1
        i += x
        p.append(i)
        c.append(j)
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
        s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
        if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _ is m-1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. For each iteration, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the condition is met and 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `m` remain as input integers with `m` being greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are the last set of input integers provided during the final iteration, `i` is the difference between the cumulative count of 1s up to index `b` and the cumulative count of 1s up to index `a - 1` in the list `c`, `s` is the difference between the cumulative sum of elements up to index `b` and the cumulative sum of elements up to index `a - 1` in the list `p`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative sums of elements in `l`, `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative counts of 1s in `l`, `j` is the total count of 1s in the list `l`. For each iteration, if the length of the subarray from index `a` to `b` (inclusive) is greater than 1 and the difference between the sum of elements in the subarray from index `a` to `b` and the length of this subarray is greater than or equal to the difference in the cumulative count of 1s between these indices, then "YES" is printed. Otherwise, "NO" is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is incremented by m, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers read from user input, `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative counts of 1s in `l`, `i` is the count of 1s in the sublist `l[a-1:b]` for each iteration, `j` is the count of 1s in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input for each iteration, `s` is the difference between `p[b]` and `p[a-1]` for each iteration. For each iteration, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The final value of `_` is `m`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
