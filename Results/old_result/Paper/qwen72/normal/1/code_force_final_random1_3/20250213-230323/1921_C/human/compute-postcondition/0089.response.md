Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 0, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `array2` is a list containing one element which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`, `n` must be less than `test_cases`, and `i` is not equal to 0. The difference between the current element `arr[i]` and the previous element `arr[i - 1]` in the `arr` list is less than the result of dividing `b` by `a`.**
