The code snippet `array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)` appends the result of the expression `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to the list `array2`.

Given the initial state:
- `feat` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 2.
- `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list.
- `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list.
- `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `n` must be less than `test_cases`.
- `i` is 2.
- If `i` is 0, `array2` remains an empty list.
- If `i` is 1 and the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.

Since `i` is 2, the condition for `i` being 0 or 1 does not apply. The code will append the value `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a` to `array2`.

Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 2, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` must be less than `test_cases`, `i` is 2, `array2` contains the value `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`.**
