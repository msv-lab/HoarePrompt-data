The value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. This value is then appended to the list `L`, which was initially empty. The value of `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing one element `[m]`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2` before the update to `n`.**
