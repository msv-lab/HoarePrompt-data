Output State: **`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `rest` is updated to `rest - delta`, `pos` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` may be updated depending on the condition, `distance` remains unchanged, and `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` retain their initial values. `rest` is now `rest - delta`, and `rest` must be greater than 0, and `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`.**
