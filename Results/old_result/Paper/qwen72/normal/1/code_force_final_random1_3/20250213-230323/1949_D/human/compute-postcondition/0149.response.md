To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

- The loop is defined as `for j in range(1, n + 1)`. This means the loop will iterate over values starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
- For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. However, given the initial state where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, this condition is already satisfied.
- The variable `j` in the loop head is the loop iterator, which starts at 1 according to the `range(1, n + 1)`.

Given these points, the initial state of `i` and `nx` are not relevant to the loop's ability to execute, but `n` must be within the specified range, and `j` should start at 1.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 1, `nx` is an empty string (`''`)**
