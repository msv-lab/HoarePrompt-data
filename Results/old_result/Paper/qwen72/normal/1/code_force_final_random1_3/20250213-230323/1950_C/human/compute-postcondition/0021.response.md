Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1441.
- `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
- `h` is the substring of `s` from index 0 to 1 (inclusive), which represents the hours part of the time.
- If `h` is '00', the program continues with the current values of `t`, `s`, and `h`.
- If `h` is not '00' and `int(h) <= 12`, the program continues with the current values of `t`, `s`, and `h`.
- Otherwise, if `int(h) > 12`, the program continues with the same values of `t`, `s`, and `h`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Extracting the Minutes (`s[2:]`)**:
   - `s` is a string in the format "hh:mm".
   - `s[2:]` extracts the substring starting from index 2 to the end of the string, which represents the minutes part of the time.
   - For example, if `s` is "12:34", then `s[2:]` will be "34".

2. **Determining AM/PM**:
   - `h` is the hours part of the time, extracted as a substring from `s`.
   - `int(h) >= 12` checks if the hour is 12 or greater.
   - If `int(h) >= 12`, the program selects 'PM'.
   - If `int(h) < 12`, the program selects 'AM'.

3. **Combining the Results**:
   - The `print` statement will output the minutes part of the time followed by either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour.

### Possible Scenarios:
- If `h` is '00', the program continues, and the output will be the minutes part of the time followed by 'AM'.
- If `h` is not '00' and `int(h) <= 12`, the output will be the minutes part of the time followed by 'AM'.
- If `int(h) > 12`, the output will be the minutes part of the time followed by 'PM'.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the minutes part of the time followed by either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the hour.

Output: **[minutes] [AM/PM]** (where [minutes] is the minutes part of the time `s` and [AM/PM] is 'AM' if the hour is less than 12, otherwise 'PM')
