The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'yes'`. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Output: **yes**
