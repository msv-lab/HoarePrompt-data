Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to new input integers, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `count` is 5, `countmins` is 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 4, `g` is `int(n / count) - countmins`, and `ans` remains `n + int(int(n / count) - countmins) / count) + 1 + int((int(n / count) - countmins) / count) + 1`.**
