Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `ad` is a list containing `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`, `bd` is a list containing `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b)-1] - b[len(b)-2]]`, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `len(a) <= len(b)`**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- The placeholders `_`, `n`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged.
- The list `a` remains a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input, with at least `len(a)` elements.
- The list `b` remains a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input, with at least 2 elements.
- The list `ad` remains unchanged, containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
- The list `bd` now contains the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, starting with 0 and ending with the difference between the last two elements of `b`.
- The variable `i` is now equal to `len(b) - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The condition `len(a) <= len(b)` ensures that the loop can complete without errors.
