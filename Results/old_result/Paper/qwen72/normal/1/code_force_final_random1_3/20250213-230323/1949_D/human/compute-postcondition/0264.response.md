To determine what will be printed by the `print(nx)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic used to construct `nx`.

### Initial State:
- `j` is `n + 1`
- `n` remains unchanged
- `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged
- `nx` is constructed by concatenating characters from `xx[i]` where:
  - Each character is the corresponding character from `xx[i]` if it is not '?'
  - If the character is '?', it is replaced by 'S' if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`
  - Otherwise, it is replaced by 'F'

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `j` and `n`**:
   - `j` is `n + 1`, so `j` is always one more than `n`.

2. **Understanding `nx` Construction**:
   - `nx` is built by iterating over the characters in `xx[i]`.
   - For each character in `xx[i]`:
     - If the character is not '?', it is directly added to `nx`.
     - If the character is '?':
       - Check if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.
         - The first quarter of `sb` is the range from 0 to `len(sb) // 4 - 1`.
       - If `i` or `j` is in this range, replace '?' with 'S'.
       - Otherwise, replace '?' with 'F'.

3. **Determining the Output**:
   - Since the exact values of `xx`, `sb`, and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.
   - The output will be a string `nx` where each '?' in `xx[i]` is replaced according to the rules described above.

### Final Output:
The `print(nx)` statement will print the string `nx` constructed by replacing each '?' in `xx[i]` with 'S' if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, and 'F' otherwise.

Output: **nx (where nx is the string constructed by replacing each '?' in xx[i] with 'S' if i or j is in the first quarter of sb, and 'F' otherwise)**
