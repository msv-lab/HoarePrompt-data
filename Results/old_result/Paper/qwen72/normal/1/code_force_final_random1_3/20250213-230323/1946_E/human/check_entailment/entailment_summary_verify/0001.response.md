### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires determining the number of permutations of length \(n\) that match the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the GCD of two numbers and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity.
     - If \(b = 0\), it returns \((1, 0)\).
     - If \(a < b\), it swaps \(a\) and \(b\) and calls itself recursively.
     - If \(a \% b = 0\), it returns \((1, -(a // b - 1))\).
     - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with \(b\) and \(a \% b\) and adjusts the results.
   - **func_2(a, b)**: This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of \(a\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - It calls `func_1(b, 1000000007)` to get the coefficients.
     - It returns \(c \times a \mod 1000000007\).

3. **Evaluating the Functions**:
   - **func_1**: The implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm is correct. It correctly handles the base cases and recursive calls.
   - **func_2**: The function correctly computes the modular inverse using the result from `func_1`. However, it seems to be missing the actual logic to count the number of valid permutations.

4. **Missing Logic**:
   - The provided functions do not directly address the problem of counting the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The problem requires a more complex algorithm to count the permutations, which is not present in the provided code.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions are mathematically correct for their intended purpose (Extended Euclidean Algorithm and modular inverse), but they do not solve the problem of counting the number of valid permutations.
   - The given program lacks the necessary logic to solve the problem as described.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
