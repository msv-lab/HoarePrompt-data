Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is 1, the first character of the first string in `gr` is different from the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is `m-2`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is `False`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `impossible` is explicitly set to `False` by the code.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
