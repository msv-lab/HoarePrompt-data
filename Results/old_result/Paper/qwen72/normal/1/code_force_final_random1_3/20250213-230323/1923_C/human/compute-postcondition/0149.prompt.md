Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is incremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers read from user input, `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative counts of 1s in `l`, `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `j` is the count of 1s in `l`, and `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
    s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers read from user input, `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative counts of 1s in `l`, `i` is the count of 1s in the sublist `l[a-1:b]`, `j` is the count of 1s in `l`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `m` must be greater than 0, `s` is the difference between `p[b]` and `p[a-1]`. If the length of the sublist `l[a-1:b]` is greater than 1 and the difference between `s` and the length of the sublist `l[a-1:b]` is greater than or equal to `i`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either the length of the sublist `l[a-1:b]` is less than or equal to 1, or the difference between `s` and the length of the sublist `l[a-1:b]` is less than `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers read from user input, `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative counts of 1s in `l`, `i` is now `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `j` is the count of 1s in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, `m` must be greater than 0, `s` is the difference between `p[b]` and `p[a-1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the same conditions hold. Otherwise, the same conditions also hold.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers read from user input, `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative counts of 1s in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from user input, `i` is now `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `j` is the count of 1s in `l`, `m` must be greater than 0, `s` is the difference between `p[b]` and `p[a-1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, the same conditions hold. Otherwise, the same conditions also hold.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
