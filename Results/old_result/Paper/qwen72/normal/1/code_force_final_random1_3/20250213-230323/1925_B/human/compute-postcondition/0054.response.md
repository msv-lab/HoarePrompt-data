To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `x` is the first integer from the new input.
   - `n` is the second integer from the new input.
   - `q` is 1.
   - `i` is \( \text{int}(\sqrt{x}) + 1 \).
   - `ans` is initialized to 1.

2. **Conditions for `ans`:**
   - `ans` is the maximum value of `i` such that:
     - `x % i == 0` (i.e., `i` is a divisor of `x`)
     - `x - n * i >= 0` (i.e., `n * i` does not exceed `x`)
     - `(x - n * i) % i == 0` (i.e., `x - n * i` is divisible by `i`)
   - Alternatively, `ans` is the maximum value of `x // i` such that:
     - `x % i == 0` (i.e., `i` is a divisor of `x`)
     - `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` (i.e., `n * (x // i)` does not exceed `x`)
     - `x // i > 0` (i.e., `x // i` is a positive integer)
     - `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` (i.e., `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`)

3. **Determine `ans`:**
   - We need to find the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` that satisfies the conditions.
   - Start with `i = int(sqrt(x)) + 1` and check downwards to 1.
   - For each `i`, check if it satisfies the conditions:
     - If `i` is a divisor of `x` and meets the other conditions, update `ans` to `i`.
     - If `x // i` is a valid candidate and meets the conditions, update `ans` to `x // i`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - If no such `i` or `x // i` is found, `ans` remains 1.

Given the complexity of the conditions, the exact value of `ans` depends on the specific values of `x` and `n`. However, the output will always be the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` that satisfies the conditions, or 1 if no such value exists.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum value of i or x // i that satisfies the given conditions, or 1 if no such value exists)**
