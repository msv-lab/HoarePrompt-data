#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and `position` is a positive integer representing the position of the character in the input sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance of infoA and the balance of infoB, where `balance` represents the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence. Since the balances are different, the result is a non-zero integer.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer representing the balance of a prefix in a parentheses sequence, and `position` is a positive integer representing the position of the character in the input sequence. Additionally, `infoA.balance` is equal to `infoB.balance`.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between `infoB.position` and `infoA.position`. Since both `infoA` and `infoB` have the same `balance`, the returned value represents the distance between the positions of the characters in the input sequence that have the same balance.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `infoA` and `infoB`, which are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`. It returns the difference between the balances if they are different, resulting in a non-zero integer. If the balances are the same, it returns the difference between the positions of the characters, representing the distance between the positions of the characters in the input sequence that have the same balance.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing `n` elements, where each element is a `BalanceInfo` object representing the balance, index, and character at each position in `s`. The final `balance` will be 0 because `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: s (where s is a balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and its length does not exceed 500,000)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", ")" with a maximum length of 500,000. It processes the string to create a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, each containing the balance, index, and character at each position in `s`. After sorting this list based on the balance and position, it constructs a new string from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects and prints this new string, which is a rearranged version of the original balanced parentheses sequence. The function does not return any value.
