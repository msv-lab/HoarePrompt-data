The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in `a`, the loop will continue to execute.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user that must have at least 1 element, and `x` is the first element in `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `x` will be the second element in `a`.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is `math.floor(x / 2)`, `x` is the second element in `a`**
