To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

```python
while nums.get(start, 0):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `nums.get(start, 0)` returns a non-zero value. This means that `start` must be a key in the `nums` dictionary, and its corresponding value must be greater than 0.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers where \( 0 \leq \text{arr}[i] < \text{len}(\text{arr}) \).
   - `nums` is a `Counter` object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
   - `start` is 0.
   - `vis` is an empty set.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop condition depends on `start` and `nums`.
   - For the loop to execute, `nums.get(start, 0)` must return a value greater than 0.
   - Since `start` is 0, `nums.get(0, 0)` must be greater than 0.

4. **Ensuring the Condition**:
   - The `Counter` object `nums` should have a non-zero count for the key 0. This means that the integer 0 must appear at least once in the list `arr`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure that the loop executes at least once, the integer 0 must be present in the list `arr`, and thus, `nums[0]` must be greater than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5). `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `nums[0]` must be greater than 0. `start` is 0. `vis` is an empty set.**
