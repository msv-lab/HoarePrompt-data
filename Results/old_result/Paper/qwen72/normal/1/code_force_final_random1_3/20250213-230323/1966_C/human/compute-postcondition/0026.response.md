The value of `dp` is updated based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` or the negation of the current value of `dp`. 

- If `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` is `True`, then `dp` becomes `True`.
- If `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` is `False`, then `dp` becomes the opposite of its current value (`not dp`).

Given the initial state:
- `tc` is an input integer where 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `dp` is `True` if `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1`, otherwise `dp` is `False`

After executing the code:
- If `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` is `True`, `dp` remains `True`.
- If `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` is `False`, `dp` becomes `False` if it was `True` initially, or remains `False` if it was `False` initially.

Output State: **`tc` is an input integer where 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4 - 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `dp` is `True` if `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` or `dp` was already `True`, otherwise `dp` is `False`.**
