You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 0 ≤ arr[i] < len(arr), and the length of arr is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).
def func_1(arr):
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    start = 0
    vis = set()
    while nums.get(start, 0):
        vis.add(start)
        
        nums[start] -= 1
        
        if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
            nums[start + 1] -= 1
            start += 1
        else:
            print(start + 1)
            return
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `arr` remains a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5). `nums` is a Counter object where the frequencies of the integers in `arr` have been adjusted according to the loop's operations. Specifically, for each integer `i` that was visited (`i` in `vis`), `nums[i]` has been decremented by 1, and if `i + 1` was also visited, `nums[i + 1]` has been decremented by 1. The variable `start` will be the last index that was processed before the loop terminated, and `vis` will contain all the indices that were visited during the loop's execution. If the loop completes without encountering a condition where `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is false, it will print `start + 1` and terminate.
    print(start)
    #This is printed: n - 1 (where n is the length of the list `arr`)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and may modify a list `nums` and a set `vis`. It either returns `None` or does not return any value. If modifications occur, `nums[0]` is decreased by 1, and depending on the value of `start`, `nums[1]` or `nums[2]` may be decreased by 2. The set `vis` will contain the elements 0 and 1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None.

Case_2: The program does not return any value.

Case_3: The program does not return any value. The final state is as follows: `nums[0]` is decreased by 1, if `start` is 1 then `nums[1]` is decreased by 2, and if `start` is 2 then `nums[2]` is decreased by 2. The set `vis` contains the elements 0, 1, and 1, but since sets cannot contain duplicate elements, it effectively contains 0 and 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
