The provided code snippet only reassigns the `alp` list, which does not change any of the other variables in the initial state. Here is the detailed reasoning:

- `alp` is reassigned to a list of lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `l`, `array`, `rev_array`, `ans`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of the new `array`, `ans` is a list of length `l` where each element corresponds to the letter in `alp` based on the count of the respective element in the new `rev_array` starting from that index, `j` is `l-1`.**
