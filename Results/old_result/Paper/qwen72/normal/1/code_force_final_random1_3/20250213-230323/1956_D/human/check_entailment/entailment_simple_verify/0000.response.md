### Reasoning:

1. **Scope Issue in `func_2`:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the `ops` list is not passed to the `recursive_maximize_sum` function. This is indeed a significant issue because `recursive_maximize_sum` relies on `ops` to store the operations performed. Without passing `ops`, the function will raise a `NameError` when it tries to append to `ops`.

2. **Logical Flaw in `recursive_maximize_sum`:**
   - The condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):` is intended to check if the sum of the elements in the segment `[l, r]` is less than or equal to the square of the length of the segment. However, this condition does not directly relate to the MEX operation, which is the core of the problem.
   - The MEX operation should be applied to the segment `[l, r]` to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the segment and then set all elements in the segment to this value. The current logic does not correctly compute the MEX value and apply it.

3. **Example Input Analysis:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     3
     1 2 3
     ```
   - The expected output is:
     ```
     6 0
     ```
   - The provided code will not handle this case correctly because it does not correctly compute and apply the MEX value. The MEX value for the segment `[1, 2, 3]` is `0`, but the code does not set the elements to `0` or any other value that maximizes the sum.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program has both a scope issue and a logical flaw in the MEX computation and application. These issues prevent the program from correctly solving the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
