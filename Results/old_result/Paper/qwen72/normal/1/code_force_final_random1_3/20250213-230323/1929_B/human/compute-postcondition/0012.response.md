Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `n` is the first integer from the new input, and `k` is the second integer from the new input. If \(4 \times n - 2\) equals `k`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not hold true.***
