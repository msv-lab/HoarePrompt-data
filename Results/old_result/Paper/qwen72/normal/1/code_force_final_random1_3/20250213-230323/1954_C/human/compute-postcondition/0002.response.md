Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input.** 

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, list(input())))` reads a new input from the user, converts each character of the input string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `b`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
