### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game where they can either swap wallets or keep their own, and then remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin from a non-empty wallet) loses.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game is symmetric, and the total number of coins (a + b) plays a crucial role in determining the winner.
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always win because he can mirror Alice's moves. This is because after each pair of moves (one by Alice and one by Bob), the total number of coins decreases by 2, and the parity (even or odd) remains the same.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win because she can force Bob into a position where he cannot make a valid move.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1(a, b):**
     - This function checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
     - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
     - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
     - This logic is correct based on the key insight above.

   - **func_2():**
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner, and appends the result to a list.
     - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.
     - This function correctly handles multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to determine the winner for each case.

4. **Annotations and State Verification:**
   - The annotations provided for both functions accurately describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The initial state assumptions are correct: `a` and `b` are positive integers within the specified range, and `t` is a positive integer within the specified range.
   - The function `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results as expected.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Both functions are implemented correctly and follow the logic required to solve the problem.
   - The solution correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
