The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition but operates under the context where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. The function processes these inputs and returns the result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes a number of signs and their periodicities. It returns the result for each test case based on the provided periodicities.**
