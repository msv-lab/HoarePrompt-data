The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` from its current value. The value of `a` remains unchanged, and all other variables remain unchanged as well.

Output State: **The value of `a` is updated to the calculated value, `b` is now equal to `b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`, and all other variables remain unchanged.**
