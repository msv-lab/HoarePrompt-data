Postcondition: ***`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is `max_p - 3`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, and `max_p` must be greater than or equal to 3. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 3]`. If `y` (which is `max_p - 3`) equals 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `custo` is incremented by `a_values[max_p - 3]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
