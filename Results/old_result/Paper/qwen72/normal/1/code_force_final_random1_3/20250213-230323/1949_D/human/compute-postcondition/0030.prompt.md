Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if x[j - 1] == 'F':
        a[i] += 1
        a[j] += 1
    elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
        b[i] += 1
        b[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, and `j` is an integer starting at 1 and incrementing up to `n`. If the character at position `j - 1` in the list `x` is 'F', the value at index `j` in the list `a` is incremented by 1. If the character at position `j - 1` in the list `x` is 'S', the value at index `j` in the list `b` is incremented by 1. If the character at position `j - 1` in the list `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, and `j` is an integer starting at 2 and incrementing up to `n + 1`. If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', the value at index `j` in the list `a` is incremented by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', the value at index `j` in the list `b` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `b[j]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, and `j` is 3. If the element at index `j - 1` (which is 2) in the list `x` is 'F', then the element at index 3 in the list `a` is incremented by 1. If the element at index `j - 1` in the list `x` is 'S', then the element at index 3 in the list `b` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the lists `x`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
