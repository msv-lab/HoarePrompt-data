Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers from the latest user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is the new input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the last user input.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `m = int(input())` updates the value of `m` to a new integer input provided by the user.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `j`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `j` is derived from the new value of `m` as `j = m - 1`.
- The initial conditions for `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `x`, and `y` are still valid and unchanged.
