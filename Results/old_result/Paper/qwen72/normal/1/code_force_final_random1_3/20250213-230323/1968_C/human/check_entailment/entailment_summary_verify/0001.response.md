### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list `x` containing `n-1` integers.

2. **Array Initialization:**
   - The array `a` is initialized with `n` elements, all set to 0 initially.

3. **Setting the First Element:**
   - The first element `a[0]` is set to 1000. This is a valid choice because it ensures that `a[0]` is greater than any possible value of `x[i]` (since `1 \le x_i \le 500`).

4. **Constructing the Array `a`:**
   - For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where `1 \le i < n`), the value is set to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.
   - This ensures that `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i-1]` because `a[i]` is exactly `a[i-1]` plus `x[i-1]`, making the remainder `x[i-1]`.

5. **Output:**
   - The constructed array `a` is printed for each test case.

### Verification:

- **Constraints:**
  - The constraints are respected: `1 \le a_i \le 10^9` and `1 \le x_i \le 500`.
  - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 \cdot 10^5`.

- **Correctness:**
  - The construction of `a` ensures that `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i-1]` for all `2 \le i \le n`.
  - The initial value of `a[0]` being 1000 is a safe choice because it is greater than any possible value of `x[i]`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly constructs the array `a` such that the conditions are satisfied for all test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
