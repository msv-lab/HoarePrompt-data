Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input.** 

Explanation: The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which are then converted to integers and stored in the list `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.
