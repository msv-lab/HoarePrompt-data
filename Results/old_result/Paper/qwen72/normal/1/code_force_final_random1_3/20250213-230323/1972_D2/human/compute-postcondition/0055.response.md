Output State: **After all iterations, `x` is the smallest integer such that `x * x > n`, `y` is 1, and `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.**

### Explanation:
- **`x`**: The loop continues as long as `x * x <= n`. Therefore, after all iterations, `x` will be the smallest integer such that `x * x > n`.
- **`y`**: The variable `y` is reset to 1 at the beginning of each iteration of the outer loop. Since the loop terminates when `x * x > n`, the final value of `y` will be 1.
- **`cnt`**: The variable `cnt` accumulates the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. This accumulation happens for all valid pairs `(x, y)` across all iterations of the loop.

This output state reflects the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
