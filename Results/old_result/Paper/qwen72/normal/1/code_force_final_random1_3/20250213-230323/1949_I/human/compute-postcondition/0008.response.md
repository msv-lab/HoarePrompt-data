The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 1, `x` is a list where `x[0]` is the first integer from the input and the rest are None, `y` is a list where `y[0]` is the second integer from the input and the rest are None, `r` is a list where `r[0]` is the third integer from the input and the rest are None, `visited` is a list of False values of length n, `coef` is a list of None values of length n**
