Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `n` remains the same as the initial value, `i` is `n + 1`, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[n]` contains the final computed value based on the given recurrence relation.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged from its initial value.
- The loop variable `i` will be `n + 1`, indicating that the loop has run from 3 up to `n`.
- The array `dp` will have been populated with values according to the recurrence relation provided, with `dp[1]` still being 1, `dp[2]` still being 3, and `dp[n]` containing the final computed value modulo 1000000007.
