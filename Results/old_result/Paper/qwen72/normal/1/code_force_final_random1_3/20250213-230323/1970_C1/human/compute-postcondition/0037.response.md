Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element `(x-2)` times, `z` is an input integer and must be equal to `b`, `tmp` is now equal to the last element of `rev[b]` before the pop operation, `one` alternates between `True` and `False` depending on the number of iterations, `two` is `True`, all lists in `lst` that were initially non-empty are now empty, and `rev[tmp]` must not be empty, `tmp` is now the second-to-last element of `rev[b]` (if it exists).**

Explanation:
- The line `tmp = rev[tmp].pop()` removes the last element from the list `rev[tmp]` and assigns it to `tmp`.
- Since `tmp` was previously set to the last element of `rev[b]`, the new `tmp` is now the second-to-last element of `rev[b]` (if it exists).
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
