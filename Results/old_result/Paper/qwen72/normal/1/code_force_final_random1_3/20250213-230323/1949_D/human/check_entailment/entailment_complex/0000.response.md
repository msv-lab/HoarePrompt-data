### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input, storing the transition matrix in the list `xx` and updating the counts of funny and scary transitions for each scenario in the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Categorization of Scenarios**:
   - The program categorizes scenarios into two lists: `sa` (scenarios with only funny transitions) and `sb` (scenarios with only scary transitions).
   - This categorization is done by checking the counts in `a` and `b`.

3. **Handling Undecided Transitions**:
   - If the number of funny scenarios (`len(sa)`) is greater than or equal to the number of scary scenarios (`len(sb)`), the program assigns the first `n // 4` undecided transitions to 'F' and the rest to 'S'.
   - Conversely, if the number of scary scenarios is greater, the program assigns the first `n // 4` undecided transitions to 'S' and the rest to 'F'.

4. **Output**:
   - The program constructs and prints the final transition matrix, ensuring that the constraints are met:
     - No more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type.
     - All '?' characters are replaced with either 'F' or 'S'.
     - The symmetry of the matrix is maintained (i.e., the i-th character of the j-th line and the j-th character of the i-th line are the same).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where there are no pre-decided transitions (all '?') or where all transitions are already decided.
   - The program ensures that the constraints are met for all permutations of scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements and constraints. It categorizes scenarios, assigns undecided transitions, and ensures the output meets the specified conditions.

**Correctness: True**
