Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to its original value, `i` has been reset to `n - m - 1`, `n` is greater than `m`, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations, if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` met or exceeded `k`, if `curr` is less than `k`, `ans` remains unchanged, `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for all `i` in `b_values`.**

### Explanation:
- **`m`**: Remains greater than or equal to its original value.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will have cycled through all elements in `b_values` and will be reset to `n - m - 1`.
- **`n`**: Remains greater than `m`.
- **`cnt_b[b[j]]`**: For each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1.
- **`b_values`**: This set contains unique elements from the list `b`.
- **`curr`**: After all iterations, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative.
- **`ans`**: If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` during any iteration, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each such iteration. If `curr` is less than `k`, `ans` remains unchanged.
- **`cnt_b[i]`**: For all `i` in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is reset to 0 after the loop completes.
