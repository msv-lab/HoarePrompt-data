Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the price of two yogurts at the promotion price is less than twice the price of one yogurt, but it is still beneficial to use the promotion for part of the purchase and pay the regular price for the rest. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the total cost when the number of yogurts is odd and the promotion price is greater than twice the regular price.

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `1\n3 5 11`
- Expected Output: `15` (since buying 2 yogurts at the promotion price (11) and 1 yogurt at the regular price (5) totals 16, which is more expensive than buying all 3 yogurts at the regular price (15)).
- Actual Output: `16` (the program incorrectly adds the promotion price for 2 yogurts and the regular price for 1 yogurt).

This shows that the program does not always compute the minimum cost correctly.
