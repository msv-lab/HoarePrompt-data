Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of times '0' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of times '1' appears in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` is a list containing all indices `i + 1` where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, and `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, and if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes `0` as its last element. Otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` includes `n` as its last element. If `len(final) != 0`, `final` remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains `t - 1` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains the same input integer greater than 1.
- **`s`**: Remains the same input string.
- **`sl`**: Remains the list of characters from `s`.
- **`pk`**: Remains `n / 2`.
- **`o`**: Remains the number of times '1' appears in `sl`.
- **`z`**: Remains the number of times '0' appears in `sl`.
- **`mini`**: Remains 100000000.
- **`i`**: After the loop, `i` is `n - 2` because the loop runs from `0` to `n - 2`.
- **`zero`**: Counts the number of '0's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`.
- **`one`**: Counts the number of '1's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`.
- **`zero_perc`**: Is calculated as `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`.
- **`one_perc`**: Is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // 1`.
- **`lst`**: Contains all indices `i + 1` where `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50.
- **`final`**: Is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. If `lst` is empty, `final` is updated based on the value of `c1`.

This final state reflects the complete execution of the loop and the resulting values of the variables involved.
