Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `array2` now contains either one or two elements. If the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, `array2` contains two elements: the first element is `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * feat[2]`, and the second element is `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * feat[2]`. Otherwise, `array2` contains one element: `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * feat[2]`.**
