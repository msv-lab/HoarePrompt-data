Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input format correctly for multiple test cases. According to the problem description, the input consists of multiple test cases, and the first line of the input contains the number of test cases `t`. However, the function `func_1` reads the values of `n` and `m` directly from the input without considering the number of test cases. This means that `func_1` will only process the first test case and will not handle the remaining test cases.

To fix this, the function `func_2` should read the number of test cases `t` and then call `func_1` for each test case. Additionally, the input reading inside `func_1` should be adjusted to ensure it processes the correct values of `n` and `m` for each test case.
