Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `4 + n + 2 * q + n + 1 + 2 * q + 2`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[1]` is now `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers initialized to 0, `mp` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs `{0: [0], pf[1]: []}`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional empty string at the end, `i` is 1, `pf[1]` is `a[1]`, and `pf[i]` is not a key in the dictionary `mp`.**

Explanation:
- The code `mp[pf[i]] = []` adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary `mp` where the key is `pf[1]` (which is equal to `a[1]`) and the value is an empty list `[]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
