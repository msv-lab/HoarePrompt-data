You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). It then performs a series of calculations to compute a value `ans` based on `n` and `m`. The final computed value `ans` is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates. The state after the function concludes includes the final values of `n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g` as described in the annotations, but the primary output is the printed values of `ans` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program fails to correctly count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Initialization of `ans`**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, which is incorrect. The correct initialization should be `0` because we are counting pairs, and initially, there are no pairs counted.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Pairs**:
   - The loop that increments `count` from `2` to `m` is not correctly implemented. The logic inside the loop is flawed and does not correctly count the pairs that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, when \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\), the only valid pair is \((1, 1)\), but the program's output is `2` instead of `1`.

### Example Case:
- For the input `1 1`, the correct output should be `1` because the only valid pair is \((1, 1)\). However, the program outputs `2`, which is incorrect.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and thus, the correctness is **False**.
