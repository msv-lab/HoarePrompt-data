Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` and `b` are updated to the positive integers provided by the input, and `i` is 0. If both `a` and `b` are even, no further changes occur. If either `a` or `b` is odd, then the following applies: if `a - b == -a`, then `a` is used; if `b - a == -b`, then `b` is used. If neither of these conditions is true, the difference between `a` and `b` remains non-divisible by 2 if it was initially non-divisible, and remains divisible by 2 if it was initially divisible.***
