Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)`. If `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements` also has the entry `line[ind]: (0, 2)`. `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input that must have at least two strings, and `ind` is 2. If `line[ind]` is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the entry `line[2]: False` if `line[2]` represents a player, otherwise `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary `{}`. `goal` is a list containing two lists. If `line[2]` represents a player, `goal` remains unchanged. If `line[2]` does not represent a player and the second character of `line[2]` is 'G', `goal` contains the tuple `(0, 0)` in the second list if the first character of `line[2]` is 'B', otherwise it contains the tuple `(0, 2)` in the appropriate list based on the first character of `line[2]`. If `line[ind]` is '..', `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary `{}` and `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists.***
