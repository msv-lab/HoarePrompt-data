Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `test_cases` is greater than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, and `array2` contains the values `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * feat[2]` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[j] - arr[j-1]` is less than `b / a`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, which is the last index the loop iterates over.
- The variable `n` remains as it was initially, which is `feat[0]`.
- The variables `f`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, holding their initial values `feat[1]`, `feat[2]`, and `feat[-1]` respectively.
- The variable `test_cases` remains greater than `n`.
- The list `arr` remains the same list of integers input by the user.
- The list `array2` will contain the differences between consecutive elements of `arr` (from the second element to the last) multiplied by `feat[2]`, but only for those differences that are less than `b / a`.
