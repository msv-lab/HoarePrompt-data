Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list containing the single element 0.** 

The code initializes the list `p` with a single element, 0. All other variables (`t`, `int(input())`, `_`, `n`, `m`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
