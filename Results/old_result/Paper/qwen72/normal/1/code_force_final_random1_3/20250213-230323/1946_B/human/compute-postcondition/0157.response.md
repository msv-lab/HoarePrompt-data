The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts three parameters for each test case: `t`, `n`, and `k`, and an array `a`.

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the array and the number of operations, respectively.
  - The array `a` consists of `n` integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

The function processes each test case and returns the result of the operations performed on the array `a` for each test case. The exact nature of the operations is not specified, but the function is expected to handle up to 2 · 10^5 operations and array lengths across all test cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of test cases `t`, the length of the array `n`, the number of operations `k`, and the array `a`. It processes each test case and returns the result of the operations performed on the array `a` for each test case.**
