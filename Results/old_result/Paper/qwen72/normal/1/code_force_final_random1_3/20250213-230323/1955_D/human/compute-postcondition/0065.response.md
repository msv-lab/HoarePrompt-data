To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, we focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and `m`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `i` is 1.
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ n.
- `n` must be greater than `m`.
- Other variables (`b_values`, `cnt_b`, `curr`, `t`, `k`, `b`, `max_val`, `ans`) are not directly involved in the loop condition.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i in range(n - m)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < n - m`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than `m`.
3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The new value of `i` will be 2.
   - The condition `i < n - m` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `n` must still be greater than `m` for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is non-negative, `curr` is incremented by 1. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than `m`, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ m, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, and `curr` is the number of elements in `a[:m]` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative. If `curr` is at least `k`, then `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
