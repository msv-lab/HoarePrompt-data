Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ntest` must be greater than 0, `itest` is 0, `a` is updated to a new list of integers provided by the user input.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `n` integers, but the code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates `a` to a new list of integers provided by the user input.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ntest`, `itest`) remain unchanged.
- The new list `a` contains integers that are converted from the user input, which is split by spaces and then mapped to integers.
