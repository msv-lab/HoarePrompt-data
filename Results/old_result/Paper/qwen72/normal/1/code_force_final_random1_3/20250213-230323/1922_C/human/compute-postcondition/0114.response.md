Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer (greater than or equal to 3), `l` is a list of integers from the latest user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is the new input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are the integers provided by the last user input, and the loop will execute again if the new input value is greater than 2.**
