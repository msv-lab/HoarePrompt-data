Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 4 elements, `j` is 3, `test` is True.*** 

Explanation: Since both the if part and the else part result in the same postconditions, the overall postcondition remains unchanged regardless of whether the condition `j % 2 == 1` is true or false.
