#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is a positive integer less than n representing the number of edges to be removed, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (v, u) represents an edge between vertices v and u, with 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n.
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
        solve()
        
    #State: The loop has executed the specified number of times as determined by the input. `n` remains a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` remains a positive integer less than `n` representing the number of edges to be removed, and `edges` remains a list of tuples where each tuple `(v, u)` represents an edge between vertices `v` and `u`, with `1 ≤ v, u ≤ n`. The function `solve()` has been called the specified number of times, but its specific effects on the state are unknown.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer from standard input, indicating the number of iterations to perform. It then calls the `solve` function that many times. The function itself does not directly accept any parameters or return any values. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the unchanged `n`, `k`, and `edges` variables, and the side effects of calling `solve` multiple times, which are not specified in the provided code.
