The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.

The function returns a list `ans` in reverse order, where `ans` contains `n` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the cumulative product of the elements in `b` (from the last to the first) taken modulo `m`. The cumulative product is calculated as the product of all elements in `b` taken modulo `m`.
