Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and must be greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing two elements `[0, l[0]]`, `i` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])` appends the sum of the first element of `suf` (which is 0) and the first element of `l` to the list `suf`. As a result, `suf` now contains two elements: `[0, l[0]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
