Output State: **The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases and the integer n for each test case. For example, the function should be defined as `def find_position_of_one(t, n_list):`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `n_list` is a list of integers representing the length of the array a for each test case (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). `n_cases` is an input integer.**
