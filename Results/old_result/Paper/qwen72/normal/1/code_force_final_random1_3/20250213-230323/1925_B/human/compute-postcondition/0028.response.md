The only variable in the loop head is `q`, and the loop iterates based on the value provided by `int(input())`. The loop will execute as long as `q` is less than this value.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `x` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 1.
- `n` is the second integer from the input.
- `q` is 0.
- `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
- `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` such that `x - n * d` is non-negative and divisible by `d`, where `d` is a divisor of `x` and `d` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`. If no such divisor exists, `ans` remains 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must be incremented by 1, and the condition for the loop to continue is that `q` must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `q` is 1, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, and `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` such that `x - n * d` is non-negative and divisible by `d`, where `d` is a divisor of `x` and `d` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`. If no such divisor exists, `ans` remains 1.**
