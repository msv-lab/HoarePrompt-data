Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains the same, `i` is `n - 1`, and `smin` has been updated such that for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin[i + 1]` is set to `suf[i + 1]`; otherwise, `smin[i + 1]` is set to `smin[i]`. The values of `b`, `k`, `j`, `t`, `sm`, and `smin[0]` remain `[0]`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `n` does not change and retains its initial value.
- The variable `i` reaches the value `n - 1` after the loop completes.
- The list `smin` is updated for each iteration of the loop. For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if the element at `suf[i + 1]` is less than the current element at `smin[i]`, then `smin[i + 1]` is set to `suf[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `smin[i + 1]` is set to the current value of `smin[i]`.
- The values of `b`, `k`, `j`, `t`, `sm`, and the first element of `smin` (`smin[0]`) remain `[0]` throughout the loop execution.
