The value of `zero` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial value of `zero` is 1, after the increment, `zero` becomes 2. The conditions and values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `zero_perc`, `one`, `one_perc`, and `lst`) remain the same.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 100, `one` is 0, `one_perc` is `n * 100 // (n - 1)` if the first character of `s` is '0'. If the first character of `s` is not '0': `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is 100. If `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, `lst` is [1].**
