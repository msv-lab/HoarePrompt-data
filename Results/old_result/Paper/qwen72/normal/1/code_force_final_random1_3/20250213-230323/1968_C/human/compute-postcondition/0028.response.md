Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is 1000 plus the sum of the first `i` elements of `x`. All other elements of `a` (if any) are 0, and `i` is `n-1`.**
