To determine what will be printed by the `print(score)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). This is likely the number of test cases, but it doesn't directly affect the calculation of `score`.
   - `n` is an input integer. This represents the number of pairs of integers in the list `l`.
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input. The length of `l` is \(2n\) because it contains pairs of integers.
   - `score` is the sum of every second element starting from the first element in `l`. Specifically, `score` is the sum of `l[0]`, `l[2]`, `l[4]`, ..., `l[2*n-2]`.
   - `i` is \(2 * n - 2\). This is the last index of the elements being summed to compute `score`.

2. **Calculation of `score`:**
   - The list `l` is sorted and contains \(2n\) elements.
   - The elements being summed are at indices \(0, 2, 4, \ldots, 2n-2\).
   - Therefore, `score` is the sum of these elements.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print(score)` statement will print the value of `score`, which is the sum of every second element starting from the first element in the sorted list `l`.

Given the initial state and the calculation, the output will be:

Output: **score (where score is the sum of every second element starting from the first element in the sorted list l)**

This means that the printed value will be the sum of the elements at indices \(0, 2, 4, \ldots, 2n-2\) in the sorted list `l`.
