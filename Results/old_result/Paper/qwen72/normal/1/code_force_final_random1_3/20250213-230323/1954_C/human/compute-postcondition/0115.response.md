To determine what will be printed by the `print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where \(1 \leq x, y < 10^{100}\), and each digit in `x` and `y` is from 1 to 9.
- `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string `x`.
- `b` is a new list of integers converted from the input string `y`.
- `i` is the index up to which `a` and `b` have matching elements or the length of `a` (whichever is smaller).

### Conditions for `new` and `new2`:
- If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`:
  - `new` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` where each element `new[j]` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`.
  - `new2` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` where each element `new2[j]` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`.
- If `i` is equal to the length of `a`:
  - `new` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` where each element `new[j]` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`.
  - `new2` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` where each element `new2[j]` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Determine `i`**:
   - `i` is the index up to which `a` and `b` have matching elements or the length of `a` (whichever is smaller).

2. **Construct `new`**:
   - If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`:
     - `new[j] = max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`.
   - If `i` is equal to the length of `a`:
     - `new[j] = min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`.

3. **Convert `new` to a string**:
   - The `print` statement joins the elements of `new` into a single string.

### Final Output:
- If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, the output will be a string representation of the maximum values of corresponding elements from `a` and `b` up to index `i-1`.
- If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, the output will be a string representation of the minimum values of corresponding elements from `a` and `b` for the entire length of `a`.

Given the conditions, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **a string representation of the elements in `new` (where `new` is constructed based on the conditions described above)**

This means:
- If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, the output will be the string formed by the maximum values of corresponding elements from `a` and `b` up to index `i-1`.
- If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, the output will be the string formed by the minimum values of corresponding elements from `a` and `b` for the entire length of `a`.
