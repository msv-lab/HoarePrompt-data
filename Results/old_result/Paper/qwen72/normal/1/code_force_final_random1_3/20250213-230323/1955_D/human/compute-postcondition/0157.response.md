Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `m` is a positive integer, and `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`. If `a[i]` (which is `a[2]`) is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[2]]` is greater than 0, and if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was greater than or equal to 0 before the decrement, `curr` is incremented by 1, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was less than 0 before the decrement, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and `curr` and `ans` remain unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`, or if `cnt_b[a[2]]` is not greater than 0, or if `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`, `curr`, and `ans` remain unchanged.***
