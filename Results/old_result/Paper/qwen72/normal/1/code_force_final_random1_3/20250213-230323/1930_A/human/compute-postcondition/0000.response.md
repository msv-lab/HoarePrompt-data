To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `_` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. The variable `_` is a placeholder used in the loop and does not need to be explicitly adjusted.
2. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, this value must be greater than 0.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of 2n integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, representing the numbers written on the whiteboard.

To ensure the loop executes, the input value must be greater than 0. Since `t` represents the number of test cases and the loop is iterating over these test cases, the input value should be equal to `t`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and the input value is `t` (which must be greater than 0)**
