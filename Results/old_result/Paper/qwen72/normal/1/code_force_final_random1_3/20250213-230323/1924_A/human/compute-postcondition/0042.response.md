Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop execution, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0, `cur` is the final bitmask value after processing all characters in `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is 'a', and the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
