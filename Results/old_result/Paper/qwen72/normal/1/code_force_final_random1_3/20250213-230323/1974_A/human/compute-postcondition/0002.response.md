The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `x` and `y`.

- `x` and `y` are updated with the new integer values from the input.
- The values of `t`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0.**
