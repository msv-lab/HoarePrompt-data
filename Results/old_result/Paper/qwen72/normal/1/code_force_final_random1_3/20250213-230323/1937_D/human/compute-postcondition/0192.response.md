Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2.
- `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
- `j` is `n`.
- `i` is `2`.
- `r` is one less than its original value.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`**: This is the length of the string `s`.
2. **Variable `i`**: This is set to `2`.
3. **Variable `l`**: This is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the print statement. We need to assume that `l` is a valid index for `idx_A`, which contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.

4. **Expression `n - i`**:
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `i` is `2`.
   - Therefore, `n - i` is `n - 2`.

5. **Expression `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`**:
   - `i` is `2`.
   - `idx_A[l - 1]` is the index of the `l-1`-th '>' character in the string `s`.
   - The expression calculates the difference between `2` and the index of the `l-1`-th '>' character, then multiplies this difference by `2`.

6. **Combining the Expressions**:
   - The final expression is `n - 2 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`.

### Final Calculation:
- Let's denote `idx_A[l - 1]` as `k` for simplicity.
- The expression becomes: `n - 2 + (2 - k) * 2`.
- Simplifying further: `n - 2 + 4 - 2k`.
- This simplifies to: `n + 2 - 2k`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the value of `n + 2 - 2k`, where `k` is the index of the `l-1`-th '>' character in the string `s`.

Output: **n + 2 - 2 * idx_A[l - 1]** (where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `idx_A[l - 1]` is the index of the `l-1`-th '>' character in the string `s`).
