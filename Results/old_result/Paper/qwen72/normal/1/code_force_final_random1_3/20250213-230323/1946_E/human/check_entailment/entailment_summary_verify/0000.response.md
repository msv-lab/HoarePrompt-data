### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly address the problem of counting the number of permutations that match the given prefix and suffix maximums. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of permutations of length \( n \) that match the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The solution should handle multiple test cases and output the count modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function appears to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. However, this is not directly relevant to the permutation counting problem.
   - **`func_2(a, b)`**: This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute a modular inverse and then multiplies it by `a` modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). Again, this is not directly related to the permutation counting problem.

3. **Relevance to the Problem**:
   - The problem requires a combinatorial approach to count permutations that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The provided functions do not perform any operations related to generating or counting permutations. They are focused on modular arithmetic and the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which are not directly applicable to the problem at hand.

4. **Specific Example**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     4 2 3
     1 2
     2 3 4
     ```
     The expected output is `3`, as there are three valid permutations: `[1, 4, 3, 2]`, `[2, 4, 3, 1]`, and `[3, 4, 2, 1]`.
   - The provided functions do not perform any operations that would lead to this result. They are not designed to solve the permutation counting problem.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided functions do not address the problem requirements and will not produce the correct output for the given inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
