Output State: **`tc` is an input integer where 0 < tc ≤ 10^4 - 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `dp` is `True` if any difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is 0) is greater than 1, otherwise `dp` is `False`**.
