Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is odd, or `n-2` if `n` is even, and the program prints 'yes' if it did not break out of the loop during any iteration.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over odd indices starting from 1 up to `n-1` (if `n` is odd) or `n-2` (if `n` is even).
- For each iteration, the loop checks if the current index `i` plus one is less than `n` and if either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`. If either condition is true, the loop breaks and prints 'No'.
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it prints 'yes'.
- After all iterations, the value of `i` will be the last odd index within the range, which is `n-1` if `n` is odd, or `n-2` if `n` is even.
