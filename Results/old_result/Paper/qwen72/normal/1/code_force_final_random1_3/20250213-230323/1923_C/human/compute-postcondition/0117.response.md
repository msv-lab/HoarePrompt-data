Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers read from user input that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is `[0, x, 2 * x]`, `c` is `[0, j]` if `x` is not 1, otherwise `c` is `[0, j + 1]`, `i` is `2 * x`, `j` is 0 if `x` is not 1, otherwise `j` is 2, `x` is the second element of `l`, all other variables (`a`, `b`, `s`) remain unchanged.**
