To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- The only variable that changes is `x`.
- If `x` >= 0, `b` is now equal to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
- Otherwise, `b` remains equal to `B[r - 1]`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `b` based on the value of `x`:**
   - If `x` >= 0, then `b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
   - If `x` < 0, then `b = B[r - 1]`.

2. **Calculate the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`:**
   - `a` is a variable whose value is not specified in the initial state, so we will represent it as `a`.
   - `b` is determined based on the value of `x` as described above.
   - `i` is a variable whose value is not specified in the initial state, so we will represent it as `i`.
   - `l` is a variable whose value is not specified in the initial state, so we will represent it as `l`.
   - `r` is a variable whose value is not specified in the initial state, so we will represent it as `r`.
   - `idx_B` is a list whose values are not specified in the initial state, so we will represent it as `idx_B`.

3. **Expression Calculation:**
   - If `x` >= 0:
     \[
     b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)
     \]
     \[
     \text{Expression} = a * 2 + ((idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)) * 2 + i + 1
     \]
   - If `x` < 0:
     \[
     b = B[r - 1]
     \]
     \[
     \text{Expression} = a * 2 + B[r - 1] * 2 + i + 1
     \]

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:

- If `x` >= 0:
  \[
  \text{Output: } a * 2 + ((idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)) * 2 + i + 1
  \]
- If `x` < 0:
  \[
  \text{Output: } a * 2 + B[r - 1] * 2 + i + 1
  \]

Since the exact values of `a`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `idx_B`, and `B` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 (where b is (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1) if x >= 0, otherwise b is B[r - 1])**
