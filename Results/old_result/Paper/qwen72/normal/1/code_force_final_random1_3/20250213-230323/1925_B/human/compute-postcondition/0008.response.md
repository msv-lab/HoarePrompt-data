Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `q` is 0, `i` is 1, and `x` is divisible by `i`. If `(x - n * i)` is non-negative and `(x - n * i)` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.***
