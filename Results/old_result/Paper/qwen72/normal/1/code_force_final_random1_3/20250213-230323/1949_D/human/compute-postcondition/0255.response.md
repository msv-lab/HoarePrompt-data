Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged. If `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb` (i.e., `sb[:n // 4]`), `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus the string 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus the character 'F'.***
