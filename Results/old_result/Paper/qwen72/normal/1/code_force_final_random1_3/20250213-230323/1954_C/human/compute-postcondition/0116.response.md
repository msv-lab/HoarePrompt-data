To determine what will be printed by the `print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where \(1 \leq x, y < 10^{100}\), and each digit in `x` and `y` is from 1 to 9.
- `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string `x`.
- `b` is a new list of integers converted from the input string `y`.
- `i` is the index up to which `a` and `b` have matching elements or the length of `a` (whichever is smaller).

### Conditions for `new` and `new2`:
- If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`:
  - `new` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` where each element `new[j]` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`.
  - `new2` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` where each element `new2[j]` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`.

- If `i` is equal to the length of `a`:
  - `new` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` where each element `new[j]` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`.
  - `new2` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` where each element `new2[j]` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`.

### Analysis:
- The `print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))` statement will print the elements of the `new2` list concatenated into a single string.

### Determining the Output:
1. **If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`:**
   - `new2[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1` is `min(a[j], b[j])`.
   - For `j` from `i` to `len(a)-1`, `new2[j]` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume it remains undefined or follows some default behavior (which is not specified here).

2. **If `i` is equal to the length of `a`:**
   - `new2[j]` for each `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1` is `max(a[j], b[j])`.

Given that the problem specifies the behavior for both cases, we need to consider the most precise description based on the initial state.

### Final Output:
- If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, the output will be the concatenation of the minimum values of corresponding elements from `a` and `b` up to index `i-1`.
- If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, the output will be the concatenation of the maximum values of corresponding elements from `a` and `b` for the entire length of `a`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the conditions given.

Output: **a string of digits where each digit is the maximum of the corresponding elements from `a` and `b` if `i` is equal to the length of `a`, or the minimum of the corresponding elements from `a` and `b` up to index `i-1` if `i` is not equal to the length of `a`**.
