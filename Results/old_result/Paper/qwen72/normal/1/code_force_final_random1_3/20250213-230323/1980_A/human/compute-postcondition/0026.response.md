The code appends the value of `missing` to the list `results`. The value of `missing` is calculated as the sum of the differences between `m` and each frequency in `freq` where the frequency is less than `m`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the values of `missing` (one more value added), `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string consisting of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `freq` is a list of 7 integers where each element represents the frequency of the corresponding character ('A' to 'G') in the string `a`, `missing` is the sum of the differences between `m` and each frequency in `freq` where the frequency is less than `m`.**
