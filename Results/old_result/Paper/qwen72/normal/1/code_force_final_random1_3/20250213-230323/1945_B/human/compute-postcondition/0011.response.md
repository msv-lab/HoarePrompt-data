Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `a` is the first integer input by the user, `b` is the second integer input by the user, `m` is the third integer input by the user, `mn` is the value of `min(a, b) + m`.** 

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `min(a, b) + m` to the variable `mn`. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged. The new value of `mn` is calculated based on the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
