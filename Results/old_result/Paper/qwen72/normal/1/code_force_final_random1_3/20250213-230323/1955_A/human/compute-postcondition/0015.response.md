Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers from the input.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `B * 2` is less than `C`, no further changes are made.
   - If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`:
     - If `A` is even, no further changes are made.
     - If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(int(A * C / 2))`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Check the Condition `B * 2 < C`:**
   - If this condition is true, no further changes are made, and the print statement will execute with the original values of `A` and `C`.

2. **Check the Condition `B * 2 >= C`:**
   - If this condition is true, we need to check the next condition:
     - **If `A` is even:**
       - No further changes are made, and the print statement will execute with the original values of `A` and `C`.
     - **If `A` is odd:**
       - `X` is set to `A // 2`, but this does not affect the print statement since `X` is not used in the print statement.

3. **Print Statement Execution:**
   - The print statement `print(int(A * C / 2))` will always execute after the conditions are checked.
   - The value of `A` and `C` will be the same as their initial values unless `A` is modified by the conditions, but in this case, `A` is not modified.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the result of the expression `int(A * C / 2)`, where `A` and `C` are the integers from the input.

Output: **int(A * C / 2) (where A and C are the integers from the input)**
