Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a string containing the input with all spaces removed.
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found.
- `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr[::-1]` or `-1` if '1' is not found.
- `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(z.count('0'))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input and `arr`**:
   - `n` is an input integer, which represents the length of the input string.
   - `arr` is the input string with all spaces removed.

2. **Finding `x`**:
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
   - If '1' is not found, `x` is `-1`.

3. **Finding `y`**:
   - `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr[::-1]`.
   - If '1' is not found, `y` is `-1`.

4. **Calculating `z`**:
   - `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.
   - If `x` is `-1` or `y` is `-1`, `z` will be an empty string because the indices will be invalid.

5. **Counting '0' in `z`**:
   - The `count('0')` method counts the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring `z`.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: '1' is found in `arr`.
  - `x` is the index of the first '1'.
  - `y` is the index of the first '1' in the reversed string, which corresponds to the last '1' in the original string.
  - `z` is the substring from the first '1' to the last '1'.
  - The output will be the count of '0' in this substring.

- **Scenario 2**: '1' is not found in `arr`.
  - `x` is `-1`.
  - `y` is `-1`.
  - `z` is an empty string.
  - The output will be `0` because there are no characters in an empty string.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the count of '0' in the substring `z` from the first '1' to the last '1' in `arr`. If '1' is not found, the output will be `0`.

Output: **count of '0' in the substring `z` (where `z` is the substring of `arr` from the first '1' to the last '1', or an empty string if '1' is not found)**.
