The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 3, `2 ** i` evaluates to `2 ** 3`, which is 8. Therefore, the list `ans` is updated to include the value 8.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with new values assigned by `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `l` is the length of the binary string `b` and must be greater than 3. The current value of `k` is 1. `n` is not equal to 2. `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8]`. `i` is 3.**
