N and M are integers such that 3 <= N, M <= 99 and both are odd. The field is represented as a list of N strings, each string containing M pairs of characters separated by spaces, where each pair represents a cell on the field. The pairs can be ".." for an empty cell, "R0" to "R9" or "B0" to "B9" for players, "RG" or "BG" for goals, and ".Q" for the Quaffle. T is an integer such that 0 <= T <= 10000, representing the number of steps in the game. The actions are a list of T strings, each describing an action performed by an entity on the field, including movements (U, D, L, R), catching the Quaffle (C), and throwing the Quaffle (T).
