You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

The current value of `k` is 1. Additionally, `n` is not equal to 2.

    #State: *`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with new values assigned by `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `l` is the length of the binary string `b`. If `k` is 1, `n` is not equal to 2, and `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(l-1)]`. `i` is `l-1`. If `k` is not 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 up to 2^(lk-2), followed by the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and now also includes `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1). `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk` and must be at least 2. `i` is `l-1`.
    return ' '.join(map(str, ans))
    #The program returns a string where each element of the list `ans` is converted to a string and joined by spaces. The list `ans` contains specific elements based on the conditions: if `k` is 1, `ans` is a list of powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. If `k` is not 1, `ans` starts with powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and then includes `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1). Here, `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`. The final string is a space-separated sequence of these values.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function implicitly works with two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n). It returns either the string '1\n2' or a space-separated string of numbers based on the values of `n` and `k`. If `k` is 1, the string represents a sequence of powers of 2. If `k` is not 1, the string includes a more complex sequence involving powers of 2 and specific arithmetic operations on `k`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string '1\n2'.

Case_2: The program returns a string where each element of the list `ans` is converted to a string and joined by spaces. The list `ans` contains specific elements based on the conditions: if `k` is 1, `ans` is a list of powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. If `k` is not 1, `ans` starts with powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and then includes `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1). Here, `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`. The final string is a space-separated sequence of these values.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
