Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is `False`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times, so `gr` will contain `n` input strings after the loop completes.
- The variable `i` is used as the loop counter and will be equal to `n - 1` after the loop finishes (since it starts at 0 and increments up to `n-1`).
- All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `m`, `ans`, and `impossible`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
