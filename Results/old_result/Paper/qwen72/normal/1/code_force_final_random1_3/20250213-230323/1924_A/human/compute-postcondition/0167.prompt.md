Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is 0 if `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the loop, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are greater than 0, `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is 0 if `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the loop, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is 'a' if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, and the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0. If the bit at position `i` in `cur` is not 0, `tmp` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are greater than 0, `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is 0 if `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the loop, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed, `cnt` is less than `n`. If the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, `tmp` is set to 'b', and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the bit at position `i` in `cur` is not 0, `tmp` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are greater than 0, `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is 0 if `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the loop, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed, `cnt` is less than `n`. If the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, `tmp` is set to 'c', and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the bit at position `i` in `cur` is not 0, `tmp` remains an empty string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
