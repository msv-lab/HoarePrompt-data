The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- The value of `r` is initially set based on the value of `s[0]`. If `s[0]` is 'L', `r` is `n - 1`. If `s[0]` is 'R', `r` is `n - 2`.
- After executing `r -= 1`, the new value of `r` will be:
  - If `s[0]` is 'L', `r` becomes `(n - 1) - 1 = n - 2`.
  - If `s[0]` is 'R', `r` becomes `(n - 2) - 1 = n - 3`.

All other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `b`, `l`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list that is constructed based on the value of `s[0]` and now includes `a[r]` appended to it, `l` is 2 if `s[0]` is 'L' or remains 1 if `s[0]` is 'R', `r` is `n - 2` if `s[0]` is 'L' or `n - 3` if `s[0]` is 'R', `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.**
