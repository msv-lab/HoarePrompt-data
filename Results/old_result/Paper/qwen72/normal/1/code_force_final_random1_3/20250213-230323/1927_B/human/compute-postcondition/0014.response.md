The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to the input integer converted to an integer using `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers derived from the input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list of length `l` where each element corresponds to the letter in `alp` based on the count of the respective element in `rev_array` starting from that index, `j` is `l-1`**
