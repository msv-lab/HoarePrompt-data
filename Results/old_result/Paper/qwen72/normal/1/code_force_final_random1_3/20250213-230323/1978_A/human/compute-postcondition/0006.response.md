Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `_` is a throwaway variable that will iterate `t` times, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is now an input integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to the integer input provided by the user. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer.
