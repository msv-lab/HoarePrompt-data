You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and q where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of elements in the array and the number of queries, respectively. The array a contains n integers a_1, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30. Each query is represented by two integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases and the sum of q over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        q = int(data[idx + 1])
        
        idx += 2
        
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        mp = {(0): [0]}
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            if pf[i] not in mp:
                mp[pf[i]] = []
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[idx])
            r = int(data[idx + 1])
            idx += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
            v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
            it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        
        results.append('')
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `idx` will be `3 + t * (n + 2 * q + 2)`, `results` will contain 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, followed by `t` empty strings at the end. The variables `t`, `data`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, and `mp` will remain unchanged for each iteration but will be reset for the next test case.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: 'YES' or 'NO' for each query, followed by `t` empty lines
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each with an array of integers and a set of queries. It accepts the number of test cases, the size of the array, the array itself, and the queries. For each query, it returns a result based on the specified segment of the array.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
