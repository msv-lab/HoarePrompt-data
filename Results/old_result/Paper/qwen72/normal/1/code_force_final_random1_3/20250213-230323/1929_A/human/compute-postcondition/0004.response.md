Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ntest` must be greater than 0, `itest` is 0.**

Explanation: The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. All other variables remain unchanged. The values of `t`, `n`, `ntest`, and `itest` are still within their specified ranges or values. The list `a` now contains the same integers as before, but they are sorted in ascending order.
