Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3, `nx` is the original value of `nx` concatenated with 'F'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24.
- The value of `j` remains 3.
- The value of `nx` is updated by concatenating 'F' to its original value. The original value of `nx` depends on the conditions specified in the initial state, but regardless of what `nx` was initially, it now has 'F' appended to it.
