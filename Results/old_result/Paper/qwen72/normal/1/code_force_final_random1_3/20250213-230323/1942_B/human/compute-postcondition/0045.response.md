To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `ar`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the range function generates valid indices. Specifically, the loop will run if `len(ar) - 1` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

### Initial State:
- `_` is 2
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers derived from the user input
- `res` is a list of `n` elements all set to `None`
- `mex` is `n`
- `i` is -1

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to -1, but it will be reassigned by the loop. Therefore, we don't need to adjust `i` explicitly.
- **`ar`**: The loop will execute if `ar` is not empty. If `ar` is empty, `len(ar) - 1` will be -1, and the loop will not execute.

### Final State:
To ensure the loop executes, `ar` must have at least one element. The initial value of `i` will be set by the loop, so we don't need to adjust it.

State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers derived from the user input and must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements all set to `None`, `mex` is `n`, `i` is -1**
