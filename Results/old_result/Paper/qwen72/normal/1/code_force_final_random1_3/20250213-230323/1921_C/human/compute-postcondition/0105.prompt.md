Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `feat` is updated to a list of integers input by the user, `i` is no longer `n`, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `array2` is an empty list, and `n` must be less than `test_cases`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if i == 0:
        if arr[0] < b / a:
            array2.append(arr[0] * a)
    elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
        array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 0, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` must be less than `test_cases`. If `i` is 0 and `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `arr[0] * a`. If `i` is 0 and `arr[0]` is not less than `b / a`, then `array2` remains an empty list. If `i` is not 0 and the difference between the current element `arr[i]` and the previous element `arr[i - 1]` in the `arr` list is less than the result of dividing `b` by `a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. If `i` is not 0 and the difference between the current element `arr[i]` and the previous element `arr[i - 1]` in the `arr` list is not less than the result of dividing `b` by `a`, then `array2` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` must be less than `test_cases`, `i` is 1. If `i` is 0, `array2` remains an empty list. If `i` is 1 and the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 2, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` must be less than `test_cases`, and `i` is 2. If `i` is 0, `array2` remains an empty list. If `i` is 1 and the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. Otherwise, if `i` is 2 and the difference between `arr[2]` and `arr[1]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`. In all other cases, `array2` remains an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
