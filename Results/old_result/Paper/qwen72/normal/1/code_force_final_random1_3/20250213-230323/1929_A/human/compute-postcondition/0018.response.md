Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it sorts the list `a` and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted list. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The state of the program remains unchanged except for the printed output. **
