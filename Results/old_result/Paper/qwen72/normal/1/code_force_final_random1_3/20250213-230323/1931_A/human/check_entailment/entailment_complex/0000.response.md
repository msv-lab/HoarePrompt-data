Reasoning:

The program aims to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded to a given integer `n`. The logic is divided into three cases based on the value of `n`:

1. **If `n` > 52**: 
   - The program constructs the word by taking the character at position `n - 53` in the alphabet and appending `'zz'` to it. This is because the maximum possible sum for two letters is 52 (`z` + `z`), so if `n` is greater than 52, the third letter must be `z` to maximize the sum, and the second letter must also be `z` to ensure the smallest lexicographical order. The first letter is then chosen to make up the remaining value.

2. **If `n` > 26 and `n` ≤ 52**:
   - The program constructs the word by starting with `'a'`, then taking the character at position `n - 28` in the alphabet, and appending `'z'`. This is because the maximum possible sum for one letter is 26 (`z`), so if `n` is between 27 and 52, the third letter must be `z` to maximize the sum, and the first letter is `'a'` to ensure the smallest lexicographical order. The second letter is then chosen to make up the remaining value.

3. **If `n` ≤ 26**:
   - The program constructs the word by starting with `'aa'` and then taking the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet. This is because if `n` is less than or equal to 26, the sum can be achieved with the first two letters being `'a'` (which contribute 2 to the sum), and the third letter making up the remaining value.

### Verification:
- **Case 1 (n > 52)**:
  - Example: `n = 70`
  - Calculation: `70 - 53 = 17` (position of `r` in the alphabet)
  - Result: `rzz`
  - Correct: The smallest word that sums to 70 is indeed `rzz`.

- **Case 2 (26 < n ≤ 52)**:
  - Example: `n = 48`
  - Calculation: `48 - 28 = 20` (position of `t` in the alphabet)
  - Result: `atz`
  - Correct: The smallest word that sums to 48 is indeed `atz`.

- **Case 3 (n ≤ 26)**:
  - Example: `n = 3`
  - Calculation: `3 - 3 = 0` (position of `a` in the alphabet)
  - Result: `aaa`
  - Correct: The smallest word that sums to 3 is indeed `aaa`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases and produces the lexicographically smallest word for each given `n`. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
