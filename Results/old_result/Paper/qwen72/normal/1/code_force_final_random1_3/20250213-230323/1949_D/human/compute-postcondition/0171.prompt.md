Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is `n + 1`, `nx` is an empty string (`''`).
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sa[:n // 4] or j in sa[:n // 4]:
        nx += 'F'
    else:
        nx += 'S'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 1. If the character at position 0 of `xx[2]` is not `'?'`, then `nx` is the string containing this character. If the character at position 0 of `xx[2]` is `'?'`, then `nx` is 'F' if either `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`; otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2. If `xx[2][1]` is not '?', then `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[2][1]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, then `nx` is updated to `nx + 'F'`. Otherwise, `nx` is updated to `nx + 'S'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3. If `xx[2][2]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is increased by the value at `xx[2][2]`. If `xx[2][2]` is equal to '?', and if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, the postcondition remains as stated. Otherwise, a `NameError` occurs because `nx` is not defined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
