To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4
- `tc` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `gr` is an empty list
- `i` is `n-1`
- `ans` is 'YES'
- `impossible` is `False`

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start from 0. The current value of `i` is `n-1`, which is incorrect for the loop to start properly. Therefore, `i` needs to be set to 0.

Additionally, since `gr` is an empty list, there's no information about `gr[0][0]` or `gr[n-1][m-1]` affecting the loop's execution directly. However, the conditions involving `gr[0][0]` and `gr[n-1][m-1]` are important for the logic inside the loop, but they do not affect the loop's ability to start.

Thus, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is `False`**
