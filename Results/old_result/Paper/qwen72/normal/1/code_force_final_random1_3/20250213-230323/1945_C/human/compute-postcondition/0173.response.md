The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. The loop condition is `i < n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 (since `i` must be less than `n - 1`).

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `one_perc` is 0. If `s[i]` is '0': `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 100, `one` is 0. If the first character of `s` is not '0': `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is 0. If `s[i]` is not '0' and `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 50, `one` is 1 or 2, and `lst` is [1, 2]. Otherwise, `lst` remains [1]**.
