Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5). `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `nums[0]` is now `nums[0] - 1`. `start` is 1. `vis` is a set containing the element 0. `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - 1`.** 

Explanation: The value of `start` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
