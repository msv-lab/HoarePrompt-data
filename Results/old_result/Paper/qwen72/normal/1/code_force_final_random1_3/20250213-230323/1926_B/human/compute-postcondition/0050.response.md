Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `k` is either an empty list or a list containing the count of '1' in `b`, `i` is 2, `a` is greater than 2, and `b` is the user input string. If `b` contains the character '1', `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in `b`. Otherwise, `k` remains an empty list.***
