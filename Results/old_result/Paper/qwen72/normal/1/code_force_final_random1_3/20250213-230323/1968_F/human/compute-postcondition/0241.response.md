Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `l` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, `r` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `idx` is incremented by 2, `x` is assigned the value `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is assigned the leftmost index where `l` can be inserted in `v1` to maintain sorted order, `it2` is assigned the leftmost index where `r` can be inserted in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus 1, `results` now contains one additional element 'YES', and the program continues to the next iteration. All other variables (`mp`, `pf`) remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `results` is updated by appending the string 'YES'.
- All other variables and their values remain as they were before the code execution, except for the changes mentioned above.
