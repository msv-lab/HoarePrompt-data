Reasoning:  

The program is designed to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the key parts of the solution to ensure its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading `n`, `m`, the array `a`, and the command string `s`. This part is correctly implemented.

2. **Function Definition (`func_1`)**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements to be processed, and two pointers `l` and `r` to track the left and right ends of the array `a`.
   - **Processing Commands**: The function iterates over each command in `s`. If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of `a` to `b` and increments `l`. If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of `a` to `b` and decrements `r`. This part correctly simulates the removal of elements based on the commands.
   - **Product Calculation**: After processing all commands, the function calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, taking the result modulo `m` at each step. This ensures that the product is computed correctly and efficiently, even for large values.
   - **Output**: The function returns the results in reverse order to match the order of the commands.

3. **Output Handling**: The main loop prints the results of each test case by calling `func_1` and unpacking the returned list.

### Key Points to Verify:
- **Correct Handling of Commands**: The program correctly handles both 'L' and 'R' commands by updating the pointers and appending the appropriate elements to `b`.
- **Product Calculation**: The product is calculated correctly using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.
- **Order of Output**: The results are returned in reverse order to match the order of the commands, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
