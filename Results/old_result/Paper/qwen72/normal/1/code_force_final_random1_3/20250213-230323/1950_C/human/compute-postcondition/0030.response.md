Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 3 ≤ t ≤ 1442.
- `s` is a new input string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
- `h` is the substring of `s` from index 0 to 1 (inclusive), which represents the hours part of the time.
- If `h` is '00', the program continues with the same values for `t`, `s`, and `h`.
- If `h` is not '00' and `int(h) <= 12`, the program continues with the same values for `t`, `s`, and `h`.
- If `int(h) > 12`, the program continues with the same values for `t`, `s`, and `h`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Extracting the Minutes (`s[2:]`):**
   - `s` is a string in the format "hh:mm".
   - `s[2:]` extracts the substring starting from index 2 to the end, which represents the minutes part of the time.
   - For example, if `s` is "13:45", then `s[2:]` is "45".

2. **Determining AM/PM:**
   - `h` is the substring of `s` from index 0 to 1, representing the hours part of the time.
   - `int(h) >= 12` checks if the hour is greater than or equal to 12.
   - If `int(h) >= 12`, the expression `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]` evaluates to 'PM'.
   - If `int(h) < 12`, the expression `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]` evaluates to 'AM'.

### Possible Scenarios:
- If `h` is '00', the program continues, and since `int('00') < 12`, the output will be the minutes part followed by 'AM'.
- If `h` is not '00' and `int(h) <= 12`, the output will be the minutes part followed by 'AM'.
- If `int(h) > 12`, the output will be the minutes part followed by 'PM'.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the conditions, the print statement will output the minutes part of the time followed by either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour part of the time.

Output: **mm AM/PM (where mm is the minutes part of the time `s` and AM/PM is determined by the hour part `h` of the time `s`)**

For example:
- If `s` is "13:45", the output will be "45 PM".
- If `s` is "07:30", the output will be "30 AM".
