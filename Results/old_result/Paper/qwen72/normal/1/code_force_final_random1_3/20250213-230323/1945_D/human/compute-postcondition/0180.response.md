To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `y`, `max_p`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the starting value of `range(max_p - 1, 0, -1)` is greater than or equal to the stop value (which is 1 in this case). This means `max_p - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1.
3. **Initial Value of `y`**: The initial value of `y` will be `max_p - 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`max_p`**: For the loop to execute, `max_p - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `max_p` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- **`y`**: The initial value of `y` will be `max_p - 1`.

### Final State:
The state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. The other variables (`b`, `b_values`, `num_fila`, and `custo`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is the last string in `b`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `custo` is increased by the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p`, `max_p` must be greater than or equal to 2, `y` is `max_p - 1`**.
