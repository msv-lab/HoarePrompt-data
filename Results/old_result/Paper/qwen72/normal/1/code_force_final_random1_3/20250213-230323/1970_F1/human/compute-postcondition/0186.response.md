Postcondition: ***`obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string in `command`, `pos` is the value associated with `obj` in the dictionary `elements`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`. If `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)` and `points[team]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.***
