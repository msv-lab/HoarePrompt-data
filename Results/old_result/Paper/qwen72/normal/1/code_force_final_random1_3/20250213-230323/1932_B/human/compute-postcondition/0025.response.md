The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0 but less than its value at the start of the previous iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 but less than its value at the start of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user that has been fully iterated over, `year` is the sum of the initial `year` (which was 0) and the result of `(year % ai or ai)` for each element `ai` in the list `a`.**
