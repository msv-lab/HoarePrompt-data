Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous value), `n` is 0, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `L` is a list containing the values `(n_initial + 1) // 2`, `((n_initial // 2 + 1) // 2)`, ..., until `n` becomes 0, `a` is undefined, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is the last value calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0.
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
    tot += a
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `L` is a list containing the values `(n_initial + 1) // 2`, `((n_initial // 2 + 1) // 2)`, ..., until `n` becomes 0, `L` must have at least one element, `a` is the first element in `L`, `tot` is `a`, `pow` is 2, `m` is the last value calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the current conditions remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `L` is a list containing the values `(n_initial + 1) // 2`, `((n_initial // 2 + 1) // 2)`, ..., until `n` becomes 0, `L` has at least one element, `a` is the second element in `L`, `tot` is `a + a`, `pow` is 4, and `m` is the last value calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the current conditions remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `L` is a list containing the values `(n_initial + 1) // 2`, `((n_initial // 2 + 1) // 2)`, ..., until `n` becomes 0, `L` has at least one element, `a` is the third element in `L`, `tot` is `a + a + a`, `pow` is 8, and `m` is the last value calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
