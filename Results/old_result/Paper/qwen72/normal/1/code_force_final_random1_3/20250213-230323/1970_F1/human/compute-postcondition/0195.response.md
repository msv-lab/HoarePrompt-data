Based on the initial state provided:

- `points` is a list that reflects the changes made during the loop based on the commands read from the input.
- The `print` statement will output the values of `points[0]` and `points[1]`.

Since the exact values of `points[0]` and `points[1]` are not explicitly provided, we can only describe them based on the information given:

- `points[0]` and `points[1]` are the scores of two players after all iterations of the loop.
- These scores are updated based on the commands read from the input during the loop.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where [points[0]] and [points[1]] are the final scores of the two players after all iterations of the loop)**
