Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^9.
- `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9 and has been updated to `b + c`.
- `c` is an integer between 0 and 10^9.

### Print Statement:
```python
print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `b` has been updated to `b + c`.
   - The expression inside the print statement is a tuple with two elements: `(a - -b // 3, -1)`.
   - The index of the tuple is determined by the condition `c < b % 3`.

2. **Evaluate the Condition `c < b % 3`:**
   - `b % 3` gives the remainder when `b` is divided by 3. Since `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `b % 3` can be 0, 1, or 2.
   - `c` is an integer between 0 and 10^9.
   - The condition `c < b % 3` will evaluate to either `True` or `False`.

3. **Determine the Tuple Index:**
   - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the index is 1.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the index is 0.

4. **Evaluate the Tuple Elements:**
   - The first element of the tuple is `a - -b // 3`.
     - `-b` is the negation of `b`.
     - `-b // 3` is the floor division of `-b` by 3.
     - `a - -b // 3` simplifies to `a + b // 3` because `- -b` is `b`.
   - The second element of the tuple is `-1`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the print statement will output `-1`.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the print statement will output `a + b // 3`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement depends on the condition `c < b % 3`.

Output: **-1 if c < b % 3, otherwise a + b // 3 (where a is an integer between 0 and 10^9, b is an integer between 0 and 10^9 updated to b + c, and c is an integer between 0 and 10^9)**
