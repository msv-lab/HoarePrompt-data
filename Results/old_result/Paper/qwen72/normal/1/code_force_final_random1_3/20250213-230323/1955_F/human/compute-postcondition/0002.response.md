Let's break down the code step by step to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `p_i` are integers such that \(0 \leq p_i \leq 200\).
- `p` is a list of the nearest even numbers derived from the input integers.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`p[:3]`**: This slices the first three elements of the list `p`.
2. **`map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])`**: This applies a lambda function to each element in the first three elements of `p`. The lambda function checks if the element is odd (`x % 2 > 0`). The result is a map object.
3. **`list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))`**: This converts the map object to a list of boolean values indicating whether each of the first three elements in `p` is odd.
4. **`sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])))`**: This sums the boolean values. Since `True` is treated as 1 and `False` as 0, this sum will be the count of odd numbers among the first three elements of `p`.
5. **`(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)`**: This checks if all three elements in the first three elements of `p` are odd. If they are, it returns `True` (which is 1), otherwise `False` (which is 0).
6. **`sum(p) // 2`**: This calculates the sum of all elements in `p` and then performs integer division by 2.
7. **`(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2`**: This adds the result of the boolean check (0 or 1) to the integer division result.

### Explanation:
- Since `p` is a list of the nearest even numbers derived from the input integers, all elements in `p` are even.
- Therefore, the first three elements of `p` are also even.
- The expression `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])))` will always be 0 because there are no odd numbers in the first three elements.
- The expression `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` will always be `False` (0).
- The expression `sum(p) // 2` will be the sum of all elements in `p` divided by 2.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the sum of all elements in `p` divided by 2, since the boolean check will always be 0.

Output: **sum(p) // 2 (where sum(p) is the sum of all elements in the list p)**
