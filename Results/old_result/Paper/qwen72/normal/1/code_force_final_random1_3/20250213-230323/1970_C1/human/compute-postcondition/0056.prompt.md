Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *The loop has processed all reachable nodes from `start` until either the `target` node is found or all possible nodes are visited. The `visited` set contains all nodes that have been visited during the traversal, starting from `start`. If the `target` node was reached, the program returns the distance (`dist`) which represents the shortest path from `start` to `target`. If the `target` node was not found, the program returns the distance to the last node processed from the `queue`.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor, `neighbor` is the first neighbor in `tree[current]`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `neighbor` is added to `visited`, and `queue` contains a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` at the end.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`tree[current]` must contain at least two neighbors, and `neighbor` is the second neighbor in `tree[current]`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `neighbor` is added to `visited`, and `queue` now contains a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` at the end. If `neighbor` is already in `visited`, no changes are made to `visited` or `queue`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tree[current]` must contain at least three neighbors, and `neighbor` is the third neighbor in `tree[current]`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `neighbor` is added to the set `visited`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. Otherwise, `neighbor` remains unchanged and is not added to `visited` or `queue`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
