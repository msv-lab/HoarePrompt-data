Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is 1. If the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is less than the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`, then `d2[n - 2]` is 2. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + 1`.***
