To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object in the loop head, which is the variable `_`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n.
- It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The loop will execute if the input value (which should be `t`) is greater than 0. Since `t` is already defined as being between 1 and 10^4, the loop will always execute at least once.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value is within the valid range for `t`.

State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the input value is equal to `t`**
