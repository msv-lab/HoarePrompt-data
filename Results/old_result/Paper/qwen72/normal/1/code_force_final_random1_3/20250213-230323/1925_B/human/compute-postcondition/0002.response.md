The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them by a space, and assigns them to `x` and `n` respectively. The values of `x` and `n` are updated based on the input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `q` is 0, and the input value must be greater than 0**.
