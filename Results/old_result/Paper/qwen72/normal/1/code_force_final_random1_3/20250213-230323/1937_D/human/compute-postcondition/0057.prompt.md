Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s`. The list `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters. The list `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`. `B` is an empty list. `idx_B` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(0, n):
    i = n - 1 - j
    if s[i] == '<':
        if len(idx_B) == 0:
            B.append(0)
        else:
            x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
            B.append(x)
        idx_B.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `i` is `n - 1`. If the character at position `i` in `s` is '<', `idx_B` is now `[n - 1]`. If `len(idx_B)` was 0, `B` is a list containing `[0]` and `idx_B` is now `[n - 1]`. Otherwise, `B` is updated to `[B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)]`, and `idx_B` is now `[n - 1]`. If the character at position `i` in `s` is not '<', the lists `B` and `idx_B` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `i` is `n - 2`. If `s[i]` is '<', `idx_B` now includes the value `n - 2`, `B` now includes the value `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2)) * len(idx_B)` if `len(idx_B) > 0`, otherwise `B` now contains one additional element which is 0, and `x` is set to this new value in `B`. If `s[i]` is not '<', `B` and `idx_B` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `i` is `n - 3`, `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged, `x` remains unchanged. If `s[i]` is '<', `idx_B` now includes the value `n - 3`, `B` now includes the value `x` which is \( B_{\text{last}} + (idx_B_{\text{last}} - (n - 3)) \times len(idx_B) \), and `x` is \( B_{\text{last}} + (idx_B_{\text{last}} - (n - 3)) \times len(idx_B) \).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
