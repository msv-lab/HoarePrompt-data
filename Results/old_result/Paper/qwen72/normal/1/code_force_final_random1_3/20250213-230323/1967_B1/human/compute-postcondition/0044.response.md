Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the new input integers, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2) - 1`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
