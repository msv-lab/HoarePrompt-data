Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list `cas_de_test` containing `t` tuples, each with three integers (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of three players in a game. The function processes each tuple to determine the number of ties or if the game is invalid. It returns a list `resultats` of length `t`, where each element is either the number of ties divided by 2 or -1. Specifically, for each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)`, if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are odd, or if the total matches (`total_points // 2`) is greater than 3, or if `p3` is greater than the total matches, or if the number of ties (`egalites`) is negative, then `-1` is appended to `resultats`. Otherwise, the number of ties (`egalites // 2`) is appended. The original list `cas_de_test` remains unchanged. **
