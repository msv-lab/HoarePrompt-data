The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is `n_input`. For the loop to execute the first time, `n_input` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `n_input` and `n_input` must be greater than 0, `k` is `k_input`, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` (which is 0), `pow` is \(2^{\text{length of } L}\) (which is \(2^0 = 1\)), `a` is undefined because `L` is empty.**
