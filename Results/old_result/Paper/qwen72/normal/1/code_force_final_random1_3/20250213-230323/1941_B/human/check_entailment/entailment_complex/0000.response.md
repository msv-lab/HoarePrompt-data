Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it's possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation involves decrementing three consecutive elements in the array by specific amounts. However, the provided solution only checks the parity (odd/even nature) of the first and last elements and their immediate neighbors. This approach is insufficient because it does not consider the overall feasibility of making all elements zero through the allowed operations.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the sum of the elements in the array is even and that the array can be transformed into an array of zeros by repeatedly applying the operation. The key insight is that each operation decreases the sum of the array by 4, so the sum of the array must be a multiple of 4 for the transformation to be possible.

Additionally, the operation can only be applied to indices \(2 \le i \le n-1\), which means the first and last elements cannot be directly modified by the operation. Therefore, the first and last elements must be zero or able to be reduced to zero without affecting the rest of the array.

Given the current implementation:
- It only checks the parity of the first and last elements and their immediate neighbors.
- It does not verify if the sum of the array is a multiple of 4.
- It does not consider the feasibility of reducing the entire array to zero.

Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
