To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input
- `idx` is 5
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and is greater than or equal to 2
- `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`
- Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `q` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5
- The array `a` contains `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0 except `a[1]` which is `int(data[3])` and `a[2]` which is `int(data[4])`
- Each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n
- The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5
- `results` is an empty list
- `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros
- `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is `int(data[3])` and the value is a list containing `[1]`
- `i` is 2
- `pf[1]` is `int(data[3])`
- `pf[2]` is `pf[1] ^ a[2]`
- `mp[pf[2]]` is a list containing `[2]`

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
- `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is 5, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and is greater than or equal to 2, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, each test case consists of two integers `n` and `q` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, the array `a` contains `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0 except `a[1]` which is `int(data[3])` and `a[2]` which is `int(data[4])`, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, the sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `results` is an empty list, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is `int(data[3])` and the value is a list containing `[1]`, `i` is 3, `pf[1]` is `int(data[3])`, `pf[2]` is `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `mp[pf[2]]` is a list containing `[2]`**
