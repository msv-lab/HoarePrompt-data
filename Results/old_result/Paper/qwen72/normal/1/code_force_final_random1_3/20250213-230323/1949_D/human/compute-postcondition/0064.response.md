The code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the list `a` by 1. Given that `i` is 3, the value at index 3 of `a` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 3, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the string `x`, and the new input string `x`, `a[3]` is incremented by 1, `b` is not affected, and the character at position `j - 1` in the string `x` is 'F'.**
