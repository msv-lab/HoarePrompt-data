Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `current_year` is 0, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `results` now includes `current_year` as its last element, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test`, `test_cases`, `test`, and `results` remain unchanged except for the changes mentioned above.
Code of the loop:
for ai in a:
    if current_year % ai == 0:
        next_year = current_year + ai
    else:
        next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
    current_year = next_year


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `current_year` is set to `next_year`, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `results` now includes the previous `current_year` as its last element, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and must be an iterable with at least one element, `test_cases`, `test`, and `results` remain unchanged except for the changes mentioned above, `ai` is the first element of `a`. If the previous `current_year` was divisible by `ai`, `next_year` was set to `ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` was set to the smallest multiple of `ai` greater than the previous `current_year`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `results` now includes the previous `current_year` as its last element, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and must be an iterable with at least one more element, `ai` is the next element of `a`. If `current_year % ai == 0`, then `next_year` is `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`, `test_cases` has at least one more element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `results` includes the previous `current_year` as its last element, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and must be an iterable with at least one more element, `ai` is the next element of `a`. If `current_year % ai == 0`, then `next_year` is now `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is now equal to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
