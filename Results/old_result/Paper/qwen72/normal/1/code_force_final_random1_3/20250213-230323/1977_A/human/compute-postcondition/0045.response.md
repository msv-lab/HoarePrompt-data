Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. If both `n` and `m` are odd, the program takes no additional action. If either `n` or `m` is even, the program also takes no additional action.***
