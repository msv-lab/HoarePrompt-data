Output State: **`tc` is an input integer where 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `dp` is True.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to be the length of `arr` minus 1. Since `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, the length of `arr` is the number of unique integers plus one (for the 0). Therefore, `n` is the number of unique integers in `arr`.
- All other variables (`tc`, `t`, `arr`, and `dp`) remain unchanged.
