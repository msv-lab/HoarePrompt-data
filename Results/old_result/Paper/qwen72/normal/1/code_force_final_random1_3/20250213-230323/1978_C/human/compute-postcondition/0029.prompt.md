Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is now `k // 2`, `l` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, -1, -2):
    c += 1
    if k == 0:
        return l
    if k < i - 1:
        return func_2(c, k, l)
    k = k - i + 1
    l = func_3(c, l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)
   - `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is now `k // 2 - i + 1`
   - `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)`
   - `c` is 1
   - `i` is `n`
   - `k` is not equal to 0, and `k` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is now `k - (n - 2) + 1`, `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`, `i` is `n - 2`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `(n - 2) - 1`. If `k` is 0, the program returns the result of `func_3(2, l)` where `l` is the initial value of `l`. If `k` is less than `i - 1`, the program returns the result of `func_2(2, k, l)` where `k` is `k // 2 - (n - 2) + 1`, and `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)` with `l` being the initial value of `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is now `k - (n - 2) + 1 - (n - 4) + 1`, `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)`, `i` is `n - 4`, `k` is greater than or equal to `(n - 2) - 1`, and `c` is increased by 1. If `k` is 0, the program returns the result of `func_3(c, l)`. If `k` is less than `i - 1`, the program returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`, where `c` is the value of `c` increased by 1, `k` is the value of `k` after being updated to `k - (n - 2) + 1` and is greater than or equal to `(n - 2) - 1`, and `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)`. Otherwise, the program does not return anything explicitly.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
