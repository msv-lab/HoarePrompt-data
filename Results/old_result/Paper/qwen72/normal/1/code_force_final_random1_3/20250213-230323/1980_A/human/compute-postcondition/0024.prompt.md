Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `missing`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string consisting of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `freq` is a list of 7 zeros, `missing` is the sum of the differences between `m` and each frequency in `freq` where the frequency is less than `m`.
Code of the loop:
for prob in a:
    freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `missing`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string consisting of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G' and must have at least one character, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is 1 and the rest are 0, `missing` is the sum of the differences between `m` and each frequency in `freq` where the frequency is less than `m`, `prob` is the first character in the string `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `missing`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string consisting of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G' and must have at least two characters, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is now 2 and the rest are 0, `missing` is the sum of the differences between `m` and each frequency in `freq` where the frequency is less than `m`, `prob` is the second character in the string `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `missing`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string consisting of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G' and must have at least three characters, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is 3 and the rest are 0, `missing` is the sum of the differences between `m` and each frequency in `freq` where the frequency is less than `m`, `prob` is the third character in the string `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
