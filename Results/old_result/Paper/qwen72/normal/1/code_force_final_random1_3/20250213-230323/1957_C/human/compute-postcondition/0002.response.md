To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(3, n + 1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the range `range(3, n + 1)` contains at least one value. This means that `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to run at least once.
3. **Initial State of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to the starting value of the range, which is 3.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute.
- `i` should be 3 at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer representing the size of the chessboard, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5.
- `dp[1]` is 1.
- `dp[2]` is 3.

We need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 and `i` is 3.

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3**
