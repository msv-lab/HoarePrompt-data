The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of times it will process a time string `s` in the format "hh:mm". For each `s`, it converts the time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and appends 'AM' or 'PM' accordingly, printing the result directly. After processing all inputs, the function completes without returning any value, leaving the input variables `t` and `s` unchanged.
