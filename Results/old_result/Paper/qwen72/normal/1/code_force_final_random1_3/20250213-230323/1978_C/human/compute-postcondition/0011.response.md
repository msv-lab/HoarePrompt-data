Functionality: ** The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of integers representing a permutation of length `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` in the order they appear, separated by spaces. After printing all elements, it prints a newline character. The function does not return any value. **
