Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

### Initial State:
- If `s[i]` is '0':
  - `i` is 2
  - `n` is an input integer greater than 2
  - `one_perc` is 0
  - `zero` is 3
  - `zero_perc` is 100
  - `one` is 0
  - `lst` is [1]
- If `s[i]` is not '0':
  - `i` is 2
  - `n` is an input integer greater than 2
  - `one_perc` is 0
  - `zero` is 1
  - `zero_perc` is 33
  - `one` is 2
  - `lst` is [1, 2] if `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, otherwise `lst` remains [1]

### Code Snippet:
```python
one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `o` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume it is a typo and should be `one`.
- The expression `(o - one)` simplifies to `(one - one)`, which is 0.
- The denominator `(n - i - 1)` simplifies to `(n - 2 - 1)`, which is `(n - 3)`.

### Calculation:
- `one_perc = (0) * 100 // (n - 3)`
- `one_perc = 0 // (n - 3)`
- Since `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `(n - 3)` is a positive integer.
- Therefore, `one_perc` remains 0.

### Output State:
- The value of `one_perc` is updated to 0.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `one_perc` is 0, `zero` is 3 if `s[i]` is '0' or 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', `zero_perc` is 100 if `s[i]` is '0' or 33 if `s[i]` is not '0', `one` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0' or 2 if `s[i]` is not '0', `lst` is [1] if `s[i]` is '0' or [1, 2] if `s[i]` is not '0' and `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, otherwise `lst` remains [1].**
