Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `array2` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
        array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, and `array2` is either an empty list or a list containing the value `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. If the difference between the second element of `arr` and the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, and `array2` is either an empty list or a list containing the value `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`. If the difference between the third element of `arr` and the second element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers input by the user where `n` is the first element, `f` is the second element, `a` is the third element, and `b` is the last element. `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. If the difference between the fourth element of `arr` and the third element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a` and now also contains the value `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains either an empty list or a list containing the value `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
