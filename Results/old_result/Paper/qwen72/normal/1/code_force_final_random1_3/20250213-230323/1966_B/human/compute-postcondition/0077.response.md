The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the condition `i < n - 1` to hold true.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is 1, `j` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` remains `True` if no changes were made in the loop body that would affect its value.**
