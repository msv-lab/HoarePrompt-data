The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. Since the initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are updated to the positive integers provided by the input, and `int(input())` must be greater than 1, the values of `a` and `b` will be the two positive integers entered by the user.

The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` and `b` are updated to the positive integers provided by the input, `i` is 2.**
