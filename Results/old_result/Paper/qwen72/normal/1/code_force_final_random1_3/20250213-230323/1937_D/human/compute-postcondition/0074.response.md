Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
   - `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
   - `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
   - `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
   - `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
   - `j` is `n`.
   - `i` is `0`.
   - `l` is `0`.
   - `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`.
   - The character at position `i` in `s` is '>'.
   - `l` is greater than or equal to `r`.
   - `r` is 0, meaning there are no '<' characters in the string `s`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(n - i, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `i` is `0`.
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - Since `i` is `0`, `n - i` is simply `n`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The print statement will output the length of the string `s`.

Output: **n (where n is the length of the string s)**
