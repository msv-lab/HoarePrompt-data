The code snippet sorts the `balance_info` list based on two criteria: first, by the `balance` attribute of each `BalanceInfo` object in ascending order, and second, by the negative of the `position` attribute in descending order (which effectively sorts by `position` in ascending order when combined with the primary sort key).

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string of balanced parentheses with a length not exceeding 500,000.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `balance_info` is a list of `n` `BalanceInfo` objects, each representing the balance, index, and character at each position in `s`.

After sorting:
- The `balance_info` list will be sorted such that objects with lower `balance` values come first. Within the same `balance` value, objects with lower `position` values come first.
- The `s` string, `n` length, and the fact that `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is now sorted by the `balance` attribute in ascending order, and within the same `balance`, by the `position` attribute in ascending order.**
