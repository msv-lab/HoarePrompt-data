Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 3 elements, `j` is 2, and `test` is True. The state of the variables remains unchanged regardless of whether `j` is odd or even.***
