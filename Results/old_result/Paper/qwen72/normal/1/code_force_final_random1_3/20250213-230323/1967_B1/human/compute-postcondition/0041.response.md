Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are updated to the new input integers, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
