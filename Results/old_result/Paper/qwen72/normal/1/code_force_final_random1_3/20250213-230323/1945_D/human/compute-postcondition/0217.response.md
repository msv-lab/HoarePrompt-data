Output State: **`custos` is a list containing `x` elements, where `x` is the number of test cases. Each element in `custos` represents the total cost calculated for each test case.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the list `custos` will contain exactly `x` elements, where `x` is the number of test cases. Each element in the list `custos` corresponds to the total cost calculated for each respective test case. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial values, as specified in the initial state. The variables `i`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, and `b` are re-initialized at the start of each iteration and do not retain any specific values from the last iteration. The variable `custo` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration and holds the final cost for the current test case before being appended to `custos`.
