The code snippet `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to its original value, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1, if `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, `cnt_b`, `curr`, and `ans` remain unchanged, `cnt_b[a[2 + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is increased by 1.**
