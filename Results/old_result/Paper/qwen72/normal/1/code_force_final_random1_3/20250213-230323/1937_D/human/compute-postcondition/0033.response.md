Postcondition: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `i` is `n - 1`, the character at position `i` in `s` is '<', and the length of `idx_B` is 0.**
