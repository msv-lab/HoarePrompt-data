Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `5 + n + 2 * q + n + 3`, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[i]` is set to `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to index `i`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional element at the end which is now 'YES', `i` is `n`, `l` is `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + n + 1])`, `r` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[r]`, `v2` is the list of indices from `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[l - 1]`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `it2` is the index in `v2` where `r` would be inserted to maintain sorted order minus 1.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the string 'YES' to the list `results`.
- All other variables (`t`, `data`, `idx`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`) remain unchanged.
- The new state of `results` includes all its previous elements plus the newly appended 'YES'.
