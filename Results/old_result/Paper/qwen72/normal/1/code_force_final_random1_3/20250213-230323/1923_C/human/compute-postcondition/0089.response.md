To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are input integers with `m` being greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are new input integers.
- `i` is defined as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is defined as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
- `l` is a list of integers from the input.
- `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative sums of elements in `l`.
- `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative counts of 1s in `l`.
- `j` is the total count of 1s in the list `l`.

### Explanation:
- The `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or lists mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**

This is because the `print` statement is explicitly printing the string `'YES'`, regardless of the values of the other variables or the state of the program.
