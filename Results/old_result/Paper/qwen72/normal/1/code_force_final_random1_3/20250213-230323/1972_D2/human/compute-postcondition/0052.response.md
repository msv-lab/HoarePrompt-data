Output State: **`x` is 4, `y` is 4, `n` is at least 28, `m` is at least 21, and `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing from 3 to 4.
- The values of `x`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- The condition for calculating `cnt` remains the same, but now it applies to the updated value of `y` (which is 4).
