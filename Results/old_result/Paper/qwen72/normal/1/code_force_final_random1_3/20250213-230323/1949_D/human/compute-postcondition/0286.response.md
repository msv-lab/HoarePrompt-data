Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged, `i` is `n + 1`, and `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'F'.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `nx += 'F'` updates the value of `nx` by appending the character 'F' to its current value.
- All other variables (`j`, `n`, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The initial state specifies that `j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, and `sb` remain unchanged, and `i` is `n + 1`.
- The value of `nx` is updated to include the additional character 'F'.
