Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an even integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of columns in the grid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. The grid consists of two rows, each represented by a string of length n containing only the characters '<' and '>', indicating the direction of the arrows in each cell.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations without breaking early. `t` is 0, as all test cases have been processed. For each test case, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, and the loop has completed all iterations without breaking. The final value of `i` for each test case is `n-1` if `n` is odd, or `n-2` if `n` is even. The program prints 'yes' for each test case if it did not break out of the loop during any iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of columns in a grid, followed by two strings `a` and `b` of length `n`, each containing only the characters '<' and '>'. The function checks if there exists any pair of adjacent columns (i, i+1) such that either `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'`. If such a pair is found, the function prints 'No' and moves to the next test case. If no such pair is found for all columns, the function prints 'Yes'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that all test cases have been processed and the appropriate output ('Yes' or 'No') has been printed for each.
