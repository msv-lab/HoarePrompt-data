Output State: **`egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `(p1, p2, p3)` is the third tuple in the list, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3` of the third tuple, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2` of the third tuple, `resultats` is a list containing the value `egalites // 2` appended to its existing values. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, -1 is appended to `resultats`. If `egalites` is less than 0, an additional -1 is appended to `resultats`. If `total_points` is odd, an additional -1 is appended to `resultats`.**
