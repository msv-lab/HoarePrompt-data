Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`, and `pos` is not equal to `l`.**
