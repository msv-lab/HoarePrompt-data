The code snippet `goal[tmp].append((i, ind))` appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Given the initial conditions:

- `tmp` is 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `ind` is 0.
- `goal` is a list containing two lists.

The tuple `(2, 0)` will be appended to `goal[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing three elements: the original list `line`, the new list `line`, and the new list `line` again, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)` and an entry for each string `s` in the new `line` that is not '..' with the value `(1, index_of_s)`, `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is a new list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input and must have at least one element, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with entries for each string `s` in the new `line` that represents a player, with the value `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists where `goal[1]` now includes the tuple `(2, 0)`, `ind` is 0, `elements` now includes an additional entry for `line[0]` with the value `(2, 0)`, `line[ind]` is not a player, the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', and `tmp` is 1.**
