### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if a subarray `c[l...r]` is "good."
   - A subarray is "good" if there exists another array `b` of the same length such that:
     - The sum of elements in `c[l...r]` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
     - No element in `c[l...r]` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
     - All elements in `b` are positive.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For a subarray to be "good," it must contain at least one element that is not 1. This is because if all elements are 1, it's impossible to find a different positive integer for each element while maintaining the same sum.
   - If the subarray has at least one element greater than 1, we can always construct a valid `b` by decrementing the elements greater than 1 and incrementing the elements that are 1.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the array `l` and constructs two prefix arrays:
     - `p`: Prefix sum array to store the cumulative sum of elements.
     - `c`: Prefix count array to store the cumulative count of elements equal to 1.
   - For each query, it calculates:
     - The sum of the subarray `s = p[b] - p[a-1]`.
     - The count of 1s in the subarray `i = c[b] - c[a-1]`.
   - It checks if the subarray is "good" by verifying:
     - The length of the subarray is greater than 1.
     - The sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of 1s in the subarray.

4. **Verification:**
   - The condition `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures that the subarray has more than one element.
   - The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` ensures that the subarray has enough "slack" to adjust the elements to form a valid `b`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
