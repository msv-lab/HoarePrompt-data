The code snippet `n = int(data[idx])` updates the value of `n` by converting the string at the position `idx` in the list `data` to an integer.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input
- `idx` is `3 + n + 2 * q + n + 1 + 2 * q`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `q` is 0
- `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[i]` is set to `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n`
- `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to index `i`
- `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs
- `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional empty string at the end
- `i` is `n`

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[idx]`
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `3 + n + 2 * q + n + 1 + 2 * q`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `q` is 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[i]` is set to `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to index `i`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional empty string at the end, and `i` is `n`.**
