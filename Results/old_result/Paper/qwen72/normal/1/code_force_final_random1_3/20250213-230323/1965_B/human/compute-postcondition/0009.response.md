Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with new values assigned by `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `l` is the length of the binary string `b` and must be greater than 2. The current value of `k` is 1. `n` is not equal to 2. `ans` is `[2, 3, 4]`. `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(2 ** i)` appends the value of `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 2, `2 ** i` evaluates to `4`. Therefore, the list `ans` changes from `[2, 3]` to `[2, 3, 4]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
