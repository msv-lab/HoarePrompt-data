Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged, and `i` is `n + 1`. If the character at position `i` in the string `xx[0]` is not equal to '?', then `nx` is set to this character. Otherwise, if either `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, then `nx` is set to 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is set to 'F'.***
