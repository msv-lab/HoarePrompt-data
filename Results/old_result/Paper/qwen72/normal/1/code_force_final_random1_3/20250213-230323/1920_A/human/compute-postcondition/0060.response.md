The function `func_7` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it implicitly works with predefined values for `n`, `start`, `end`, and `num`. `n` is an integer constrained to the range 2 to 100, `start` is a floating-point number initialized to -1, `end` is a floating-point number initialized to 1000000000.0, and `num` is an initially empty list. The function evaluates two cases:

- **Case_1**: The function returns 0.
- **Case_2**: The function returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus `count_num` if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `end` represents the minimum value encountered when `t` was 2, `start` represents the maximum value encountered when `t` was 1, and `count_num` is the count of elements in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive).

Functionality: **The function evaluates the range between `start` and `end` and the count of elements in `num` within this range. It returns 0 if the range is less than the count of elements. Otherwise, it returns the adjusted difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus the count of elements in `num` within the range.**
