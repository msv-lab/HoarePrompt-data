Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input.
- `score` is the sum of every second element starting from the first element of `l` (i.e., `l[0] + l[2] + l[4] + ... + l[2*n-2]`).
- `i` is 2 * n - 2.
- The loop has completed all its iterations.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(score)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `l`**:
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers. The exact values of these integers are not specified, but they are sorted in ascending order.

2. **Understanding `score`**:
   - `score` is calculated as the sum of every second element starting from the first element of `l`.
   - This means `score = l[0] + l[2] + l[4] + ... + l[2*n-2]`.

3. **Understanding `i`**:
   - `i` is set to 2 * n - 2. This is the last index of the elements being summed in `score`.

4. **Loop Completion**:
   - The loop has completed all its iterations, so the calculation of `score` is complete.

### Final Output:
The `print(score)` statement will print the sum of every second element starting from the first element of the list `l`.

Since the exact values of the elements in `l` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `score`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated `score`.

Output: **score (where score is the sum of every second element starting from the first element of the list `l`)**
