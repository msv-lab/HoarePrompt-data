Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is now equal to the sum of every second element starting from the first element of `l` (i.e., `l[0] + l[2] + l[4] + ... + l[2*n-2]`), `i` is 2 * n - 2, and the loop has completed all its iterations.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))` updates the value of `l` to a sorted list of integers from the new input.
- The initial state specifies that `l` was already a sorted list of integers from an input, but the new input overwrites the previous value of `l`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `score`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The loop status remains the same as specified in the initial state.
