Postcondition: ***`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `l` (now `l + 1`), `m` (now 0), `i` (now 1), `s` (index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order), `ql` (decremented by `a[s - 1]`), `ql` is now an input integer. If `a[s] == ql`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement.***
