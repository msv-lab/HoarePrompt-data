To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a specific integer read from the input.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `m` is a specific integer read from the input.
   - `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of strings.
   - `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)` and an entry for each string `s` in any `line` that is not '..' with the value `(i, index_of_s)`.
   - `points` is a list of two integers where `points[team]` is increased by 10.
   - `allPlayers` is a dictionary with entries for each string `s` in any `line` that represents a player, with the value `False`.
   - `goal` is a list containing two lists. For each string `s` in any `line` that is not '..' and has a second character 'G', the tuple `(i, index_of_s)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`, where `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `s` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `time` is 0.
   - `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, and the length of `command` is 3.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `el` is the third element of `command`, and `el` is equal to `.S`.
   - `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `time` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `team` is determined based on the first character of `obj`. Since `obj` is the first element of `command`, and `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, `obj` could be any string. However, the problem states that `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.
   - `GoalName` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is assumed to be a dictionary that maps team numbers (0 or 1) to their respective names. For example, `GoalName` might look like `{0: 'Team A', 1: 'Team B'}`.

4. **Determine the Output:**
   - If the first character of `obj` is 'B', then `team` is 1.
   - If the first character of `obj` is not 'B', then `team` is 0.
   - The `print` statement will format the output as `'%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team])`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:

- If the first character of `obj` is 'B':
  - `team` is 1.
  - The output will be `0 Team B CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH` (assuming `GoalName[1]` is 'Team B').

- If the first character of `obj` is not 'B':
  - `team` is 0.
  - The output will be `0 Team A CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH` (assuming `GoalName[0]` is 'Team A').

Since the exact value of `GoalName` is not provided, we will use the most precise description possible based on the given information.

Output: **0 [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where [GoalName[team]] is the name of the team based on the first character of `obj`)**
