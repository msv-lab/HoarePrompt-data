Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the MEX value for the array `c` after simulating the game between Alice and Bob. The logic in `func_1` function effectively simulates the optimal moves of Alice and Bob, ensuring that Alice maximizes the MEX value and Bob minimizes it. The use of a counter (`nums`) to track the frequency of elements and a set (`vis`) to track visited numbers helps in efficiently determining the MEX value. The solution handles the constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem statement.
