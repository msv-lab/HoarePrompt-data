Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` is the total number of elements in `num`, `i` is the last element in `num`, `start` remains the maximum value encountered when `t` was 1, `end` remains the minimum value encountered when `t` was 2, `num` contains all values of `v` encountered when `t` was 3, and `count_num` is the count of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive).**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `n` is the total number of elements in the list `num`.
- The variable `i` is the last element processed from the list `num`.
- The variables `start` and `end` remain unchanged from their initial values, which were set based on conditions outside the loop.
- The list `num` remains the same as it was initially, containing all values of `v` encountered when `t` was 3.
- The variable `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive). If an element in `num` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, it is skipped, and `count_num` is not incremented for that element.
