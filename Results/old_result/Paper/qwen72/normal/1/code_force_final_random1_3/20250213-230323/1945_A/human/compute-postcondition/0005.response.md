The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, s.split())` reads the next line from the input file (which is stored in `s`) and splits it into three parts, converting each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a non-negative integer
- `b` is now `b + c`
- `c` is a non-negative integer
- 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9
- `s` is the next line in the input file (starting from the second line)

After executing the code snippet:
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are reassigned to the values read from the input line `s`.
- The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are no longer relevant.
- The condition 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9 still holds true for the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers read from the next line in the input file, and 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9.**
