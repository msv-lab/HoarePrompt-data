To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

- The loop condition is `pos != len(sorted_indices)`.
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
  - `rest` is `0` or `pos` is equal to the length of `sorted_indices`.
  - `pos` is an index less than the length of `sorted_indices` or equal to the length of `sorted_indices`.
  - `distance` is `distance + 1`.
  - Other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) retain their initial values.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `pos != len(sorted_indices)` must be true. This means `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`.

Given that `pos` is an index less than the length of `sorted_indices` or equal to the length of `sorted_indices`, we need to ensure that `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`.

Since the other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, `distance`, `rest`) do not affect the loop condition directly, they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`rest` is `0` or `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`, `distance` is `distance + 1`, all other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) retain their initial values.**
