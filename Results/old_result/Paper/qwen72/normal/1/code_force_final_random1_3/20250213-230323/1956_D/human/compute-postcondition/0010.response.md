Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is provided by the input and satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7, `s` is the first value returned by `func_2(a)`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2(a)`, and `ops` is an empty list of pairs returned by `func_2(a)`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the list `ops`, which contains pairs of indices `(l, r)`.
- Each iteration of the loop prints the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`.
- After all iterations, the list `ops` will be empty because the loop has processed all pairs in `ops`.
- The other variables (`n`, `a`, `s`, and `m`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
