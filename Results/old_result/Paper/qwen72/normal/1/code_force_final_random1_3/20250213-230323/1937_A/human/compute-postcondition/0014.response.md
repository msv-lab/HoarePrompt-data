Output State: **`i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to `power - 1`, `power` is `n + 1`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `power` is less than `n`.
- Each iteration of the loop increments `power` by 1.
- The loop will stop when `power` is no longer less than `n`, which means `power` will be equal to `n` at the end of the last iteration.
- Therefore, after the loop finishes, `power` will be `n + 1` because it will have been incremented one last time to exit the loop.
- The condition `n` must be greater than or equal to `power - 1` ensures that the loop has executed enough times to reach the final value of `power`.

So, the final state is:
- `i` remains 0.
- `n_cases` remains greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `power - 1`.
- `power` is `n + 1`.
