Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `n_input - ((n_input + 1) // 2) - m`, `k` is `k_input`, `L` is `[m]`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `a` is undefined because `L` is now `[m]`, `m` is `((n_input - ((n_input + 1) // 2)) + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `m` from its current value.
- The new value of `n` is `n_input - ((n_input + 1) // 2) - m`.
- All other variables (`t`, `k`, `L`, `tot`, `pow`, `a`, `m`) remain unchanged.
