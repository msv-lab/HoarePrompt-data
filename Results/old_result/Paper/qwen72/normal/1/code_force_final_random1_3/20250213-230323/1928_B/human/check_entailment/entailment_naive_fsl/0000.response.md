Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem described. The problem requires determining the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array. However, the provided functions do not perform this task. They seem to be utility functions for reading input and performing some operations, but none of them address the core logic needed to solve the problem.

For example, the functions `func_1` to `func_7` are for reading input in different formats, and `func_8` and `func_9` are for computing the product of elements in an array, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

A correct solution would involve:
1. Reading the input for multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, calculating the frequency of each possible sum after adding a permutation.
3. Determining the maximum frequency of any sum.

Since the provided code does not implement this logic, it is incorrect.
