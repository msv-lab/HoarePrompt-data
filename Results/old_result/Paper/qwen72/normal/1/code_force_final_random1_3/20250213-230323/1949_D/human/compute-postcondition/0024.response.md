The code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a` by 1. However, the initial state does not specify the values of `a` or `i`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new value of `a[i]` without knowing these details. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3, `a[i]` is incremented by 1.**
