The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. 

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: 
  - The first element is a tuple `(n, m)` with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 and `m` being a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 5.
  - The second element is a string `a` consisting of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'.

The function returns a list `results` containing `t` values of `missing`. Each `missing` value corresponds to the result of processing one tuple from `test_cases`. Each `missing` value represents the sum of the differences between `m` and the frequency of each character from 'A' to 'G' in the string `a`, where the frequency is less than `m`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. For each tuple in `test_cases`, it calculates the sum of the differences between `m` and the frequency of each character from 'A' to 'G' in the string `a`, where the frequency is less than `m`. It returns a list `results` containing these calculated values for each test case.**
