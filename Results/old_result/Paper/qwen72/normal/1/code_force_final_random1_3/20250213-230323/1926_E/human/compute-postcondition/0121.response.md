Output State: **For each test case, if `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), the final output state after all iterations of the loop will be: `s` is the sum of the series \((d + 1) // 2\) until `s` is no longer less than `k` or `d` becomes 0, `i` is the total number of iterations, `d` is 0 or a value such that adding \((d + 1) // 2\) to `s` would make `s` exceed or equal `k`, `h` is 0, `p` is equal to `i`, `g` is the sum of \((h + 1) // 2\) for each iteration, `f` is equal to `k - g`, and `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times f - 1)\). If `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\), the final output state will be: `y` is \(2 \times k - 1\). The variables `n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g` will be reset to their initial values for each new test case.**

Explanation:
- For each test case, the loop processes the values of `n` and `k`.
- If `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), the loop calculates `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, and `f` as described, and outputs `y` as \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times f - 1)\).
- If `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\), the loop directly outputs `y` as \(2 \times k - 1\).
- After processing each test case, the variables are reset to their initial values for the next test case.
