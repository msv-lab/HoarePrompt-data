To determine what will be printed by the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is a new input integer (greater than or equal to 3).
- `l` is a new list of integers from the latest user input.
- `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0.
- `d1[2]` is 1.
- `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on conditions inside the loop for each iteration.
- `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0.
- `d2[n - 1]` is 1.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the last user input.
- `x` is an integer.
- `y` is an integer, and `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

### Analysis:
- `d2` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0.
- `d2[n - 1]` is explicitly set to 1, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3.
- The `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement will print the difference between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`.

### Values of `d2`:
- `d2[n - 1]` is 1.
- For any other key in `d2`, the value will be 0 (since it is a defaultdict with a default value of 0).

### Possible Scenarios:
1. If `y == n - 1` and `x != n - 1`, then `d2[y]` will be 1 and `d2[x]` will be 0.
   - Therefore, `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be \(1 - 0 = 1\).
2. If `y != n - 1` and `x == n - 1`, then `d2[y]` will be 0 and `d2[x]` will be 1.
   - Therefore, `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be \(0 - 1 = -1\).
3. If both `y` and `x` are not equal to `n - 1`, then both `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` will be 0.
   - Therefore, `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be \(0 - 0 = 0\).

### Conclusion:
Given the conditions and the initial state, the output of the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement will depend on the values of `y` and `x` relative to `n - 1`.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[n - 1] is 1 and all other keys in d2 are 0)**

This means:
- If `y == n - 1` and `x != n - 1`, the output will be **1**.
- If `y != n - 1` and `x == n - 1`, the output will be **-1**.
- If both `y` and `x` are not equal to `n - 1`, the output will be **0**.
