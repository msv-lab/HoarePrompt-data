Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the length of a permutation list, and `k` is a non-negative integer. The function modifies a list `l` initialized as a sequence from 1 to `n`. It repositions the last element of `l` based on the value of `k` and the current state of the list. The function returns the modified list `l` under the following conditions: if `k` becomes 0 at any point, the list `l` is returned; if `1 + i` is greater than `k`, the last element `x` is moved to the position `-k` from the end of the list; otherwise, the last element `x` is moved to the beginning of the list. The final state of the list `l` reflects these modifications, and `k` is reduced during the process. **
