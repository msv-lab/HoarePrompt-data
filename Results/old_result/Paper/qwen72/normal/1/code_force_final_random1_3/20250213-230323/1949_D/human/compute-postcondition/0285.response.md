The code snippet `nx += 'S'` updates the value of `nx` by appending the character 'S' to its current value. Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `nx`, we assume it is a string. The other variables (`j`, `n`, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged, `i` is `n + 1`, and `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'S'.**
