Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to check if it correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the requirements and the program step by step:

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input**: Multiple test cases, each with two integers \( n \) and \( m \) where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \).
2. **Output**: For each test case, print the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
   - \( 1 \leq a \leq n \)
   - \( 1 \leq b \leq m \)
   - \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \)

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( m \).

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `count` is initialized to 2.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to \( n \).

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop runs while `count` is less than or equal to \( m \).
   - Inside the loop:
     - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
     - `g` is calculated as \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{\text{count}} \right\rfloor \).
     - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
     - `ans` is updated by adding \( \left\lfloor \frac{g}{\text{count}} \right\rfloor + 1 \).
     - `count` is incremented by 1.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the program prints the value of `ans`.

### Issues and Verification:
- **Initialization of `ans`**:
  - The initialization of `ans` to \( n \) seems to be an assumption that all pairs \((a, 1)\) are valid, which is not necessarily true. This needs to be verified.
  
- **Loop Logic**:
  - The loop logic is complex and involves several steps. It is not immediately clear why `count` starts at 2 and how the adjustments to `g` and `ans` are derived.
  - The condition `if g < countmins` is used to break the loop, but it is not clear why this condition ensures the correctness of the solution.

- **Validation with Examples**:
  - For the test case \( n = 1 \) and \( m = 1 \), the expected output is 1, which is correct.
  - For the test case \( n = 2 \) and \( m = 3 \), the expected output is 3. The program should correctly count the pairs \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity of the loop and the lack of clear explanation for the logic, it is difficult to definitively state that the program is correct without further validation. However, based on the provided test cases and the structure of the program, it appears to be attempting to solve the problem correctly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The program has some logical issues and assumptions that need to be clarified and validated. The initialization of `ans` and the loop logic need to be re-evaluated to ensure they correctly implement the problem requirements.
