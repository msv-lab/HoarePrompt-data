Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur` is 1 << (`ord(s[0]) - 97`), `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - 97`.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is updated by adding `1 << cur_ss` to its previous value, which was 0. The value of `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus 97. All other variables remain unchanged.
