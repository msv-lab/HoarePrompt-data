Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either from the beginning or the end of `a` based on the corresponding character in `s`, `l` is `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', or some value between 0 and `n` depending on the number of 'L's in `s`, `r` is -1 if all characters in `s` are 'R', or some value between -1 and `n - 1` depending on the number of 'R's in `s`, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is a list containing three elements, the first two of which are the value of `p`, and the third element is `(p * b[n-1]) % m`, `p` is now `(p * b[n-1]) % m`, `v` is `b[n-1]`.**
