### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads `n` lines of input, each representing a row of the grid.
   - It appends the count of '1's in each row to the list `k` if the row contains at least one '1'.

2. **Shape Determination:**
   - After collecting the counts of '1's in each row, the function checks the first two elements of the list `k`.
   - If the first two elements are equal (`k[0] == k[1]`), it prints "SQUARE".
   - Otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

### Analysis:

- **Triangle Check:**
  - A triangle is defined by having an increasing or decreasing number of '1's in each row, forming a pattern like `1, 3, 5, ...` or `5, 3, 1`.
  - The function does not explicitly check for this pattern but relies on the fact that the first two rows should have different counts of '1's if it is a triangle.

- **Square Check:**
  - A square is defined by having the same number of '1's in each row.
  - The function correctly identifies a square if the first two rows have the same count of '1's.

### Potential Issues:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function assumes that the grid contains exactly one shape (either a triangle or a square) and that the shape is correctly formed.
  - It does not handle cases where the grid might be empty or contain invalid shapes, but the problem statement guarantees that the grid will contain exactly one valid shape.

- **Generalization:**
  - The function only checks the first two rows to determine the shape. This works for the given constraints but might fail if the shape is more complex or if the grid size is larger.

### Conclusion:

Given the constraints and the problem statement, the function appears to correctly identify the shape based on the first two rows. Therefore, the program is correct for the given problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
