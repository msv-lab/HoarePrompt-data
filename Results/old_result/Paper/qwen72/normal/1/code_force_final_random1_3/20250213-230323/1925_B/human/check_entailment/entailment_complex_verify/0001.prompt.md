You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import sqrt

def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, x is an integer where 1 <= x <= 10^8, and n is an integer where 1 <= n <= x.
def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        x, n = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //
                    i) == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer from the last input, `n` is the second integer from the last input, `q` is `t - 1`, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, and `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` such that `x - n * d` is non-negative and divisible by `d`, where `d` is a divisor of `x` and `d` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`. If no such divisor exists, `ans` remains 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`. It then calculates the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `x - n * d` is non-negative and divisible by `d`. If no such divisor exists, it defaults to 1. The function prints this value for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the values of `t`, `x`, and `n` from the last test case, with `t` being the total number of test cases processed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums up to `x`.
   - The GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties should be maximized.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The function iterates over all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`. This is efficient because any divisor larger than the square root will have a corresponding divisor smaller than the square root.
   - For each divisor `i` of `x`, it checks if `i` can be the GCD of the sub-problems:
     - It checks if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`. If so, `i` is a valid GCD.
     - It also checks the corresponding divisor `x // i` to see if it can be the GCD.
   - The maximum valid GCD found during these checks is stored in `ans`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is less than `n`, which would result in a GCD of 1.
   - The program also handles the case where `x` is exactly divisible by `n`, which would result in the GCD being `x // n`.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The loop runs up to the square root of `x`, making the time complexity \(O(\sqrt{x})\), which is efficient for the given constraints.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly identifies the maximum GCD for the given examples:
     - For `x = 10` and `n = 3`, the maximum GCD is 2.
     - For `x = 5` and `n = 5`, the maximum GCD is 1.
     - For `x = 420` and `n = 69`, the maximum GCD is 6.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
