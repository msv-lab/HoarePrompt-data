Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider scenarios where the grid can be made uniform through valid operations but does not meet the specific conditions checked in the program. 

For example, consider the following grid:
```
3 3
WBB
BWB
BBW
```
In this case, the grid can be made entirely black by selecting the corners (1,1) and (3,3), which are both black, and coloring the entire subrectangle between them black. However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it checks only the top-left and bottom-right corners and the edges for uniformity, which is insufficient to determine the possibility of making the entire grid uniform.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not account for all valid transformations that could lead to a uniform grid.
