Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `a` is a non-negative integer.
- `b` is now `b + c` (where `b` and `c` are both non-negative integers).
- `c` is a non-negative integer.
- The constraints are: \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\).

### Print Statement:
```python
print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `b % 3`: This computes the remainder when `b` is divided by 3. The result will be one of the values: 0, 1, or 2.
   - `c < b % 3`: This is a boolean expression that checks if `c` is less than the remainder of `b` divided by 3. It will evaluate to `True` or `False`.
   - `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`: This is a tuple with two elements: `a - -b // 3` and `-1`. The expression `c < b % 3` is used as an index to select one of these elements. If `c < b % 3` is `True`, it will select the first element (`a - -b // 3`). If `c < b % 3` is `False`, it will select the second element (`-1`).

2. **Simplifying the Expression:**
   - `a - -b // 3`: The double negative `--b` simplifies to `b`. So, this expression becomes `a - b // 3`.
   - `b // 3`: This computes the integer division of `b` by 3, which is the largest integer less than or equal to `b / 3`.

3. **Final Expression:**
   - The final expression to be printed is either `a - b // 3` or `-1`, depending on whether `c < b % 3` is `True` or `False`.

### Output Determination:
- If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the output will be `a - b // 3`.
- If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the output will be `-1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **(a - b // 3) if c < b % 3 else -1 (where a, b, and c are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9)**
