Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `c` will be the number of iterations the loop has run, which is `(n + 1) // 2`. The value of `k` will be reduced by the sum of the series of odd numbers from `n` down to 1 (or 0 if `n` is even), and then incremented by the number of iterations. The list `l` will be the result of applying `func_3` to the initial list `n` times, once for each iteration. The loop will terminate when `i` becomes -1, and the final value of `i` will be -1. If `k` becomes 0 during the loop, the function will return the current state of `l`. If `k` becomes less than `i - 1` during the loop, the function will return the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `c` will count the number of times the loop has executed, which is `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The variable `k` will be updated by subtracting the sum of the series of odd numbers from `n` down to 1 (or 0 if `n` is even) and then adding the number of iterations.
- The list `l` will be transformed by applying the function `func_3` to it for each iteration of the loop.
- The loop will stop when `i` reaches -1, so the final value of `i` will be -1.
- If `k` becomes 0 at any point, the loop will return the current state of `l`.
- If `k` becomes less than `i - 1` at any point, the loop will return the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`.
