The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to 1000 and the second element set to 1000 + x[0], `i` is 2**
