Postcondition: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers derived from the user input and must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where `res[-1]` is now `mex - ar[-1]`, `mex` is `n`, `i` is -1, and the condition `(mex > mex - ar[i])` is true.** 

This means that all the initial conditions still hold, and additionally, the value of `mex` is greater than the value of `mex - ar[i]`. Since `i` is -1, this implies that `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[-1]`, which simplifies to `ar[-1]` being greater than 0.
