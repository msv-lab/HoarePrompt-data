The code snippet assigns the first three values from the input (split by spaces) to the elements at index `i` of the lists `x`, `y`, and `r`. Since `i` is 0, these assignments affect the first elements of the respective lists.

- `x[0]` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `y[0]` is assigned the second integer from the input.
- `r[0]` is assigned the third integer from the input.

The other variables and lists remain unchanged. The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` now have their first elements set to the integers provided by the input, while the rest of the elements in these lists and all elements in the `visited` and `coef` lists remain as they were initially.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, `x` is a list where `x[0]` is the first integer from the input and the rest are None, `y` is a list where `y[0]` is the second integer from the input and the rest are None, `r` is a list where `r[0]` is the third integer from the input and the rest are None, `visited` is a list of False values of length n, `coef` is a list of None values of length n.**
