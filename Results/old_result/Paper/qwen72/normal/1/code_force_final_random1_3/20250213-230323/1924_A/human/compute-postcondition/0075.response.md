Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string with at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur` is `1 << (ord(s[1]) - 97)`, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[1]) - 97`, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is updated by adding `1 << cur_ss` to its current value. Since `cur` was initially either 0 or remained unchanged, the new value of `cur` is exactly `1 << cur_ss`. The value of `cur_ss` is calculated as `ord(s[1]) - 97`, which represents the position of the second character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.). All other variables remain unchanged.
