Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of assigning types (funny or scary) to the undecided transition videos between scenarios in a way that ensures no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are shown, regardless of the order in which the scenarios are played.

### Key Points:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input, including the number of scenarios `n` and the transition matrix.
2. **Counting Known Transitions**: It counts the number of known funny (`a`) and scary (`b`) transitions for each scenario.
3. **Categorizing Scenarios**: It categorizes scenarios into those that are only funny (`sa`) and those that are only scary (`sb`).
4. **Assigning Undecided Transitions**: Based on the counts, it assigns the undecided transitions ('?'):
   - If there are more or equal funny scenarios, it assigns the first `n // 4` undecided transitions to 'F' and the rest to 'S'.
   - If there are more scary scenarios, it assigns the first `n // 4` undecided transitions to 'S' and the rest to 'F'.
5. **Output**: It prints the modified transition matrix.

### Analysis:
- **Correct Handling of Known Transitions**: The program correctly handles the known transitions and counts them accurately.
- **Balancing Undecided Transitions**: The logic for assigning undecided transitions is designed to balance the number of consecutive funny and scary videos. However, the logic of assigning the first `n // 4` transitions to one type and the rest to another might not always ensure the required constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.
- **Symmetry**: The program ensures that the transition matrix remains symmetric, which is a requirement of the problem.

### Potential Issues:
- **Consecutive Videos Constraint**: The current logic of assigning the first `n // 4` transitions to one type and the rest to another might not always prevent more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type. This is because the assignment is done independently for each scenario, and it doesn't consider the overall sequence of transitions when scenarios are played in any order.
- **Edge Cases**: The program might not handle edge cases where the number of scenarios is very small (e.g., `n = 2` or `n = 3`) or where the distribution of known transitions is highly skewed.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity of ensuring the constraint on consecutive videos of the same type, the current logic might not always produce a valid solution. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
