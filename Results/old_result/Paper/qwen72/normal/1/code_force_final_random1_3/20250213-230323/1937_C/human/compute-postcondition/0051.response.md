Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `k` is 3, `best` is the last index `i` for which `res` was `<`, if no such `i` exists, `best` remains 0, `res` is the new input string.**

Explanation: The code snippet `k = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `k`. All other variables (`n`, `best`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state reflects this change in `k`.
