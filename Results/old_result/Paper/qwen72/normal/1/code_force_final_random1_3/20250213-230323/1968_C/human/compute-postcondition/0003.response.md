The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer greater than 0

After executing the code, the list `x` will contain the integers provided by the user. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
