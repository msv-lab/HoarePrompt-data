Initial State: `results` is a list containing at least three results from `func_1(a, b)`, and `result` is the third element in `results`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. The `results` list contains at least three elements, each of which is the result of calling `func_1(a, b)`.
2. The variable `result` is assigned the value of the third element in the `results` list.
3. The `print(result)` statement will print the value of `result`, which is the third element in the `results` list.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, and the implementation of `func_1(a, b)` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of the third element in the `results` list. However, we know it is the result of the third call to `func_1(a, b)`.

Output: **result (where result is the third element in the results list, and each element in results is the result of calling func_1(a, b))**
