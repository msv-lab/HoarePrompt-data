The code snippet `cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

1. **Initial State Recap:**
   - `m` is greater than or equal to its original value.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than `m`.
   - `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`.
   - `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`.
   - If `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is one less than its original value.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2.
   - `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`.
   - `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1.
   - `a[i]` is in `b_values`.
   - `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.
   - If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is one more than its original value.
   - If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is not greater than 0, `ans`, `cnt_b`, and `curr` remain unchanged.
   - If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, `ans`, `cnt_b`, and `curr` remain unchanged.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1.

3. **Updated State:**
   - `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is now `cnt_b[a[i + m]] - 1`.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to its original value, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than `m`, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is one less than its original value, if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2, `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is `cnt_b[a[i + m]] - 1`, `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is one more than its original value, if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is not greater than 0, `ans`, `cnt_b`, and `curr` remain unchanged, if `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, `ans`, `cnt_b`, and `curr` remain unchanged.**
