You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 0
        
        i = 0
        
        d = n
        
        h = n
        
        p = 1
        
        g = 0
        
        if k > (n + 1) // 2:
            while s < k and d > 0:
                s += (d + 1) // 2
                d -= (d + 1) // 2
                i += 1
            while p <= i - 1:
                g += (h + 1) // 2
                h -= (h + 1) // 2
                p += 1
            f = k - g
            y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)
            print(y)
        else:
            print(2 * k - 1)
        
    #State: For each test case, if `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), the final output state after all iterations of the loop will be: `s` is the sum of the series \((d + 1) // 2\) until `s` is no longer less than `k` or `d` becomes 0, `i` is the total number of iterations, `d` is 0 or a value such that adding \((d + 1) // 2\) to `s` would make `s` exceed or equal `k`, `h` is 0, `p` is equal to `i`, `g` is the sum of \((h + 1) // 2\) for each iteration, `f` is equal to `k - g`, and `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times f - 1)\). If `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\), the final output state will be: `y` is \(2 \times k - 1\). The variables `n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g` will be reset to their initial values for each new test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
