Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The function correctly initializes the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the permutation and the array `ar`.

2. **Result Array Initialization**: The result array `res` is initialized with `None` values, which will later be filled with the elements of the permutation.

3. **MEX Calculation and Permutation Construction**:
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`. This is because initially, the MEX of an empty array is `0`, but since we are working backwards, we start with the highest possible value (`n`).
   - The loop iterates from the last element of `ar` to the first. For each index `i`, the value `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]`.
   - The condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]:` ensures that `mex` is updated to the smallest non-negative integer not present in the constructed part of the permutation. This is a crucial step to ensure that the MEX property is maintained.

4. **Output**: After constructing the permutation, the function prints the elements of `res` separated by spaces.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The function handles the constraints mentioned in the problem statement, such as the range of `t`, `n`, and the elements of `ar`.
   - The function ensures that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` from the array `a` by working backwards and maintaining the MEX property.
   - The logic ensures that the resulting permutation `p` satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` for all `i`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
