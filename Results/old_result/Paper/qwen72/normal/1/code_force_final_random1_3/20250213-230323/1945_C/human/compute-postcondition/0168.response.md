Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1. If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 100, `one` is 0, and `one_perc` is `n * 100 // (n - 1)` if the first character of `s` is '0'. If the first character of `s` is not '0': `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is 100. If `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, `lst` is [1]. If `s[i]` is not '0', `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 100, `one` is 1 or 2, and `one_perc` is `n * 100 // (n - 1)` if the first character of `s` is '0'. If the first character of `s` is not '0': `one` is 2, `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is 100. If `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, `lst` is [1].***
