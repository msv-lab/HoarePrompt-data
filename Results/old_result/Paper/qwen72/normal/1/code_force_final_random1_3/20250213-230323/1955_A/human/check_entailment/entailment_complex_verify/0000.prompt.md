You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations, and `i` is equal to `int(input()) - 1`. The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are the inputs provided for the last iteration. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, the output is `A * B`. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and if `A` is even, the output is `int(A * C / 2)`. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is odd, the output is `X * C + B`, where `X` is `A // 2`. The total number of iterations is equal to the value of `int(input())`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. Depending on the values of these integers, it prints one of the following results:
- If `B * 2` is less than `C`, it prints `A * B`.
- If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is even, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`.
- If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is odd, it prints `X * C + B`, where `X` is `A // 2`.

The function processes a total number of test cases equal to the integer value read from the first line of input. After processing all test cases, the function completes and no further state changes occur.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the price of two yogurts at the promotion price is less than twice the price of one yogurt, but it is still beneficial to use the promotion for part of the purchase and pay the regular price for the rest. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the total cost when the number of yogurts is odd and the promotion price is greater than twice the regular price.

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `1\n3 5 11`
- Expected Output: `15` (since buying 2 yogurts at the promotion price (11) and 1 yogurt at the regular price (5) totals 16, which is more expensive than buying all 3 yogurts at the regular price (15)).
- Actual Output: `16` (the program incorrectly adds the promotion price for 2 yogurts and the regular price for 1 yogurt).

This shows that the program does not always compute the minimum cost correctly.
