The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust these. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` is a throwaway variable that increments with each iteration.

Since `_` is a throwaway variable, its value is not significant for the loop condition. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. After the last iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner` and the new value of `winner` (result of `func_1(a, b)`), `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `a` and `b` are set to the new input values, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**
