Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `a` is a list of integers input by the user, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `numTest` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `opNum` is `a[0]`, `a[n-3]` is 0, `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[0]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[0]`, if `a[0]` is less than 0, `stop` is True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `stop` remains False, `a[0]` is 0, `a[1]` is `a[1] - 2 * a[0]`, `a[2]` is `a[2] - a[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[i + 2] -= opNum` updates the value of `a[2]` by subtracting `opNum` from it.
- Since `i` is 0, `i + 2` equals 2.
- `opNum` is `a[0]`.
- Therefore, `a[2]` is updated to `a[2] - a[0]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
