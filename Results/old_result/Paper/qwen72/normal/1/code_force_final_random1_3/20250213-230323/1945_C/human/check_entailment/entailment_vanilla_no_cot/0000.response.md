Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It processes multiple test cases, reads the input values, and determines the optimal position for the road based on the conditions specified. The logic checks for the satisfaction of residents on both sides of the potential road placement and ensures that the road is placed as close to the middle of the village as possible while meeting the criteria. The solution also handles edge cases, such as when the entire village can be declared as one side. The program's approach to finding the minimum absolute difference from the midpoint and selecting the smallest index in case of ties aligns with the requirements of the problem statement.
