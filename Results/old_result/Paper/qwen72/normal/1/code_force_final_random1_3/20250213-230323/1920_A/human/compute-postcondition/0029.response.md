The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so it becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i` (which is 2).

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `num` is a list. If `t` is 3, `num` contains `v`. If `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is updated to `v`. If `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`, then `start` is updated to `v`. Otherwise, `start` remains unchanged.**
