Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not directly used in the code snippet.
- `_` is 1. This variable is not directly used in the code snippet.
- `a` is an input integer greater than 0. This variable is not directly used in the code snippet.
- `s` is a new input string. This string is the focus of the code snippet.
- `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new string `s`.
- `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new string `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(x + y)
```

### Explanation:
- The code snippet prints the sum of `x` and `y`.
- `x` is the count of occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`.
- `y` is the count of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`.

### Determining the Output:
- Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `x` and `y`.
- However, the output will be the sum of the number of times 'map' appears in `s` and the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.

### Final Output:
Output: **x + y (where x is the number of times 'map' appears in the string s, and y is the number of times 'pie' appears in the string s)**
