Output State: **`n` and `m` remain as input integers with `m` being greater than 0, `a` and `b` are new input integers, `i` is the difference between the cumulative count of 1s up to index `b` (from the new input) and the cumulative count of 1s up to index `a - 1` (from the new input) in the list `c`, `s` is now `p[b] - p[a - 1]` (using the new `a` and `b`), `l` is a list of integers from the input, `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative sums of elements in `l`, `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative counts of 1s in `l`, `j` is the total count of 1s in the list `l`. The loop will execute `m-1` more times.**
