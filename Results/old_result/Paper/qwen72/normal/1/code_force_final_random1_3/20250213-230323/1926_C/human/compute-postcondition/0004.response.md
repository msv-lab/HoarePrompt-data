The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. If `num` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is an integer such that 0 <= num <= 20000. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must not be 0.

State: **`num` is an integer such that 0 < num <= 20000, `a` is the last digit of the original `num`**
