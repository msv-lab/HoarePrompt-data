The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `u` and `v`. These values replace the previous definitions of `u` and `v` (which were derived from the input minus 2). The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to `n`, the list at index `u` contains the value `v` twice, the list at index `v` in `u2vs` now includes the value `u` three times, `u` and `v` are the integers provided as input.**
