Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 0, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1. Since `i` is 1, this specifically means `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decreased by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
