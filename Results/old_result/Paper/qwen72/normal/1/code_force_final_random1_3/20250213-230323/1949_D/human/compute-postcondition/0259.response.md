The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the end of the string `nx`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `nx`, we assume it is a string. The values of `j`, `n`, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, and `sb` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'S'.**
