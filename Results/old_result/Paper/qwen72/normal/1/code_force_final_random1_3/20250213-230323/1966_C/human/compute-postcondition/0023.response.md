The value of `dp` is updated based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. Given that `i` is `n` and `arr` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order followed by 0, the difference between `arr[n]` and `arr[n + 1]` (which is 0) is `arr[n]`. If `arr[n]` is greater than 1, `dp` becomes `True`. Otherwise, `dp` becomes the logical negation of its previous value, which was `True`, so it would become `False`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`tc` is an input integer where 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4 - 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `n`, `dp` is `True` if `arr[n]` > 1, otherwise `dp` is `False`.**
