To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and conditions specified in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(n - m):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n - m - 1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `m` is greater than or equal to its original value.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than `m`.
   - `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`.
   - `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`.
   - `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2.
   - `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`.
   - `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1.
   - `a[i]` is in `b_values`.
   - `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.
   - If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is one more than its original value.
   - If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is one less than its updated value.
   - If `curr` is less than `k`, `ans` remains 0, and `cnt_b`, `curr` remain unchanged.

3. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head, it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - m`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain the same as they are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`m` is greater than or equal to its original value, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than `m`, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative after all iterations. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 2, `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is one more than its original value, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is one less than its updated value. If `curr` is less than `k`, `ans` remains 0, and `cnt_b`, `curr` remain unchanged.**
