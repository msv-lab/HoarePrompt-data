Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is the user input string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `h` is the substring of `s` from index 0 to 1 (inclusive), and the input to the loop must be a positive integer. Additionally, `h` is not '00'. If the integer value of `h` is less than or equal to 12, the program follows the logic for the if part. Otherwise, if the integer value of `h` is greater than 12, the program follows the logic for the else part.***
