Postcondition: ***`s` must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element of `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` remains unchanged and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i` > `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` â‰¤ `h` and `z` is equal to 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.***
