Output State: **`s` is a string where all occurrences of `char` (which was the first character in the original `s`) have been replaced with `unique_chars[j]`. `char` is still the first character in the original `s`, and `char` is in the set of unique characters (`unique_chars`). The length of `s` is at least 1. `j` is decreased by 1.**
