To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `array` is a list of integers derived from the new input.
   - `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'.
   - `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.
   - `ans` is a list containing `l` elements where each element is the letter corresponding to the count of the respective element in `rev_array` minus 1 in the alphabet.
   - `j` is `l-1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters: `['a', 'b', 'c', ..., 'z']`.
   - `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.
   - `ans` is constructed such that each element in `ans` corresponds to the count of the respective element in `rev_array` minus 1, mapped to a letter in the alphabet.

3. **Constructing `ans`:**
   - For each element in `rev_array`, count how many times it appears in `rev_array`.
   - Subtract 1 from this count.
   - Map this result to a letter in the alphabet using `alp`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement joins all elements of `ans` into a single string and prints it.

Given the initial state and the construction of `ans`, the output will be a string of letters where each letter corresponds to the count of the respective element in `rev_array` minus 1, mapped to a letter in the alphabet.

Output: **a string of letters where each letter corresponds to the count of the respective element in `rev_array` minus 1, mapped to a letter in the alphabet**.
