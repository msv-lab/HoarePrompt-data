The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and an array `b` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the first element of `b` is odd and the second element is not exactly two more than the first, or if the last element of `b` is odd and the second-to-last element is not exactly two more than the last. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program reflects the results of these checks for each test case.
