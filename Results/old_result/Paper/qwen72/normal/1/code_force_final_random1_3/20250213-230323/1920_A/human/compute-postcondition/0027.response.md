The value `v` is appended to the list `num`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num` is a list containing `v`, `t` and `v` are input integers. If `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is updated to `v`. If `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`, then `start` is updated to `v`. Otherwise, `start` remains unchanged.**
