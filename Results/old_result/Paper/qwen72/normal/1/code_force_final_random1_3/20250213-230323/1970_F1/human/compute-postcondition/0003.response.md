Functionality: ** The function `isPlayer` takes a string `el` of length 2, where the first character is either 'B' or 'R' and the second character is a digit from 0 to 9 or 'G'. It returns `True` if the first character is 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G'; otherwise, it returns `False`. **
