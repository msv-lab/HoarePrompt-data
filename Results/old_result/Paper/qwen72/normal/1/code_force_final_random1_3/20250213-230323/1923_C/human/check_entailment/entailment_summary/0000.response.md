Reasoning:  
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, the size of the array `n`, and the number of queries `m`. It also reads the array `l` and the queries.

2. **Cumulative Sums and Counts**: The program maintains two lists:
   - `p`: A cumulative sum of the elements in the array `l`.
   - `c`: A cumulative count of the number of 1s in the array `l`.

3. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program calculates:
   - The sum of the elements in the subarray from `a` to `b` using the cumulative sum list `p`.
   - The count of 1s in the subarray from `a` to `b` using the cumulative count list `c`.

4. **Condition Check**: The program checks if the subarray is "good" by verifying:
   - The length of the subarray is greater than 1.
   - The sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of 1s in the subarray.

   This condition ensures that there exists a valid array `b` that meets the criteria:
   - The sum of `a` equals the sum of `b`.
   - No element in `a` equals the corresponding element in `b`.
   - All elements in `b` are positive.

5. **Output**: The program prints 'YES' if the subarray is good and 'NO' otherwise.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program seems to handle all aspects of the problem correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
