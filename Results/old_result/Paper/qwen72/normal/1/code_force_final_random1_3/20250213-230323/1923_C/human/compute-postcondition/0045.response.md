The code snippet updates the value of `s` to be the difference between `p[b]` and `p[a - 1]`. This operation does not affect the values of `_`, `m`, `a`, `b`, or `i`. However, it does update the value of `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 2
- `m` must be greater than 2
- `a` and `b` are input integers
- `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`
- `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`

After executing the code snippet:
- `s` is updated to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`_` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**
