You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        print(year)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of signs. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        year = 0
        
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        
        print(year)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `n` has been an input integer for each iteration, `a` has been a new list of integers provided by the user for each iteration, and `year` has been calculated as the sum of `(year % ai or ai)` for each `ai` in the list `a` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of test cases, each consisting of a number of signs and their periodicities. For each test case, it calculates a specific value (`year`) based on the periodicities and prints this value. The function does not return any values; instead, it outputs the results directly to the console. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the year when the \(n\)-th sign occurs, given that each sign \(i\) occurs every \(a_i\) years.
   - The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the \(i\)-th sign must occur before the \((i+1)\)-th sign can start occurring.

2. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - For each test case, we initialize the year to 0.
   - For each sign \(a_i\), we need to find the next year when the sign occurs, starting from the current year.
   - The expression `year += year % ai or ai` ensures that:
     - If `year % ai` is 0, it means the current year is already a multiple of \(a_i\), so we add \(a_i\) to the year.
     - If `year % ai` is not 0, it means the current year is not a multiple of \(a_i\), so we add the remainder to make it the next multiple of \(a_i\).

3. **Step-by-Step Verification:**
   - **Test Case 1:**
     - \(a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]\)
     - Year 0: First sign occurs at year 3.
     - Year 3: Second sign occurs at year 4.
     - Year 4: Third sign occurs at year 8.
     - Year 8: Fourth sign occurs at year 10.
     - Year 10: Fifth sign occurs at year 18.
     - Year 18: Sixth sign occurs at year 36.
     - Output: 36 (Correct)

   - **Test Case 2:**
     - \(a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\)
     - Year 0: First sign occurs at year 1.
     - Year 1: Second sign occurs at year 2.
     - Year 2: Third sign occurs at year 3.
     - Year 3: Fourth sign occurs at year 4.
     - Year 4: Fifth sign occurs at year 5.
     - Output: 5 (Correct)

   - **Test Case 3:**
     - \(a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\)
     - Year 0: First sign occurs at year 1.
     - Year 1: Second sign occurs at year 2.
     - Year 2: Third sign occurs at year 3.
     - Year 3: Fourth sign occurs at year 4.
     - Year 4: Fifth sign occurs at year 5.
     - Output: 5 (Correct)

   - **Test Case 4:**
     - \(a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]\)
     - Year 0: First sign occurs at year 50.
     - Year 50: Second sign occurs at year 60.
     - Year 60: Third sign occurs at year 711.
     - Year 711: Fourth sign occurs at year 800.
     - Year 800: Fifth sign occurs at year 1303.
     - Year 1303: Sixth sign occurs at year 2012.
     - Output: 2012 (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the year in which the \(n\)-th sign occurs for each test case, following the rules of sequential occurrences.
