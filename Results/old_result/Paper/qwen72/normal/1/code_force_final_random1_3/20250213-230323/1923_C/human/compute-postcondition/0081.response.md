To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `n` and `m` are input integers with `m > 0`.
   - `a` and `b` are input integers.
   - `i` is the difference between the cumulative count of 1s up to index `b` and the cumulative count of 1s up to index `a - 1` in the list `c`.
   - `s` is the difference between the cumulative sums of elements in the list `p` at index `b` and index `a - 1`.
   - `l` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `p` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative sums of elements in `l`.
   - `c` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative counts of 1s in `l`.
   - `j` is the total count of 1s in the list `l`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - The length of the subarray from index `a` to `b` (inclusive) is greater than 1.
   - The difference between the sum of elements in the subarray from index `a` to `b` and the length of this subarray is greater than or equal to the difference in the cumulative count of 1s between these indices.

Given these conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will always print 'YES' because the conditions provided ensure that the logic leading to the print statement is valid. The conditions are designed to check specific properties of the subarray, and if they are met, the print statement is executed.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
