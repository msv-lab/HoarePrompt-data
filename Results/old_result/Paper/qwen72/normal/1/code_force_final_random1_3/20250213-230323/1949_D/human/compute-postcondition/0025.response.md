The value of `a[j]` is incremented by 1. Given that `j` is 3, `a[3]` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the condition `2 ≤ n ≤ 24` still holds. The value of `j` also remains 3. The increment operation on `a[i]` mentioned in the initial state is not affected by this code snippet, but since `i` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact impact here.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3, `a[3]` is incremented by 1.**
