To determine what will be printed by the `print(score)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input.
   - `score` is the sum of every second element starting from the first element in `l` (i.e., the sum of elements at even indices).
   - `i` is 2 * n - 2.

2. **Understanding `score`:**
   - The variable `score` is calculated as the sum of every second element starting from the first element in the list `l`.
   - This means `score` is the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, 6, ..., up to the last even index in the list `l`.

3. **Explanation of the Print Statement:**
   - The `print(score)` statement will print the value of `score`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact values of `l` and `n` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `score`.
   - However, based on the given information, `score` is the sum of every second element starting from the first element in the list `l`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **score (where score is the sum of every second element starting from the first element in the list l)**
