Output State: **`i` is `feat[0]`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is the second element of the new `feat`, `a` is the third element of the new `feat`, `b` is the last element of the new `feat`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `array2` contains the values `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a` is true.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `feat[0]`.
- Since `i` was initially set to `n`, and `n` is now `feat[0]`, `i` is also `feat[0]`.
- The values of `f`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are derived from the elements of `feat`.
- The conditions for `test_cases`, `arr`, and `array2` remain the same as they are not affected by the code snippet.
