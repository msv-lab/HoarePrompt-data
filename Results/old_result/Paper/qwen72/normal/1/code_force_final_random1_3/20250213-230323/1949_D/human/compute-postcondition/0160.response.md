Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 2, `nx` is now `nx + xx[2][1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24.
- The value of `j` remains 2.
- The value of `nx` is updated by adding the value of `xx[2][1]` to its current value. Therefore, the new value of `nx` is `nx + xx[2][1]`.
