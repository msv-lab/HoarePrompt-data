Output State: **If `s[1]` is '>', then `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `idx_A` is [0], `A` is [0, 1], and `x` is 1. If `s[1]` is not '>', then `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `idx_A` is an empty list, `A` is [1], and the calculation of `x` will raise an error.**
