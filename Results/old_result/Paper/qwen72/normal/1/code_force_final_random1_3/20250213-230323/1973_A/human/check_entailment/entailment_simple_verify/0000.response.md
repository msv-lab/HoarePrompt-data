### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the original assessment.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \le t \le 500\).
   - `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers \(p_1, p_2, p_3\) (where \(0 \le p_1 \le p_2 \le p_3 \le 30\)) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates over each tuple \((p1, p2, p3)\) in `cas_de_test`.
   - It calculates the total points as `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`.
   - It checks if the total points are odd. If so, it appends `-1` to `resultats` and continues to the next tuple.
   - It calculates the total number of matches as `total_matchs = total_points // 2`.
   - It checks if `total_matchs > 3` or `p3 > total_matchs`. If either condition is true, it appends `-1` to `resultats` and continues to the next tuple.
   - It calculates the number of draws as `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
   - If `egalites < 0`, it appends `-1` to `resultats`. Otherwise, it appends `egalites // 2` to `resultats`.

3. **Evaluation of Conditions:**
   - **Odd Total Points:** This condition is correct. If the total points are odd, it is impossible to achieve the scores with the given rules.
   - **Total Matches Greater Than 3:** This condition is too restrictive. The total number of matches can indeed be greater than 3. For example, in the case \((0, 0, 6)\), the total points are 6, which is even, and the total matches are 3. However, the program incorrectly returns `-1` because `p3 > total_matchs` is true, even though this is a valid scenario where all games could have ended in draws.
   - **Number of Draws Calculation:** The formula for calculating the number of draws is correct. It ensures that the number of draws is non-negative and consistent with the given scores.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - **Input: (0, 0, 6)**
     - Total points: \(0 + 0 + 6 = 6\) (even)
     - Total matches: \(6 // 2 = 3\)
     - Condition `p3 > total_matchs` is true (\(6 > 3\)), so the program returns `-1`.
     - **Expected Output:** The correct output should be 3 (since all 3 matches could have ended in draws).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program is incorrect because it incorrectly returns `-1` for valid scenarios where the total number of matches can be greater than 3 and `p3` can be greater than the total matches.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
