You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        score = 0
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        print(score)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, representing the numbers written on the whiteboard.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        
        score = 0
        
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        
        print(score)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the last input, `score` is the sum of every second element starting from the first element in `l` (i.e., the sum of `l[0]`, `l[2]`, `l[4]`, ..., `l[2*n-2]`), and the loop has completed all its iterations for all `t` test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We have `2n` integers on a whiteboard.
   - We need to perform `n` moves where each move involves selecting two integers, adding the minimum of the two to our score, and then removing both integers.
   - The goal is to maximize the score.

2. **Approach Analysis:**
   - To maximize the score, we should always try to pair the smallest available integers together. This ensures that the minimum value added to the score is as large as possible.
   - Sorting the list of integers helps in achieving this because the smallest integers will be at the beginning of the sorted list.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - It sorts the list of integers.
   - It initializes the score to 0.
   - It iterates over the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element) and adds it to the score. This is because the sorted list ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, and the minimum of each pair is the first element in each pair.
   - Finally, it prints the score for each test case.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly sorts the list of integers.
   - It correctly iterates over the sorted list, taking every second element and adding it to the score.
   - This approach ensures that the minimum value of each pair is added to the score, which is the optimal way to maximize the score.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and will produce the maximum possible score for each test case.
