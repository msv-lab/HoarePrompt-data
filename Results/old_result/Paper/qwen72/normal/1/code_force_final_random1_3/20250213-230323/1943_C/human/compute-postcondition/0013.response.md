The code `u2vs[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list at index `v` in the `u2vs` list. Given the initial conditions, the list at index `v` already includes the value `u` appended to it. After executing the code, the list at index `v` will contain the value `u` one more time.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to `n`, the list at index `u` contains the value `v` twice, the list at index `v` in `u2vs` now includes the value `u` three times, `u` is the first integer provided as input minus 2, `v` is the second integer provided as input minus 2.**
