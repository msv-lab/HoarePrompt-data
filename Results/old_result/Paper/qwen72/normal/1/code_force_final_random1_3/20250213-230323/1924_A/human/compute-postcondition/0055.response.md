To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations involved:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `k-1`.
- `ans` is updated to `ans + tmp + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`.
- `tmp` remains unchanged.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`) remain unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: 
   - `i` is set to `k-1`.

2. **Variable `ans`**:
   - `ans` is updated to `ans + tmp + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`.
   - This means the new value of `ans` is the concatenation of the current value of `ans`, the value of `tmp`, and a string of `'a'` characters repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times.

3. **Variable `tmp`**:
   - `tmp` remains unchanged, so its value is the same as it was before the update.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, and `cur` remain unchanged.

### Calculation:
- The value of `ans` after the update will be the concatenation of the original value of `ans`, the value of `tmp`, and a string of `'a'` characters repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times.

### Final Output:
- The `print(ans)` statement will print the updated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans + tmp + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1) (where ans is the original value of ans, tmp is the value of tmp, n is the value of n, cnt is the value of cnt)**
