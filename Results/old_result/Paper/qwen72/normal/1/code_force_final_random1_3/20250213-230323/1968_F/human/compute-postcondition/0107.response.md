Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `5 + n + 2 * q + 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 3]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `a[1]` set to `int(data[idx - 2])` and `a[2]` set to `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `pf[1]` set to `a[1]` and `pf[2]` set to `pf[1] ^ a[2]`, `mp` is a dictionary with either one key-value pair `{0: [0]}` or two key-value pairs `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1]}` depending on whether `pf[1]` is in `mp` or not. If `pf[2]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[2]]` is an empty list. `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional empty string at the end, `i` is 2, `mp[pf[2]]` now contains `[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The line `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list corresponding to the key `pf[2]` in the dictionary `mp`.
- Since `i` is 2, `pf[2]` is the key being accessed in the dictionary `mp`.
- The value of `pf[2]` was initially either an empty list or a list containing `[1]` if `pf[1]` was equal to `pf[2]`.
- After executing the code, `mp[pf[2]]` now contains `[2]` (or `[1, 2]` if `pf[1]` was equal to `pf[2]`).
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
