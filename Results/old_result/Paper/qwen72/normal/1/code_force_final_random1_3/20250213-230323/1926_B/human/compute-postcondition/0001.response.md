To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` is greater than 0. The variable `i` should start from 0, as is typical for a `range(a)` loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the size of the grid.
- Each grid is represented by a list of `n` strings, each string containing `n` characters ('0' or '1').
- The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'.
- `a` is an input integer.

For the loop to execute:
- `a` must be greater than 0.
- `i` should start from 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure these conditions are met.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, each grid is a list of `n` strings, each string containing `n` characters ('0' or '1'), the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1', `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
