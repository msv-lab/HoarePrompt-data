Postcondition: ***`j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged. If `xx[i][2]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][2]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'F'.***
