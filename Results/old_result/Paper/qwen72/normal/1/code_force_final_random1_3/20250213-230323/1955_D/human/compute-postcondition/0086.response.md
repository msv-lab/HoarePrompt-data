The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This operation updates the values of these variables based on the input.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

- `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated with new values from the input.
- The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ n. After the code execution, `n` and `m` will take the new values provided by the input, but they must still satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ m ≤ n and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- Similarly, `k` is updated with a new value from the input, and it must still satisfy the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ m.

The other variables (`a`, `i`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`, `t`, `b`, `max_val`, `curr`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` remains a list of integers, `i` has iterated through all elements in `b_values`, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ n (new value from input), `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 with all elements in `b_values` having their corresponding `cnt_b` values set to 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 (new value from input), `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ m (new value from input), `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, and `curr` is the number of elements in `a[n-m:n]` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is the total number of valid subarrays found during the loop execution. Otherwise, `ans` is the total number of valid subarrays found minus one.**
