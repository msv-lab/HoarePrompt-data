Output State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, `func_15()` has been called as many times as the value returned by `func_10()`, and its result (which is a value) has been printed to the console for each call.**

This means that the loop will run for the number of times specified by the value returned by `func_10()`. During each iteration, `func_15()` is called, and its result is printed to the console. After all iterations, `func_15()` will have been called exactly as many times as the value returned by `func_10()`, and each call's result will have been printed to the console.
