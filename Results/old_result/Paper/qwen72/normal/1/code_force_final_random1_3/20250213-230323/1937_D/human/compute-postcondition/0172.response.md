The code snippet assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to the variable `b`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2.
- `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
- `j` is `n`.
- `i` is `2`.
- `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * r`.

The code snippet `b = A[l - 1]` updates the value of `b` to the value at index `l - 1` in the list `A`. Since `l` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume `l` is a valid index within the bounds of `A`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `2`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1]`.**
