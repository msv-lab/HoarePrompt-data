The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` depends on the value of `x`. If `x` is not 1, `j` was initially 0, so it becomes 1. If `x` is 1, `j` was initially 2, so it becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers read from user input that must have at least 3 elements, `p` is `[0, x, 2 * x]`, `i` is `2 * x`, `x` is the third element of `l`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged, if `x` is not 1 then `c` is `[0, 0, 0]` and `j` is 1, otherwise if `x` is 1 then `c` is `[0, 2, 2]` and `j` is 3.**
