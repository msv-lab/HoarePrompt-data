Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `5 + n`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and is greater than or equal to 2, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES', `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `l` is the integer value of `data[3 + n]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and `x` is currently 0. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**

This means that the values of all variables remain unchanged, but the program will proceed to the next iteration of the loop.
