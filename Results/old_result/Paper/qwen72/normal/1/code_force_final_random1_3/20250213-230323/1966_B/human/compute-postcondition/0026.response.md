Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'NO', the first character of the first string in `gr` is different from the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is `m-2`, `impossible` is True.**

Explanation:
- The variable `ans` was initially set to 'YES' but is now updated to 'NO'.
- All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, `j`, `impossible`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
