To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic leading to the value of `ans`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`a`**: A list of integers.
2. **`i`**: An index calculated as `n - m - 1`.
3. **`m`**: An integer where \(1 \leq m \leq n\).
4. **`b_values`**: A set containing the unique elements from the list `b`.
5. **`cnt_b`**: A list of length 1,000,001, presumably used to count occurrences of elements in `b`.
6. **`t`**: An integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
7. **`n`**: An integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(n > m\).
8. **`k`**: An integer where \(1 \leq k \leq m\).
9. **`b`**: A list of integers.
10. **`max_val`**: Set to 1,000,000.
11. **`curr`**: The number of elements in the sublist `a[n-m:n]` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative.
12. **`ans`**: The total number of valid subarrays found during the loop execution if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, it is the total number of valid subarrays found minus one.

### Logic Explanation:
- The variable `curr` is calculated based on the elements in the sublist `a[n-m:n]` and their presence in `b_values` with non-negative `cnt_b` values.
- The variable `ans` is determined based on the value of `curr`:
  - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is the total number of valid subarrays found.
  - If `curr` is less than `k`, `ans` is the total number of valid subarrays found minus one.

### Determining the Output:
- Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `cnt_b`, and the total number of valid subarrays are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`.
- However, based on the given conditions, the `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans` as described above.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the total number of valid subarrays found during the loop execution if curr is greater than or equal to k, otherwise it is the total number of valid subarrays found minus one)**
