The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `ar`, so we can only adjust those. The loop iterates over the indices of `ar` from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1 to continue iterating through the list. Therefore, `i` should now be `len(ar) - 3`.

State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None` except for the last element which is `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `mex` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 1] - ar[len(ar) - 2]` if `mex > mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]` else `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`.**
