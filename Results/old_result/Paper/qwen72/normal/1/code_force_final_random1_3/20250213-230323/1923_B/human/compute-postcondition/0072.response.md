Output State: **`rest` is `k - 2*delta`, `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices` and `pos` is increased by 1, `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is `-delta`, `distance` is `distance + 1`, `delta` is the minimum of `k - delta` and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos-2]]` is 0. All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) retain their initial values.**
