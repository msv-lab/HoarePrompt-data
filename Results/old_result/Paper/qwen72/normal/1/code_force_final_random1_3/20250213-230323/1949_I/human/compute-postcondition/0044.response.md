The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters based on the provided signature. However, considering the context given about the parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`, it seems these are used within the function. The function likely processes these parameters to perform some operation related to disks defined by their centers (`x`, `y`) and radii (`r`), while using `visited` to track which disks have been processed and `coef` for some additional calculations or storage.

Since no specific output is provided in the problem statement, we can infer that the function might modify the `visited` or `coef` lists in place or return some result based on the processing of the disks. Without more specific details on the expected output, we can only generalize the functionality based on the inputs.

Functionality: **The function processes a set of disks defined by their centers (`x`, `y`) and radii (`r`), using a list `visited` to track which disks have been processed and a list `coef` for additional calculations. It likely modifies these lists in place or returns a result based on the processing of the disks.**
