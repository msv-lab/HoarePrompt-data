The code snippet `suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])` appends the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]` to the list `suf`. Given the initial state where `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0, let's determine the output state:

- `i` is 0, so the elements being accessed are `suf[0]` and `l[0]`.
- The value `suf[0] + l[0]` is calculated and appended to `suf`.
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `suf` now includes an additional element which is `suf[0] + l[0]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `suf` now includes an additional element which is `suf[0] + l[0]`.**
