Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_j < 2^31) and must have at least 1 element, `res` is 1, `count` is a dictionary with the key `(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num` and its value is 1, `num` is the first element of `a`.** 

Explanation: The value of `res` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
