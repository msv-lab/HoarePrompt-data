Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. If `m` equals `n - 1`, the program takes no additional action. If `m` does not equal `n - 1`, and either `n` or `m` is odd, the program also takes no additional action.***
