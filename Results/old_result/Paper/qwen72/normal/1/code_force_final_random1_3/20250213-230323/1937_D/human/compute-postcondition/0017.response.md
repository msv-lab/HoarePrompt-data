Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `len(idx_A) == 0`, then `A` is a list containing [0], and `idx_A` is a list containing [0] if the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', otherwise `A` is a list containing [0] and `idx_A` remains an empty list. If `len(idx_A) != 0`, then if `s[1]` is '>', `idx_A` is [0], `A` is [0, 1], and `x` is 1. If `s[1]` is not '>', `idx_A` is an empty list, `A` is [1], and the calculation of `x` will raise an error.***
