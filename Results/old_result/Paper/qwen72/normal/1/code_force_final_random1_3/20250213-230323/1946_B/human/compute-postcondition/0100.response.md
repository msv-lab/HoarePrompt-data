The value of `sm` is updated to `sm % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Since `sm` was initially `(2 + suf[n])` and `sm` is greater than or equal to 0, the new value of `sm` will be the remainder when `(2 + suf[n])` is divided by `10 ** 9 + 7`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `sm` is `(2 + suf[n]) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, and `sm` is greater than or equal to 0.**
