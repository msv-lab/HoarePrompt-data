Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers with at least one element, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is equal to `arr[len(arr) - 1]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `tem` is updated to be the product of its current value (which was 1) and the last element of the list `arr` (since `i` is `len(arr) - 1`). The other variables (`arr`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
