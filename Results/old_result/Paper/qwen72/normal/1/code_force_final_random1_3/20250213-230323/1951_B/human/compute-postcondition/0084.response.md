Postcondition: ***`s` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `s` (s[2]), and `j` is increased by 1. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `h` is greater than or equal to `i`, `ans` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
