To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input
- `idx` is 1
- Each test case consists of two integers n and q where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5
- The array a contains n integers a_1, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30
- Each query is represented by two integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n
- The sum of n over all test cases and the sum of q over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5
- `results` is an empty list

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`data`, `idx`, `results`, etc.) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is 1, each test case consists of two integers n and q where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, the array a contains n integers a_1, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, each query is represented by two integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases and the sum of q over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `results` is an empty list**
