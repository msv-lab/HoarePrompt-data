Output State: **`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `l` (now `l + 1`), `m` (now 0), `i` (now 1), `s` (index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order), `ql` (decremented by `a[s - 1]`), `ql` is now an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `ql = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `ql`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The new value of `ql` is an input integer, which replaces the previous value of `ql` (which was decremented by `a[s - 1]`).
- The initial conditions for `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `l` (now `l + 1`), `m` (now 0), `i` (now 1), and `s` (index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order) remain valid.
