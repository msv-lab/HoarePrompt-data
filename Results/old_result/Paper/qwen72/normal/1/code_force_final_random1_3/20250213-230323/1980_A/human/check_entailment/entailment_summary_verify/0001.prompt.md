You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases` as inputs. Each tuple in `test_cases` consists of a tuple `(n, m)` and a string `a`, where `n` is the number of problems, `m` is the number of rounds, and `a` is a string of problem difficulties. The function calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case to ensure that each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') appears at least `m` times. It returns a list `results` containing `t` integers, each representing the number of additional problems required for the corresponding test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input format by defining `t` and `test_cases`. It iterates over the test cases using a loop, which is appropriate for processing multiple test cases.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: For each test case, the program initializes a frequency array `freq` of size 7 (to account for difficulties 'A' to 'G'). It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `freq` array based on the character's position in the alphabet. This is done using `ord(prob) - ord('A')`, which correctly maps 'A' to 0, 'B' to 1, and so on.

3. **Missing Problems Calculation**: The program calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level by computing `max(0, m - f)` for each frequency `f` in the `freq` array. This ensures that if there are already enough problems of a certain difficulty, no additional problems are needed. The `sum` function then adds up these values to get the total number of missing problems.

4. **Output**: The program appends the result for each test case to the `results` list and prints each result at the end. This matches the expected output format.

Given the above steps, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
