The code snippet `x, n = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from the input, splits them by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `n` respectively.

- The initial values of `x` and `n` are updated based on the input.
- The value of `t` remains unchanged.
- The value of `q` remains 0.
- The input value must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer input value where 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer input value where 1 <= n <= x, `q` is 0, and the input value must be greater than 0.**
