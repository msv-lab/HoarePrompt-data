Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string containing the input with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr[::-1]` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.**

Explanation:
- `z` is assigned the value of the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`) retain their initial values.
