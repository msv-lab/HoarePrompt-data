To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object `lst` in the loop head. The loop will execute if `lst` is not empty. The other variables mentioned (`i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `mini`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the state before the loop starts, `lst` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. The other variables can remain as they are since they do not affect the loop's ability to start.

State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the processed part of `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the remaining part of `s`, `lst` contains at least one element, `mini` is the minimum of its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, and `final` remain unchanged, except `final` is now an empty list.**
