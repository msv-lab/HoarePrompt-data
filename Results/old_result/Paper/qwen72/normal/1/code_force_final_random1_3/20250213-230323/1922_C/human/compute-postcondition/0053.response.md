Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers from user input.
- `d1` is a `defaultdict` initialized with a default value of 0.
- `d2` is a `defaultdict` initialized with a default value of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is set to 1.
- `m` is an input integer greater than 2.
- `j` is 2.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the latest user input.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

### Analysis:
- `d1` is a `defaultdict` with a default value of 0. This means that if a key is accessed that does not exist in `d1`, it will return 0.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the latest user input. Since the initial state does not specify any modifications to `d1` based on `x` or `y`, the values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]` will both be 0 (the default value).

### Calculation:
- `d1[y]` will be 0 because `y` is not explicitly set in `d1`.
- `d1[x]` will also be 0 because `x` is not explicitly set in `d1`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the result of `d1[y] - d1[x]`, which is \(0 - 0 = 0\).

Output: **0**
