Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer from the last input, `n` is the second integer from the last input, `q` is `t - 1`, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, and `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` such that `x - n * d` is non-negative and divisible by `d`, where `d` is a divisor of `x` and `d` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`. If no such divisor exists, `ans` remains 1.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The total number of test cases, which remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`x` and `n`**: These are the inputs for the last iteration of the loop. For each iteration, `x` and `n` are read from the input, so after the loop finishes, they will hold the values from the last test case.
- **`q`**: This is the loop counter, which increments with each iteration. After all `t` iterations, `q` will be `t - 1`.
- **`i`**: This is the inner loop counter, which iterates from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` for each test case. After the inner loop completes, `i` will be `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
- **`ans`**: This variable holds the result of the computation for the current test case. It is updated within the inner loop to store the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the given conditions. If no such divisor exists, `ans` remains 1. After the loop finishes, `ans` will hold the final result for the last test case.
