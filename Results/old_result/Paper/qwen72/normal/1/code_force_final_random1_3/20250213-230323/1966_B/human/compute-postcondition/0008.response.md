The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing two input strings, `i` is 2**
