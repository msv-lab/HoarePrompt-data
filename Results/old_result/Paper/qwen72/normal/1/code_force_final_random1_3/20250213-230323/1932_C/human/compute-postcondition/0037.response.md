Output State: **The program returns the list `ans` in reverse order, where `ans` contains `n` elements, each being the cumulative product of the elements in `b` (from the last to the first) taken modulo `m`. The cumulative product is calculated as the product of all elements in `b` taken modulo `m`.**
