Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the new list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)` and additional entries for each string `s` in `line` that is not '..' with the value `(0, index_of_s)`, `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is now a list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with entries for each string `s` in `line` that represents a player, with the value `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists. The first list contains tuples `(0, index_of_s)` for each string `s` in `line` that starts with 'B' and ends with 'G'. The second list contains tuples `(0, index_of_s)` for each string `s` in `line` that starts with 'R' and ends with 'G'.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the new list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)` and an updated entry for `line[0]` with the value `(1, 0)` if `line[0]` is not '..'. `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input and must have at least one element, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with entries for each string `s` in `line` that represents a player, with the value `False`. `goal` is a list containing two lists. The first list contains tuples `(0, index_of_s)` for each string `s` in `line` that starts with 'B' and ends with 'G'. The second list contains tuples `(0, index_of_s)` for each string `s` in `line` that starts with 'R' and ends with 'G'. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is a player, `allPlayers` has the value `False` for `line[0]`. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is not a player and the second character is 'G', the first list in `goal` also contains the tuple `(1, 0)`, and `tmp` is 0. `ind` is 0. If `line[0]` is '..' then none of these updates occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the new list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)`. If `line[0]` is not '..' and `line[1]` is not '..', `elements` includes an entry for `line[0]` with the value `(1, 0)` and an entry for `line[1]` with the value `(1, 1)`. `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input and must have at least two elements, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with entries for each string `s` in `line` that represents a player, with the value `False`. `goal` is a list containing two lists. The first list contains tuples `(0, index_of_s)` for each string `s` in `line` that starts with 'B' and ends with 'G'. The second list contains tuples `(0, index_of_s)` for each string `s` in `line` that starts with 'R' and ends with 'G'. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is a player, `allPlayers` has the value `False` for `line[0]` and `line[1]`. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is not a player and the second character is 'G', the first list in `goal` also contains the tuple `(1, 0)`, and `tmp` is 0. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(1, 1)` appended to it. If `line[ind][1]` is not 'G', no changes are made to `goal` or `tmp`. `ind` is 1. If `line[0]` is '..' or `line[1]` is '..', none of these updates occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the new list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)`. If `line[0]` is not '..' and `line[1]` is not '..', `elements` includes an entry for `line[0]` with the value `(1, 0)` and an entry for `line[1]` with the value `(1, 1)`. `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input and must have at least three elements, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with entries for each string `s` in `line` that represents a player, with the value `False`. `goal` is a list containing two lists. The first list contains tuples `(0, index_of_s)` for each string `s` in `line` that starts with 'B' and ends with 'G'. The second list contains tuples `(0, index_of_s)` for each string `s` in `line` that starts with 'R' and ends with 'G'. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is a player, `allPlayers` has the value `False` for `line[0]`, `line[1]`, and `line[2]`. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is not a player and the second character is 'G', the first list in `goal` also contains the tuple `(1, 0)`, and `tmp` is 0. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', the tuple `(1, 2)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`, where `tmp` is 0 if `line[2][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. If `line[ind][1]` is not 'G', no changes are made to `goal` or `tmp`. `ind` is 2. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is a player, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. If `line[ind]` is not '..' and is a player, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. If `line[ind]` is not '..' and is not a player and the second character is 'G', the tuple `(1, 2)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`, where `tmp` is 0 if `line[2][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. If `line[ind]` is '..' or not a player and the second character is not 'G', no changes are made to `goal` or `tmp`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
