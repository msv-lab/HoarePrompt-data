Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 2, `zero` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[i]` is '0' or '1', respectively, `one` is 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[i]` is '0' or '1', respectively, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 2`, `one_perc` is \((o - one) * 100 // (n - 2)\). If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is [1, 2]. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The value of `one` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
