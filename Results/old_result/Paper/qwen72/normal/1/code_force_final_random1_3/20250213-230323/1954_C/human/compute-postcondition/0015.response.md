Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `new` is a list where `new[0]` is the maximum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `new[2]` is the maximum of `a[2]` and `b[2]`, `new[3]` is the maximum of `a[3]` and `b[3]`, `new2` is a list of `None` with the same length as `a`, `i` is 3, `a[0] == b[0]`, `new2[0]` is `a[0]`, `a[1] == b[1]`, `new2[2]` is the minimum of `a[2]` and `b[2]`, `len(a)` must be greater than 3, `a[3]` must be equal to `b[3]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])` updates the value of `new[i]` to the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- Given that `i` is 3, `new[3]` is updated to the maximum of `a[3]` and `b[3]`.
- Since `a[3]` is equal to `b[3]`, `new[3]` will be equal to `a[3]` (or `b[3]`).
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
