Output State: **_ is t-1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the last input integer greater than 0, `s` is the last input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the last `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the last `s`.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the loop variable `_` will have the value `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration. The variable `t` remains within its original bounds (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the variables `a`, `s`, `x`, and `y` will hold their respective values from the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `a` will be the last input integer, `s` will be the last input string, `x` will be the count of 'map' in the last `s`, and `y` will be the count of 'pie' in the last `s`.
