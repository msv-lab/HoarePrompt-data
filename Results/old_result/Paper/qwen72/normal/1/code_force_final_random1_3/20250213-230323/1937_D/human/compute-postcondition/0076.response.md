Output State: **`s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `0`, `l` is `0`, `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, and `l` is greater than or equal to `r`. Additionally, `r` is greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `a` is calculated using the formula `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
- `B[r - 1]` is the cumulative count of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, at the index `r - 1`.
- `idx_B[r - 1]` is the index of the last '<' character in the string.
- `i` is 0.
- `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`.
- The new value of `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 0) * r`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
