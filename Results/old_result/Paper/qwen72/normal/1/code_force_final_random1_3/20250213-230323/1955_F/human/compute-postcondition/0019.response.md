Postcondition: ***`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, and `cnt` is 0. If the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, `cnt` is updated to `1 +` the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in `a`. Otherwise, `cnt` is updated to the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in `a`.***
