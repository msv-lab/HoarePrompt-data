Initial State: `results` is a list containing at least two results from `func_1(a, b)`, and `result` is the second element in `results`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. The list `results` contains at least two elements, where each element is a result from the function `func_1(a, b)`.
2. The variable `result` is assigned the value of the second element in the `results` list.
3. The `print(result)` statement will print the value of `result`, which is the second element in the `results` list.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, and the implementation of `func_1(a, b)` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of the second element in `results`. However, we know that it is the result of calling `func_1(a, b)` with some specific arguments.

Output: **result (where result is the second element in the results list, and each element in results is a result from func_1(a, b))**
