Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers with at least 3 elements, `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr` followed by `tem`, `tem` is equal to `arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2] * arr[len(arr) - 3]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 3`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `tem` is updated to be the product of its previous value (`arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`) and `arr[i]` (which is `arr[len(arr) - 3]`).
- The values of `arr`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
