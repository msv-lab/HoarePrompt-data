Output State: **`a` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by spaces, `y` is 0, `a_values` is an empty list, `b` is an iterable that has been fully iterated over, `b_values` is an empty list, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `custo` is 0, `custos` now includes the value of `custo`, `i` is `i_last + 1`, `x` must be greater than `i_last + 1`, `nf` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which is then assigned to `a`.
- All other variables (`y`, `a_values`, `b`, `b_values`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `custo`, `custos`, `i`, `x`, `nf`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
