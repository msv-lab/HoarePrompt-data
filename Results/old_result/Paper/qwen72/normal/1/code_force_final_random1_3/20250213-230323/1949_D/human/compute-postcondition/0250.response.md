Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged. If the character at position 0 in the string `xx[1]` is not '?', then `nx` is set to this character. If the character at position 0 in the string `xx[1]` is '?', then `nx` is set to 'S' if `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`; otherwise, `nx` is set to 'F'.***
