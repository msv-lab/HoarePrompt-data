Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3, `nx` is the original value of `nx` concatenated with 'S'.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `j` is 3, and `nx` is determined based on certain conditions.
- The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the string 'S' to the existing value of `nx`.
- Since the exact value of `nx` is not explicitly given, it remains as the original value of `nx` concatenated with 'S'.
- The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
