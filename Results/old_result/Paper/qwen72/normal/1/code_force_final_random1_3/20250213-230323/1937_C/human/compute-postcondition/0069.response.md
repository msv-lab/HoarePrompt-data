Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` remains 1 if no such `i` exists where `res` was `<`, `best` is 2, `res` is the input string.**

Explanation:
- The code `best = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `best`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `best` while keeping the rest of the variables as they were initially.
