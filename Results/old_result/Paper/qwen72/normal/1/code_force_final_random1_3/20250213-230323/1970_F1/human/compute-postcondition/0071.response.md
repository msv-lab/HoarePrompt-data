Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the new list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)` and an entry for each string `s` in the new `line` that is not '..' with the value `(1, index_of_s)`, `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is a new list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with entries for each string `s` in the new `line` that represents a player, with the value `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists. The first list contains tuples `(0, index_of_s)` for each string `s` in the new `line` that starts with 'B' and ends with 'G'. The second list contains tuples `(0, index_of_s)` for each string `s` in the new `line` that starts with 'R' and ends with 'G'. If the element at index `ind` in the new `line` is not '..' and the second character is 'G', the tuple `(1, index_of_s)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`, where `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the string is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.**
