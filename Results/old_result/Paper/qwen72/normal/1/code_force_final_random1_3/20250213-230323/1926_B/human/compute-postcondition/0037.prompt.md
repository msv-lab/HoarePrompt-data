Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, each grid is a list of `n` strings, each string containing `n` characters ('0' or '1'), the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'. `a` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `k` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b = input()
    if '1' in b:
        k.append(b.count('1'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is a placeholder for the loop counter, `int(input())` must be a positive integer, `b` is the user input. If `b` contains the character '1', `k` now includes the count of '1's in `b`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`_` is incremented by 1, `int(input())` must be a positive integer, `b` is the user input (a string representation of a positive integer). If `b` contains the character '1', `k` now includes the count of '1's in `b`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`_` is incremented by 1, `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than the new value of `_`, `b` is the user input (a string representation of a positive integer). If `b` contains the character '1', `k` now includes the count of '1's in `b`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
