Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. Mathematically, this is:
   \[
   \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})
   \]

2. **Optimal Rearrangement**: The optimal way to maximize the beauty is to sort the array in ascending order. This ensures that the differences \(a_i - a_{i-1}\) are maximized for the largest elements and minimized for the smallest elements.

3. **Simplification**: When the array is sorted, the beauty simplifies to:
   \[
   \text{Beauty} = (a_n - a_{n-1}) + (a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}) + \cdots + (a_2 - a_1)
   \]
   All intermediate terms cancel out, leaving:
   \[
   \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1
   \]
   This means the maximum beauty is simply the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the array.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array.
   - It prints the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted array.

5. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly sorts the array.
   - It computes the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, which is the correct approach to maximize the beauty.
   - The program handles multiple test cases as required.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
