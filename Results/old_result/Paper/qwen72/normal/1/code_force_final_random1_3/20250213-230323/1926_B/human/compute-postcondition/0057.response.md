The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of '1' in the string `b` to the list `k`. Given that `b` is the new user input string and if '1' is in `b`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in the new `b`. Otherwise, `k` remains an empty list.

Since the initial state specifies that `b` is the new user input string and if '1' is in the new `b`, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in the new `b`, the code will append the count of '1' in `b` to `k`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`_` is 2, `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is greater than 2, `b` is the new user input string, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in the new `b`.**
