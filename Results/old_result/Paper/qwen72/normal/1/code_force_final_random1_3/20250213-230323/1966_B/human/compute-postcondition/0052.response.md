The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing two input strings, `i` is 2, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is `False`**
