Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the maximum number of matches a specific cow (identified by index `k`) can win in a series of matches, where the winner of each match faces the next cow in line. The program allows for a single swap of the cow at index `k` with any other cow to maximize the number of wins.

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of wins by considering the following scenarios:
1. If there are no cows with a higher rating than the cow at index `k`, the cow can win all remaining matches, which is `n - 1`.
2. If there is exactly one cow with a higher rating:
   - If this cow is at index 0, the cow at index `k` can win `k - 1` matches before facing the stronger cow.
   - If this cow is at an index greater than `k`, the cow at index `k` can win up to the index of the stronger cow minus 1.
   - If this cow is at an index less than or equal to `k`, the cow at index `k` can win the maximum of either the distance from `k` to the stronger cow or the distance from the start to the stronger cow minus 1.
3. If there are two cows with higher ratings:
   - If the first stronger cow is at index 0, the cow at index `k` can win the minimum of either the distance to the second stronger cow minus 1 or `k - 1`.
   - If the cow at index `k` is beyond the second stronger cow, the cow can win the maximum of either the distance to the first stronger cow minus 1 or the distance between the two stronger cows.
   - If the cow at index `k` is before or at the second stronger cow, the cow can win the maximum of either the distance to the first stronger cow minus 1 or the distance from the first stronger cow to `k`.

The function handles all these cases appropriately and returns the correct number of wins based on the given conditions. The logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
