Reasoning:  
The program aims to maximize the sum of an array by performing operations that set a subarray to its MEX value. The core logic is implemented through recursive calls and condition checks to decide whether to apply the operation or split the problem into smaller subproblems.

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function is responsible for applying the operation to a subarray if certain conditions are met. It checks if the current subarray can be set to a specific value (MEX) and updates the array and the operations list accordingly. The function correctly handles the base case where `l` equals `r` and ensures that the operation is only applied when necessary.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function initializes the process by calling a recursive function (`recursive_maximize_sum`) to handle the entire array. However, there is a mistake in the function call; it should pass the `a` and `ops` lists to `recursive_maximize_sum` instead of just the indices. This oversight means that the operations are not being tracked correctly, and the final sum and operations count might be incorrect.

3. **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**: This function recursively divides the array into subarrays and applies the operation when the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to the square of its length. The logic here is sound and aligns with the problem's requirements. However, it relies on the correct initialization and passing of the `ops` list from `func_2`.

4. **Function 4 (`func_3`)**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the result, and prints the output. The function itself is correct, but it depends on the correctness of `func_2`.

Given the issue in `func_2` where the `ops` list is not passed correctly to `recursive_maximize_sum`, the program will not track the operations correctly, leading to an incorrect solution.

Correctness: **False**
