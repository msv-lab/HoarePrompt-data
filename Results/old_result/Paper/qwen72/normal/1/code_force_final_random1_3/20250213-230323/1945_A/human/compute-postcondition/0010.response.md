The value of `b` is incremented by the value of `c`. The values of `a` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the first integer in `s`, `b` is the second integer in `s` plus the third integer in `s`, `c` is the third integer in `s`, and `s` is the next element in the list `[*open(0)][1:]`.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer in `s`, `b` is the second integer in `s` plus the third integer in `s`, `c` is the third integer in `s`, and `s` is the next element in the list `[*open(0)][1:]`.**
