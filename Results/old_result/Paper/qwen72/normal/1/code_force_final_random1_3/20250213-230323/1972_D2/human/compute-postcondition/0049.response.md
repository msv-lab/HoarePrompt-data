To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `x` is 4
   - `y` is 3
   - `n` is at least 20
   - `m` is at least 5
   - `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1.

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` must be true.
   - Given `x` is 4 and `y` is 3:
     - `(x + y) * x = (4 + 3) * 4 = 7 * 4 = 28`
     - `(x + y) * y = (4 + 3) * 3 = 7 * 3 = 21`

4. **Check Conditions:**
   - For `(x + y) * x <= n` to be true, `n` must be at least 28.
   - For `(x + y) * y <= m` to be true, `m` must be at least 21.

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `n` is at least 20, it needs to be adjusted to at least 28.
   - Since `m` is at least 5, it needs to be adjusted to at least 21.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `x` remains 4
- `y` remains 3
- `n` must be at least 28
- `m` must be at least 21
- `cnt` remains as defined

State: **`x` is 4, `y` is 3, `n` must be at least 28, `m` must be at least 21, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
