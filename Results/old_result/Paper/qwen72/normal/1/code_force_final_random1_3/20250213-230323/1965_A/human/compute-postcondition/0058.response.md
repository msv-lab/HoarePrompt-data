The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `lis`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `lis` and the value of `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than the length of `lis`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `j` becomes 2), and `lis` must still have at least 2 elements (since `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `len(lis) - 1`).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` should be 2.
- `lis` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 3 elements, `j` is 2, `test` is True**
