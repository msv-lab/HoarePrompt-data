The code `ans.append(2 ** i)` appends the value of `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 2, the value `2 ** 2` (which is 4) is appended to `ans`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:

- `ans` now contains `[1, 2, 4]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `lk`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with new values assigned by `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `l` is the length of the binary string `b`. `k` is not equal to 1. `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `ans` is a list containing `[1, 2, 4]`. `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk` and must be at least 3, `i` is 2.**
