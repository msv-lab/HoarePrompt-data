Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `l` is a list of integers read from input, `p` is a list containing the single element 0, `c` is a list containing the single element 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0.**

The variables `i` and `j` are both set to 0. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
