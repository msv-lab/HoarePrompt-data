The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to a string, sorts the resulting list of strings, and returns this sorted list. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned a sorted list of strings derived from the user's input.
