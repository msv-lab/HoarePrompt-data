Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing three elements: the original list `line`, the new list `line`, and the new list `line` again, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)` and an entry for each string `s` in the new `line` that is not '..' with the value `(1, index_of_s)`, `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is a new list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input and must have at least two elements, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with entries for each string `s` in the new `line` that represents a player, with the value `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists, `ind` is 1. If `line[0]` is not '..': `elements` includes an additional entry for `line[0]` with the value `(2, 0)`. If `line[0]` is a player, `allPlayers[line[0]]` is `False`. If the second character of `line[0]` is 'G', `goal[1]` now includes the tuple `(2, 0)` and `tmp` is 1. `elements` now includes an entry for `line[1]` with the value `(2, 1)`. If `line[1]` is a player, `allPlayers[line[1]]` is `False`. If the second character of `line[1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[1]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(2, 1)`.***
