Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, each grid is a list of `n` strings, each string containing `n` characters ('0' or '1'), the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1', `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's in the string representations of `b` for each iteration where '1' was found in `b`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
- The variable `n` remains an integer within the specified range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10).
- Each grid remains a list of `n` strings, each containing `n` characters ('0' or '1'), with the same constraints on the shape and '1's.
- The variable `a` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `i` remains 0.
- The variable `k` is now a list that contains the count of '1's in the string representation of `b` for each iteration where '1' was found in `b`. If no '1' was found in any of the inputs, `k` will be an empty list.
