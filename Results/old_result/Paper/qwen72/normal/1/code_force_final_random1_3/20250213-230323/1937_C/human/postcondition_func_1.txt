The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, both of which must be within the range [0, n) where n is the length of some permutation `p`. It prints the string "! [a] [b]" to the standard output, where `[a]` and `[b]` are the values of the parameters. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the printed output.
