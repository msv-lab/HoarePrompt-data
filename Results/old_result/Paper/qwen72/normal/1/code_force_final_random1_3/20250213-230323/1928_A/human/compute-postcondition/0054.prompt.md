You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            if a % 2 == 0:
                a1, a2 = a // 2, a // 2
                if a1 != b:
                    print('Yes')
                    continue
            if b % 2 == 0:
                b1, b2 = b // 2, b // 2
                if b1 != a:
                    print('Yes')
                    continue
            print('No')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is reduced by the number of iterations executed, and the values of `a` and `b` are determined by the input provided for each iteration. For each iteration, if `a` or `b` is even, `a1` and `b1` are set to half of `a` and `b` respectively (if they are even). The program prints 'Yes' if `a1` is not equal to `b` or `b1` is not equal to `a`, and 'No' otherwise. The loop continues until all `t` iterations are completed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). It returns the result of an operation or condition check involving `a` and `b` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
