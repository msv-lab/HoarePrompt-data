Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect due to several issues in the `func_1` function:

1. **Incorrect Replacement Logic**: The function attempts to replace characters in the string `s` with their symmetric counterparts from the `unique_chars` list. However, it does so in a way that modifies the string `s` while iterating over it, which can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

2. **Insertion of Characters**: The function incorrectly inserts characters into the `unique_chars` list, which is not part of the required algorithm. This step is unnecessary and disrupts the intended logic.

3. **Symmetric Replacement**: The function should create a mapping from each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric counterpart and then use this mapping to decode the string. The current implementation does not correctly handle this mapping.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    n = len(unique_chars)
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[n - 1 - i] for i in range(n)}
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        encoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(encoded_str)
```

This corrected version creates a mapping from each character in the sorted unique characters to its symmetric counterpart and then uses this mapping to decode the string. This approach ensures that the decoding process is correct and matches the problem requirements.
