### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Precomputation:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` set to 0.
   - It then iterates from 1 to 200000, calling `func_1(i)` for each `i` to get the sum of the digits of `i`.
   - The result of `func_1(i)` is added to `sum`, and the current value of `sum` is appended to the list `A`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `num` and calculates the sum of its digits.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of `num` using `num % 10` and add it to `a`.
   - It then updates `num` by removing the last digit using `int(num / 10)`.
   - The function returns the sum of the digits, which is stored in `a`.

3. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the precomputed sum of the digits from 1 to `n` by accessing `A[n - 1]`.

### Analysis:
- **Precomputation:** The program precomputes the sum of the sums of digits for all numbers from 1 to 200000 and stores them in the list `A`. This allows each test case to be answered in constant time by simply looking up the precomputed value.
- **Efficiency:** The precomputation step runs in O(n) time, where n is 200000. Each test case is then answered in O(1) time, which is efficient enough to meet the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.
- **Correctness of `func_1`:** The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number.
- **Correctness of Output:** The program correctly outputs the sum of the sums of digits for the given `n` by using the precomputed values in `A`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
