To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `x` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 1.
- `n` is the second integer from the input.
- `q` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- If `x` is divisible by `i`, and `(x - n * (x // i))` is non-negative and divisible by `(x // i)`, and `(x // i)` is greater than 0, then `ans` is set to `x`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.
   - The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

2. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.

3. **Check the Condition for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range specified by `range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1)`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `q` is 0, `i` is 2, and `i` must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, and `(x - n * (x // i))` is non-negative and divisible by `(x // i)`, and `(x // i)` is greater than 0, then `ans` is set to `x`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.**
