Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `a[3]` is set to `int(data[idx])`.** 

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented to 3, and the condition `n > 2` must still hold true for the loop to continue executing. The element at index 3 in the list `a` is updated to the integer value of `data[idx]`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
