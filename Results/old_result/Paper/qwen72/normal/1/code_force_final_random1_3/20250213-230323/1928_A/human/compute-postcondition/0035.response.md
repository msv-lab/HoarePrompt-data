Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. The function then checks the following conditions for each pair of `a` and `b`: 
- If both `a` and `b` are even, it prints 'yes'.
- If the conditions `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` are met, it prints 'no'.
- If the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, it prints 'yes'.
- Otherwise, it prints 'no'. 
After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the appropriate output ('yes' or 'no') has been printed for each test case. **
