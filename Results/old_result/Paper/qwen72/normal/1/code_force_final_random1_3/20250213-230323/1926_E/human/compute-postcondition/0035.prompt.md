Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values `[m1, m2, ..., mk]` where each `mi` is the value of `(ni + 1) // 2` for the corresponding iteration, and `ni` is the value of `n` at the start of each iteration, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
    tot += a
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values `[m1, m2, ..., mk]` where each `mi` is the value of `(ni + 1) // 2` for the corresponding iteration, and `ni` is the value of `n` at the start of each iteration, `tot` is `a`, `pow` is 2, `a` is the first element in `L`. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not hold, and no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values `[m1, m2, ..., mk]` where each `mi` is the value of `(ni + 1) // 2` for the corresponding iteration, and `ni` is the value of `n` at the start of each iteration, `tot` is `a + a`, `pow` is 4, `a` is the second element in `L`. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, then the postcondition remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values `[m1, m2, ..., mk]` where each `mi` is the value of `(ni + 1) // 2` for the corresponding iteration, and `ni` is the value of `n` at the start of each iteration, `tot` is `a + a + a`, `pow` is 8, `a` is the third element in `L`. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the postcondition remains as initially stated.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
