The value `v` is appended to the list `num`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `t` is 3, the conditions for setting `start` and updating `end` do not apply.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is a list containing `v`, `t` is 3, `v` is an input integer, `start` is -1 if `t` was 2 or remains as previously set if `t` was 1.**
