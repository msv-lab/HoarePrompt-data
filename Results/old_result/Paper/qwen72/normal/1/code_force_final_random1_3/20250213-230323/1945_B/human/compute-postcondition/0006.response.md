Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer input by the user, `b` is an integer input by the user, `m` is an integer input by the user, `mn` is the value of `min(a, b) + m`. Additionally, either `m % a` is not 0, or `m % b` is not 0, or `a` is 1, or `b` is 1.**
