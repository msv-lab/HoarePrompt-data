Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is a tuple (n, m) with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 and m being a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and the second element is a string a consisting of n characters from 'A' to 'G'.**
