Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(p1, p2, p3)` is the first tuple in the list, `resultats` is a list that may contain one element which is -1 if `total_points` is odd, otherwise `resultats` remains an empty list, and `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. If `total_points` is odd, the current iteration is skipped and the program moves to the next iteration of the loop.***
