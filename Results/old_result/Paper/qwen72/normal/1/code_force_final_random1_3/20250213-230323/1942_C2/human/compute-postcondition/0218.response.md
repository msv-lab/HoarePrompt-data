Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `y` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is `num - 1` for the original `num` in `a`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the updated `a`, `i` is 1, `t1` is `(a[1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the last element in `even`, `odd` is a sorted list containing all gaps greater than 1 and odd encountered during the loop, `even` is a sorted list containing all positive even gaps encountered during the loop. If `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, then `ans` is `x - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `x - 2`.***
