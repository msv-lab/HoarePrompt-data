To determine what will be printed by the `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculation:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- The condition \((4 * n - 2) \neq k\) is given, but it does not directly affect the value of `k`.

### Calculation:
- The expression inside the `print` statement is `ceil(k / 2)`.
- The `ceil` function from the `math` module rounds a number up to the nearest integer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Value of `k`**: The value of `k` is an input integer. Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we need to consider the general case.
2. **Expression `k / 2`**: This divides `k` by 2.
3. **Ceiling Function**: The `ceil` function will round the result of `k / 2` up to the nearest integer.

### Example Scenarios:
- If `k = 3`, then `k / 2 = 1.5` and `ceil(1.5) = 2`.
- If `k = 4`, then `k / 2 = 2.0` and `ceil(2.0) = 2`.
- If `k = 5`, then `k / 2 = 2.5` and `ceil(2.5) = 3`.

### General Case:
- For any integer `k`, the value of `ceil(k / 2)` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the ceiling of `k / 2`, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.

Output: **ceil(k / 2) (where ceil(k / 2) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k / 2)**
