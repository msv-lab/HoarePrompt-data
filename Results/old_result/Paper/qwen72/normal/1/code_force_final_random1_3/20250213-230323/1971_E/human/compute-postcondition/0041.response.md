To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations performed:

### Initial State:
- All variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `i`, `v`, `s`) retain their original values.
- `a[s] == ql` determines whether the current iteration of the loop is skipped.
- If `a[s] == ql`, the iteration is skipped.
- Otherwise, `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `m` is increased by `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Check if `a[s] == ql`:**
   - If `a[s] == ql`, the current iteration is skipped, and the `print` statement is not executed.
   - If `a[s] != ql`, proceed to the next steps.

2. **Update `ql`:**
   - `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.

3. **Update `m`:**
   - `m` is increased by the value `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.

4. **Print `int(m)`:**
   - The integer part of `m` is printed followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the operations, the `print` statement will output the integer part of `m` after it has been updated. Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `s`, and `ql` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **int(m) (where m is the updated value of m based on the given formula and conditions)**
