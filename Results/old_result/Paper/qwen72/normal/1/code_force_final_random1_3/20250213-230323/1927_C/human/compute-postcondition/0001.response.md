The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and `t` is used as the input to `range`, indicating that there are `t` test cases. After executing the code, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are determined by the input, while the value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.**
