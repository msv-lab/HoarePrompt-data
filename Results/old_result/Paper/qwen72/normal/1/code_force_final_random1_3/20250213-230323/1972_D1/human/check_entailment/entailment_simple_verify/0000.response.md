Reasoning: The original assessment is correct. The function `func_15` does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the implementation of `func_15` does not perform these checks. Instead, it calculates a sum involving the variable `i` in a way that is unrelated to the problem's requirements. The loop and the condition inside `func_15` do not reflect the necessary checks for the pairs (a, b) as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
