Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` and `b` are updated to positive integers provided by the input.
- `i` is 1.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('yes')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'yes'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **yes**
