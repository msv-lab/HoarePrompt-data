Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` remains the same, `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned new values from the input, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the input and must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the input and must have at least `len(a) + 1` elements, `ad` is now `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`, `bd` is now `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b)-1] - b[len(b)-2]]`, `i` is 2, `v` is now `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2]]`, all other variables (`l`, `m`, `s`, `ql`) retain their values as they were at the end of the previous iteration.**
