Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `l` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by 2, all other variables (`x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, `results`, `mp`, `pf`) remain unchanged.** 

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by 2, while the values of `_`, `l`, and `r` remain as they were initially set. All other variables (`x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, `results`, `mp`, `pf`) are not affected by this code snippet.
