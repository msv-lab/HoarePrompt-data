Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a tree structure with exactly two leaves, starting from an initial node specified by the user. It simulates a game where a stone moves through the tree's edges in two directions: forward and backward. The function determines the final position of the stone after one round of the game and prints 'Hermione' if the stone ends up in a position that corresponds to an even number of moves, and 'Ron' if the number of moves is odd. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **
