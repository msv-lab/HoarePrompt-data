The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `b`. The function then checks if it is possible to select `k/2` unique elements from both `a` and `b` such that each selected element appears in both lists. If this condition is met, the function prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, and the final state reflects the results of the last test case.
