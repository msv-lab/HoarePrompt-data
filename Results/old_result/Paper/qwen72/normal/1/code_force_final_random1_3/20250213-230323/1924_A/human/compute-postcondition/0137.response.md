The code snippet `ans += ss` appends the value of `ss` to the variable `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` starts as an empty string, and `ss` is derived from the ASCII value of the second character of the input string `s` minus 97 (the ASCII value of 'a'). 

Let's break down the impact of the code:

- `ans` is updated to include the value of `ss`.
- `ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97, which means `ss` is a number representing the position of the second character in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, and `cur_ss`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 2 characters, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is a string containing the value of `cur_ss`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97, `cur` is 0.**
