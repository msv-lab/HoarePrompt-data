Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `5 + n + 2 * q + 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `a[1]` set to `int(data[idx - 2])` and `a[2]` set to `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `pf[1]` set to `a[1]`, `mp` is a dictionary with either one key-value pair `{0: [0]}` or two key-value pairs `{0: [0], pf[1]: [1]}` depending on whether `pf[1]` is in `mp` or not, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional empty string at the end, `q` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 3]`, and `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `4 + n + 2 * q + 2` to `5 + n + 2 * q + 2`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
