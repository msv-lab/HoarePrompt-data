Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx_B` remains unchanged. If `len(idx_B) == 0`, `B` now contains one additional element which is 0. Otherwise, `B` now includes the value `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2)) * len(idx_B)`, and `x` is set to this new value in `B`.***
