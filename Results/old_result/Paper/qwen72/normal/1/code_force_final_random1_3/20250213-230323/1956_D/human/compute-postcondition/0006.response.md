To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is provided by the input and satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7.
- `s` is the first value returned by `func_2(a)`.
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2(a)`.
- `ops` is a non-empty list of pairs returned by `func_2(a)`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for (l, r) in ops:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the list `ops`, which is a list of pairs `(l, r)`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more pair in `ops`.

### Adjustments:
- The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is `ops`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `ops` must have at least one pair left for the loop to execute again.

### Conclusion:
- Since `ops` is a non-empty list of pairs, for the loop to execute one more time, `ops` must still contain at least one pair after the previous iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is provided by the input and satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7, `s` is the first value returned by `func_2(a)`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2(a)`, and `ops` is a non-empty list of pairs returned by `func_2(a)` with at least one pair remaining**.
