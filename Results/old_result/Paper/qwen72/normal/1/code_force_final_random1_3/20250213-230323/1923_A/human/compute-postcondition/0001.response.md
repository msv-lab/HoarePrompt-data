The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. Since `t` is an integer input by the user with the constraint 1 <= t <= 1000, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and it starts from 0 by default.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` should start from 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
