#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an even integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of columns in the grid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. The grid consists of two rows, each represented by a string of length n containing only the characters '<' and '>', indicating the direction of the arrows in each cell.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations without breaking early. `t` is 0, as all test cases have been processed. For each test case, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, and the loop has completed all iterations without breaking. The final value of `i` for each test case is `n-1` if `n` is odd, or `n-2` if `n` is even. The program prints 'yes' for each test case if it did not break out of the loop during any iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of columns in a grid, followed by two strings `a` and `b` of length `n`, each containing only the characters '<' and '>'. The function checks if there exists any pair of adjacent columns (i, i+1) such that either `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'`. If such a pair is found, the function prints 'No' and moves to the next test case. If no such pair is found for all columns, the function prints 'Yes'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that all test cases have been processed and the appropriate output ('Yes' or 'No') has been printed for each.
