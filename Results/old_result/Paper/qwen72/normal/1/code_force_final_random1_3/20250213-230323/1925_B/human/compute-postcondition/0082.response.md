To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `x` is the first integer from the new input.
   - `n` is the second integer from the new input.
   - `q` is 2.
   - `i` is calculated as \( \text{int}(\sqrt{x}) + 1 \).
   - `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` such that \( x - n \cdot i \geq 0 \) and \( (x - n \cdot i) \% i == 0 \).

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `x` and `n` are inputs, so their exact values are not specified but are known when the code runs.
   - `i` is derived from `x` as \( \text{int}(\sqrt{x}) + 1 \). This means `i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `x`.
   - `ans` is determined by finding the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the conditions \( x - n \cdot i \geq 0 \) and \( (x - n \cdot i) \% i == 0 \).

3. **Finding `ans`:**
   - To find `ans`, we need to check all divisors of `x` starting from the largest and moving downwards.
   - For each divisor `d` of `x`, we check if \( x - n \cdot i \geq 0 \) and \( (x - n \cdot i) \% i == 0 \).
   - The first divisor that meets these conditions is assigned to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since the exact values of `x` and `n` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`.
   - However, based on the conditions, `ans` will be the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the given constraints.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `ans` as described by the conditions in the initial state.

Output: **ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x such that x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0 for some divisor i of x)**
