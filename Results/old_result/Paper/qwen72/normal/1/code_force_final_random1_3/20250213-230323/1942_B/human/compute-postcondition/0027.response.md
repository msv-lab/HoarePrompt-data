Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None` except for the last element which is `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `mex` is now equal to `n`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, and the condition `(mex > mex - ar[i])` holds true, meaning `ar[i]` is a positive integer.**
