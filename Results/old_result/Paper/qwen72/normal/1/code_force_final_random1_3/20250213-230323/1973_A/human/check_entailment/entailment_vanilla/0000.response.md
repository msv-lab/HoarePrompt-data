### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the final scores of three players.
   - The scores are given as \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
   - Each game can either end in a win/loss (2 points for the winner, 0 for the loser) or a draw (1 point for each player).

2. **Total Points Calculation:**
   - The total points scored by all players must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (win/loss) or 2 points (draw).
   - If the total points are odd, it's impossible to achieve the scores, so we return -1.

3. **Total Matches Calculation:**
   - The total number of matches played is half the total points because each match contributes 2 points.
   - If the total number of matches exceeds 3 (since there are only 3 players and each pair can play multiple times), or if the highest score \( p_3 \) is greater than the total number of matches, it's impossible to achieve the scores, so we return -1.

4. **Calculating Draws:**
   - The formula used to calculate the number of draws is derived from the fact that each draw contributes 2 points to the total points.
   - The number of draws is calculated as \( \text{total\_points} - 2 \times (p3 - p2) - 2 \times (p3 - p1) \).
   - This formula accounts for the points contributed by wins and losses, and the remaining points should be due to draws.
   - If the number of draws is negative, it means the scores are not achievable, so we return -1.

5. **Checking the Code:**
   - The code correctly checks if the total points are even.
   - It calculates the total number of matches and checks if it's feasible.
   - It calculates the number of draws using the derived formula and ensures it's non-negative.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or returns -1 if the scores are not achievable. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
