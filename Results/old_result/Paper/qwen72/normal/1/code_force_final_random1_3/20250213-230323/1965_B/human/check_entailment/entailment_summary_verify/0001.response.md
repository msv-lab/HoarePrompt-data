Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `func_10()` to read the number of test cases and `func_7()` to read the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. These functions are designed to handle input efficiently using `sys.stdin.buffer`. This part is correct and efficient.

2. **Base Case Handling**:
   - If `k == 1`, the program handles it separately. For `n == 2`, it returns `1\n2`. For other values of `n`, it initializes the sequence with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - This ensures that there is no subsequence summing to 1, and all other values from 1 to `n` can be formed. However, the sequence `[2, 3]` might not be sufficient for larger `n` values. For example, if `n = 5`, the sequence `[2, 3]` cannot form the value 4. Therefore, the base case handling needs to be more robust.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - For `k > 1`, the program constructs the sequence by appending powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k-1`.
   - It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum of the sequence does not include `k`.
   - It also appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to cover additional values.
   - Finally, it appends powers of 2 from the length of `k` to the length of `n`.
   - This approach is intended to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other values from 1 to `n` to be formed. However, the logic for constructing the sequence is not entirely clear and may not cover all edge cases.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed sequence for each test case. The output format is correct and matches the problem requirements.

5. **Constraints**:
   - The sequence size is limited to 25, which is within the problem's constraints.
   - The values in the sequence are non-negative and do not exceed \(10^9\).

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the base case and general case in terms of the output format and constraints.
   - However, the sequence construction logic for the base case and general case needs to be more robust to ensure that all values from 1 to `n` can be formed by subsequences while avoiding the sum `k`.

Given the above reasoning, the program has some logical issues in the sequence construction, particularly in the base case handling and ensuring that all values from 1 to `n` can be formed. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

Final: **False**
