Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `bOnes` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, or `aOnes`. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition of `bOnes` being set to 0.
