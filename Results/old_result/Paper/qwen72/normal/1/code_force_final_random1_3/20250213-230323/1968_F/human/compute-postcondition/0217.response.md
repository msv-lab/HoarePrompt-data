The code snippet increments the value of `idx` by 2. This affects the value of `idx` but does not change the values of any other variables mentioned in the initial state. The conditions and values of `it1`, `it2`, `v1`, `v2`, `l`, `r`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `it1` is the index in `v1` such that `v1[it1]` is the first element in `v1` that is greater than or equal to the new value of `l`, and `it2` is the index in `v2` such that `v2[it2]` is the last element in `v2` that is less than the new value of `r`. If `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, `v1[it1]` is less than or equal to `r`, and `v2[it2]` is greater than or equal to the new value of `l`, then the list `results` contains the string 'YES'. Otherwise, either `it1` is equal to or greater than the length of `v1`, or `it2` is less than 0, or `v1[it1]` is greater than `r`, or `v2[it2]` is less than the new value of `l`, and the list `results` contains the string 'NO'. `l` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, and `r` is now the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`. `idx` is incremented by 2.**
