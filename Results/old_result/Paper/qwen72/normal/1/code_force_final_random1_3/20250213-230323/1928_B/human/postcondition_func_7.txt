The function `func_8` takes a list `arr` of positive integers as input and returns a new list `ans`. Each element in `ans` represents the cumulative product of the elements from the start of `arr` up to the current position. Specifically, the first element of `ans` is the first element of `arr`, the second element of `ans` is the product of the first two elements of `arr`, and so on, until the last element of `ans` which is the product of all elements in `arr`. The original list `arr` remains unchanged.
