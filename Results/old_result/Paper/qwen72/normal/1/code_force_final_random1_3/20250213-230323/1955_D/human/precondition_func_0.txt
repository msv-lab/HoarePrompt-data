t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; b is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
