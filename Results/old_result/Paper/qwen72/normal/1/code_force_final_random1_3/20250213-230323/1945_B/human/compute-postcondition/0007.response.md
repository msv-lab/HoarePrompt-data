To determine what will be printed by the `print(mn // a + mn // b)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is an integer input by the user.
   - `b` is an integer input by the user.
   - `m` is an integer input by the user.
   - `mn` is the value of `min(a, b) + m`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - Either `m % a` is not 0, or `m % b` is not 0, or `a` is 1, or `b` is 1.

3. **Computation:**
   - `mn` is calculated as `min(a, b) + m`.
   - The expression `mn // a + mn // b` is evaluated.

Let's analyze the expression `mn // a + mn // b`:

- `mn` is `min(a, b) + m`.
- `mn // a` is the integer division of `mn` by `a`.
- `mn // b` is the integer division of `mn` by `b`.

Given the conditions, we need to consider the possible values of `a`, `b`, and `m`:

- If `a` or `b` is 1, then `mn // a` or `mn // b` will be `mn` because any number divided by 1 is itself.
- If `m % a` is not 0 or `m % b` is not 0, it means `m` is not divisible by `a` or `b`, but this does not affect the integer division directly.

Let's summarize the possible scenarios:

1. **If `a` is 1:**
   - `mn // a` is `mn`.
   - `mn // b` is `mn // b`.
   - The result is `mn + mn // b`.

2. **If `b` is 1:**
   - `mn // a` is `mn // a`.
   - `mn // b` is `mn`.
   - The result is `mn // a + mn`.

3. **If neither `a` nor `b` is 1:**
   - `mn // a` is `mn // a`.
   - `mn // b` is `mn // b`.
   - The result is `mn // a + mn // b`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **mn // a + mn // b (where mn is min(a, b) + m, a and b are the input integers, and m is the input integer)**
