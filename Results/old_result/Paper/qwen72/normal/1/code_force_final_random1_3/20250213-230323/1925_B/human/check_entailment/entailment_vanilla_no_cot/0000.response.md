Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It iterates through potential divisors of \(x\) up to its square root to efficiently find the greatest common divisor (GCD) that can be used to divide \(x\) into \(n\) parts, ensuring the maximum balance of the problem set. The logic checks both the divisor and the quotient to ensure they meet the conditions for forming a valid set of sub-problems. This approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and correct for the given constraints.
