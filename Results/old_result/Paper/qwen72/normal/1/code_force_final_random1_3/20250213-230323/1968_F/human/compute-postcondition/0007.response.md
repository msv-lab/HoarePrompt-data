Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, each test case consists of two integers n and q where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, the array a contains n integers a_1, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, each query is represented by two integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases and the sum of q over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns the integer value of `data[2]` to `q`.
- The value of `q` is now the integer value of the second element in the `data` list (since `idx` is 1, `idx + 1` is 2).
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
