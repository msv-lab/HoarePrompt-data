Output State: **The program does not return any value. The final state is as follows: `nums[0]` is decreased by 1, if `start` is 1 then `nums[1]` is decreased by 2, and if `start` is 2 then `nums[2]` is decreased by 2. The set `vis` contains the elements 0, 1, and 1, but since sets cannot contain duplicate elements, it effectively contains 0 and 1.**
