Postcondition: ***`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `b` is a new list of integers converted from the new input string, `i` is the index up to which `a` and `b` have matching elements or the length of `a` (whichever is smaller). If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, `new` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` where each element `new[j]` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and `new2` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` where each element `new2[j]` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`. If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` where each element `new[j]` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`, and `new2` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` where each element `new2[j]` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`.***
