Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. The key insight here is understanding how many cells need to be colored to cover the required number of diagonals.

1. **Understanding Diagonals**: In an \( n \times n \) grid, there are \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right and another \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left, making a total of \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals.

2. **Special Case Handling**: If \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 2 \), it means we need to cover all diagonals. In this case, the program correctly outputs \( k // 2 + 1 \). This is because covering all diagonals requires at least \( 2n - 1 \) cells (one for each diagonal), and since \( k = 4n - 2 \), \( k // 2 + 1 \) simplifies to \( 2n - 1 \).

3. **General Case**: For other values of \( k \), the program uses \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) to determine the minimum number of cells needed. This is because each cell can cover up to 2 diagonals (one from each direction), so \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) ensures that at least \( k \) diagonals are covered.

4. **Input and Output Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading \( n \) and \( k \), then applying the logic to compute and print the result.

Given the above points, the program appears to handle both the special and general cases correctly and follows the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
