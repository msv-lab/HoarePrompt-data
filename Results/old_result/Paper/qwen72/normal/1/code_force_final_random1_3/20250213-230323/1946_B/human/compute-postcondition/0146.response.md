Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains the same, `i` is `n`, `smin` is updated as required, `b`, `k`, `j`, `t`, and `smin[0]` remain `[0]`. `sm` is the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `0` to `n` inclusive.
- **`smin`**: This array is updated according to the rule specified in the problem statement. For each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, if `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin[i + 1]` is set to `suf[i + 1]`; otherwise, `smin[i + 1]` is set to `smin[i]`.
- **`b`, `k`, `j`, `t`, and `smin[0]`**: These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`sm`**: This variable is updated to the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n`. Initially, `sm` is set to `-111`, and it is updated whenever `suf[i] - smin[i]` is greater than the current value of `sm`. By the end of the loop, `sm` will hold the maximum difference found.
