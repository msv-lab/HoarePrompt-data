Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an input integer - 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is an input integer - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`, `best` is updated based on the comparison between `best` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `v` is `na_frente - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, where `v` is `na_frente - 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions.
- The specific value of `total` after the update is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`.
- The value of `best` is still updated based on the comparison between `best` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, but this part of the logic is not directly affected by the given code snippet.
