The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer, assigning these integers to `n` and `m` respectively.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**
