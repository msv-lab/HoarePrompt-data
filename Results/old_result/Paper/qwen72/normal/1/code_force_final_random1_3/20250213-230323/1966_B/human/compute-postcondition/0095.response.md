The code snippet `gr.append(input())` adds a new element to the list `gr`. This new element is the result of the `input()` function, which reads a line from input, converts it to a string, and appends it to the list `gr`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing two input strings, `i` is `n`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is `False`**.
