The only object in the loop head is the list `custos`, and the variable `c` which represents the current element being iterated over. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in the list `custos` to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `custos` is a list containing at least two elements. For the loop to execute again, `custos` must contain at least three elements, and `c` will be the third element in the list.

State: **`custos` is a list containing at least three elements, `c` is the third element in the list**
