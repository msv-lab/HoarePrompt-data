The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list located at index `u` in the list `u2vs`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to `n`
- The list at index `u-1` contains the value `v` twice
- The list at index `v-1` in `u2vs` now includes the value `u-1` three times
- `u` is the integer provided as input minus 1
- `v` is the integer provided as input minus 1

After executing the code:
- The list at index `u` in `u2vs` will now contain one additional `v`, making it appear three times in the list at index `u`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to `n`, the list at index `u-1` contains the value `v` three times, the list at index `v-1` in `u2vs` now includes the value `u-1` three times, `u` is the integer provided as input minus 1, `v` is the integer provided as input minus 1.**
