Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `b` is a new list of integers converted from the new input string, `i` is 0, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` which is now `max(a[0], b[0])`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`, and `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`.**
