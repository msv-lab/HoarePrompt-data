The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of the character '1' in the string `b` to the list `k`. Since `b` is a user input string that contains the character '1', the value appended to `k` will be a positive integer representing the number of times '1' appears in `b`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `k` is a list containing the number of '1's in `b`, `i` is 2, `a` is greater than 2, `b` is the user input string, and the string `b` contains the character '1'.**
