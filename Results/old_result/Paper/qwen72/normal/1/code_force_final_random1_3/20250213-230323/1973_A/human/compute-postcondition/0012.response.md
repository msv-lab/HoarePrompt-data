Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(p1, p2, p3)` is the first tuple in the list, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing the value -1, and the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.**

Explanation:
- The code calculates the value of `egalites` using the formula `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
- All other conditions and variable values from the initial state remain unchanged.
- The value of `egalites` is now part of the output state.
