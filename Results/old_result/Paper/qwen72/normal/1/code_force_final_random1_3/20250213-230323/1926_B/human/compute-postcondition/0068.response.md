Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a grid of `n` x `n` characters ('0' or '1'). It then determines and prints whether the shape formed by the '1's in the grid is a 'SQUARE' or a 'TRIANGLE'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the program state is such that all input has been processed and the appropriate shape for each test case has been printed. The original values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the grid retains its initial configuration. **
