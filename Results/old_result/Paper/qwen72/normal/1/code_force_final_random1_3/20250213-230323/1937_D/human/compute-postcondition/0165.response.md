The value of `b` is updated to `b - B[x]`. Since `b` was initially set to `B[r - 1]`, the new value of `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **The only variable that changes is `x`. All other variables remain unchanged. `b` is now equal to `B[r - 1] - B[x]`.**
