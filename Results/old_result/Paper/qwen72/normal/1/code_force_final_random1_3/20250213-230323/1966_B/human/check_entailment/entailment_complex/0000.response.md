Reasoning:  
The function `func` aims to solve the problem by checking if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color through the allowed operations. The logic in the function is as follows:

1. **Initial Setup**: It reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. **Grid Reading**: For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid and then reads the grid itself into a list of strings `gr`.
3. **Initial Assumption**: It assumes that it is possible to make all squares the same color (`ans = 'YES'`).
4. **Corner Check**: It checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) are different colors. If they are different, it proceeds to check if the entire row and column are consistent in color.
   - **Row Consistency Check**: It checks if there is any inconsistency in the first and last rows.
   - **Column Consistency Check**: It checks if there is any inconsistency in the first and last columns.
5. **Final Decision**: If both the row and column consistency checks pass (i.e., no inconsistencies found), it sets `ans` to 'NO'. Otherwise, it keeps `ans` as 'YES'.
6. **Output**: It prints the result for each test case.

However, there is a logical flaw in the function. The function incorrectly assumes that if the corners are different and the rows and columns are consistent, it should always print 'NO'. This is not necessarily true. For example, consider a grid where the top-left and bottom-right corners are different, but the rest of the grid is consistent in color. In such a case, it might still be possible to make the entire grid the same color by selecting appropriate subrectangles.

To fix this, the function should only set `ans` to 'NO' if there is a clear inconsistency that makes it impossible to unify the grid, such as having different colors in the corners and inconsistent rows or columns.

Given the current implementation, the function will fail for certain edge cases where the grid can be unified despite the corners being different.

Correctness: **False**
