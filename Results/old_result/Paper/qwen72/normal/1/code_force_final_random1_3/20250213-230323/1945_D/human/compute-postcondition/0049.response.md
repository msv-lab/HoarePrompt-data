The provided code snippet updates the values of `na_frente` and `pos_final` by reading two integers from the input and assigning them to these variables. Here's the updated state:

- `na_frente` is now the first integer read from the input minus 1.
- `pos_final` is now the second integer read from the input minus 1.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first input integer - 1, `pos_final` is the second input integer - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) for each iteration from `na_frente` down to 0, and `best` is the lowest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` where `v <= pos_final`.**
