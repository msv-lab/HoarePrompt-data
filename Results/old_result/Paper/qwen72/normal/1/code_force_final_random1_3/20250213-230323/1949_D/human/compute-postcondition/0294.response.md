Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 24) and `n` lines of input, each containing `n` characters representing transitions between scenarios. These characters can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (no transition). The function processes these inputs to categorize scenarios into those that are only funny (`sa`) and those that are only scary (`sb`). It then modifies the undecided transitions ('?') based on the following rules: If the number of funny scenarios is greater than or equal to the number of scary scenarios, it replaces the first `n // 4` undecided transitions with 'F' and the rest with 'S'. If the number of scary scenarios is greater, it replaces the first `n // 4` undecided transitions with 'S' and the rest with 'F'. The function prints the modified transition matrix, one line at a time. The original input and internal state of the function remain unchanged. **
