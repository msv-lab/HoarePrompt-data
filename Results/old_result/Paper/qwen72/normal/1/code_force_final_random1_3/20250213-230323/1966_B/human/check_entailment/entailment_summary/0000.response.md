Reasoning:

The provided solution aims to determine if it's possible to make all squares in an \(n \times m\) grid the same color through a series of operations, as described in the problem statement. The key logic in the solution is to check if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid are the same color. If they are different, it then checks if all rows and columns have consistent colors except possibly the corners. If these conditions are met, the function prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

However, there are some issues with this approach:

1. **Corner Case Handling**: The solution only checks the consistency of colors along the edges (first and last row, first and last column) when the corners are different. This is insufficient because it doesn't consider the possibility that the entire grid might still be transformable even if the corners are different. For example, a grid like:
   ```
   W B W
   B W B
   W B W
   ```
   has different corners but can still be transformed into a uniform color.

2. **General Case**: The solution should consider the possibility of transforming the grid by selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring the subrectangle between them. The current implementation only checks the edges and corners, which is not comprehensive enough.

3. **Simpler Solution**: A simpler and more correct approach would be to check if there is at least one 'W' and one 'B' in the grid. If both colors are present, it is always possible to make the entire grid one color by selecting appropriate pairs of squares. If only one color is present, the grid is already uniform, and no operations are needed.

Given these points, the provided solution is not correct for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
