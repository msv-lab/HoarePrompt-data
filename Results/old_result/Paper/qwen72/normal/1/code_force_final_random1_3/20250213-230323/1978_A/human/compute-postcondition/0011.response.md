The code snippet `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `nums`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`
- `n` is an input integer

After executing the code snippet, the following changes occur:
- A new list `nums` is created, which contains the integers converted from the input.

The values of `_`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers from the input.**
