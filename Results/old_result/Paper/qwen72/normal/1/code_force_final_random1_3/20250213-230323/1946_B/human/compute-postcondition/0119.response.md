To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. This is because the `range(n)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `n`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
- The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0.

Given the initial state:
- `n` remains the same after all iterations, implying `n` is already defined and should be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- `i` is `n - 1` after the last iteration, but this is not relevant to the initial state before the loop starts.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` will be initialized by the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
