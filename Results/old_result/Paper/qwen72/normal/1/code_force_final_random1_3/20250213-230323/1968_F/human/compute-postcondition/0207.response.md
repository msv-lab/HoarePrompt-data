Output State: **`it1` is the index in `v1` such that `v1[it1]` is the first element in `v1` that is greater than or equal to `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The line `it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)` uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the position in the sorted list `v1` where `l` would fit to maintain the order. This position is stored in `it1`.
- `v1` is a list of indices from the dictionary `mp` corresponding to the value `pf[r]`.
- `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`.
- `it1` is the index in `v1` such that `v1[it1]` is the first element in `v1` that is greater than or equal to `l`.
- All other variables (`t`, `data`, `idx`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `results`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`) remain unchanged.
