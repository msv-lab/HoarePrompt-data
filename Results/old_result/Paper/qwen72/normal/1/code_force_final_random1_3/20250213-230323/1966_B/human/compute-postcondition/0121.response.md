The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, `i` becomes 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is 1, `j` is `m - 2`, the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `ans` is 'NO'. For all `j` from 0 to `m - 2`, `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`. If `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.**
