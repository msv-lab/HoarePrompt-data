The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18) and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) from the user input. It then calls another function `func_2` with the list `a` and prints the first two values returned by `func_2`. Additionally, it iterates over a list of pairs returned by `func_2` and prints each pair with their indices incremented by 1. After the function concludes, the input variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and the output consists of the values and pairs printed to the console.
