Output State: **`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer, and `power` is equal to `n`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to increment `power` by 1 until `power` is no longer less than `n`.
- After the loop completes, `power` will be equal to `n`.
- The values of `i` and `n_cases` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
- The condition `n` being the base-2 logarithm of the input integer remains true throughout the loop execution.
