Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is an input string.
- `i` is 1.
- The condition `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<') or (a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` must hold true.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('No')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **No**
