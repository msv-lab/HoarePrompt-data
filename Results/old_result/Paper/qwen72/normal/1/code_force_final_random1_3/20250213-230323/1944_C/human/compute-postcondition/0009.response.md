Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5). `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `nums[0]` is now `nums[0] - 1`. `start` is 0. `vis` is a set containing the element 0. Additionally, `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is 0, meaning that the integer `start + 1` (which is 1) does not exist in the `nums` Counter object.**
