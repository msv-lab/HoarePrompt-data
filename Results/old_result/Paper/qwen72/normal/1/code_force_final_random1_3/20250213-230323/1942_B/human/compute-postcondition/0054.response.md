To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `_` is 2 (This variable is not used in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 (This variable is not used in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `n` is an input integer (This variable is not used in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `ar` is a list of integers derived from the user input and must have at least 1 element (This variable is used in the loop head, so it may be relevant).
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where `res[0]` is now `mex - ar[0]` (This variable is not used in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `mex` is `n - ar[-1]` if `ar[-1] > 0`, and `i` is 0. If `mex > mex - ar[0]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[-1] - ar[0]` if `ar[-1] > 0` (This variable is not used in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- The loop statement is:
  ```python
  for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
      # the loop body is omit
  ```

### Loop Head Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the list `ar` in reverse order, starting from `len(ar) - 1` and ending at `0`.
- The loop variable `i` is adjusted by the loop itself.

### Current State:
- `i` is 0 (This is the loop variable and will be adjusted by the loop).

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- The loop will decrement `i` by 1 in each iteration.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Current State**: `i` is 0.
2. **Next Iteration**: The loop will decrement `i` by 1, so `i` will be -1.
3. **Condition for Execution**: The loop will stop when `i` is -1 because the loop condition is `i >= 0`.

Since `i` is already 0 and the loop will decrement it to -1, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, no further adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers derived from the user input and must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where `res[0]` is now `mex - ar[0]`, `mex` is `n - ar[-1]` if `ar[-1] > 0`, and `i` is -1**.
