Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is 4, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, each test case consists of two integers `n` and `q` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, the array `a` contains `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0 except `a[1]` which is now `int(data[3])`, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, the sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `results` is an empty list, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is `int(data[3])` and the value is an empty list, `i` is 1, `pf[1]` is `int(data[3])`. If `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp` is updated to include `pf[i]` as a key with an empty list as its value.***
