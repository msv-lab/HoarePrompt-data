Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 1, `s` is a new input binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `j` is `len(s) - 1`, `count` is the number of adjacent character pairs in `s` that are different, and `flag` is True because there is at least one occurrence of '0' followed immediately by '1' in `s`.**
