You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

import sys
import bisect

input = sys.stdin.read

    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases, each containing an array of integers and a set of queries. It reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases, the size of the array, the array itself, and the queries. For each query, it determines whether the XOR of the elements in the specified subarray is zero or if there exists a pair of indices within the subarray that have the same prefix XOR value. The function outputs 'YES' if either condition is met, otherwise 'NO'. The output for each test case is followed by an empty line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It iterates through the list to parse the number of test cases, the size of the array, the number of queries, and the elements of the array and queries.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - It also maintains a dictionary `mp` to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using the prefix XOR array.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is zero, it means the subarray is interesting, and the program appends 'YES' to the results.
   - If the XOR is not zero, it checks if there exist indices `i` and `j` such that `pf[i] == pf[r]` and `pf[j] == pf[l-1]` and `l <= i <= r` and `l <= j <= r`. This is done using binary search with the `bisect` module.
   - If such indices exist, the subarray is interesting, and the program appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all queries for all test cases, the program prints the results.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly parses the input and processes each test case and query.
- The logic for determining if a subarray is interesting is sound and follows the problem's requirements.
- The use of prefix XOR and binary search ensures efficient query processing.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
