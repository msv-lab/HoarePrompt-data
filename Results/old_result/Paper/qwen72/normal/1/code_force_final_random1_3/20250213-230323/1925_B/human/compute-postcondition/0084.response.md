The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `n`. The parameter `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 10^8, and `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `t`, `x`, and `n`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, and `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not specified.**
