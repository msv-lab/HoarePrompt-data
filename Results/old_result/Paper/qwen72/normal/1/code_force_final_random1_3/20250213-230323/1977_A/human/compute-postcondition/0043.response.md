The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- **Initial State**: 
  - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 2.
  - `i` is 2.
  - `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
  - The parity (even or odd) of `n` and `m` is determined by the input values.

- **Code Execution**:
  - The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`) or their values. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

### Output:
Output: **Yes**
