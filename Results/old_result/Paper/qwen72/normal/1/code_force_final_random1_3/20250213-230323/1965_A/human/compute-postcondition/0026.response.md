Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive; `A` is `False` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise it is `True`; `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr`, including the number 1; `not_c` is `True` if no two consecutive elements in `set_` have a difference greater than 1. If `not_c` is `True`, then `A` is `False` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `A` is `True`.***
