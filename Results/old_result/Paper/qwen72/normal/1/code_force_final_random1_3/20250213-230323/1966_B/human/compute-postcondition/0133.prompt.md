Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500), representing the dimensions of the grid, followed by n lines each containing m characters ('W' or 'B'), representing the initial colors of the grid. The total number of cells across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    gr = []
    for i in range(n):
        gr.append(input())
    ans = 'YES'
    if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
        impossible = True
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                impossible = False
        if impossible:
            ans = 'NO'
        impossible = True
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                impossible = False
        if impossible:
            ans = 'NO'
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, and `ans` is 'YES'. If `gr[0][0]` is different from `gr[n-1][m-1]`, then `j` is `m-2`, `ans` is 'NO', and if `impossible` is `True`, the program maintains all these conditions. If `impossible` is `False`, the program also maintains all these conditions, but `impossible` is `False`, indicating that at least one pair of consecutive strings in `gr` has a different first character or a different last character. If `gr[0][0]` is the same as `gr[n-1][m-1]`, then the program maintains the original conditions with `ans` still being 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is `False`. If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, and if `impossible` is `True` (because at least one pair of consecutive strings in `gr` has different first or last characters), `ans` is set to 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is `False`. If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, `ans` is 'NO', for all `j` from 0 to `m - 2`, `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`. If any `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]` for `i` from 0 to `n - 2`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` is `True`. If `impossible` is `True`, the program does not change any variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
