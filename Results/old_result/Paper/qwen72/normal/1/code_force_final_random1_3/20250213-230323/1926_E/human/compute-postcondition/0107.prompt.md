Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value provided by the user input, 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    L = []
    while n:
        m = (n + 1) // 2
        n -= m
        L.append(m)
    tot = 0
    pow = 1
    for a in L:
        if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
            print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
        tot += a
        pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values `[m1, m2, ..., mk]` where each `mi` is the value of `(ni + 1) // 2` for the corresponding iteration, and `ni` is the value of `n` at the start of each iteration, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, `pow` is \(2^{\text{length of } L}\), `a` is the last element in `L`. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the condition holds true and the output is `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`. Otherwise, the condition does not hold, and no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is `k_input`, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values generated by repeatedly dividing `n_input` by 2 and taking the integer part until `n` becomes 0, `a` is the last element in `L`, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, `pow` is 2 raised to the power of the number of elements in `L`. The condition that `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a` is either met or not met for each iteration, and the corresponding output is printed if the condition is met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `L` is a list containing the values `(n_initial + 1) // 2`, `((n_initial // 2 + 1) // 2)`, ..., until `n` becomes 0, `a` is the last element in `L`, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, `pow` is \(2^{\text{length of } L}\), and `m` is the last value calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
