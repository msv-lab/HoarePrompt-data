Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` is the percentage of '0's in the processed part of `s`, `one_perc` is the percentage of '1's in the remaining part of `s`, `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%, `mini` is the minimum of its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, and `z` remain unchanged, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements `elem` from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, and the length of `final` is 0. Additionally, `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.**
