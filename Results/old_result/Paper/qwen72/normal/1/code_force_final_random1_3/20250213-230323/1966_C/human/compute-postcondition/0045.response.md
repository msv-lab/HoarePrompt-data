Output State: **`tc` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `dp` is `True` if any difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is 0) is greater than 1, otherwise `dp` is `False`.**

### Explanation:
- **`tc`**: After all iterations of the loop, `tc` will be 0 because the loop decrements `tc` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.
- **`t`**: The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: For each test case, `n` is the length of the list `arr` minus 1. This value is determined during each iteration based on the input and remains valid for the current test case.
- **`arr`**: `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0. This list is constructed for each test case and remains valid for the current test case.
- **`i`**: The variable `i` is set to `n - 1` at the end of the inner loop, which processes the elements of `arr`.
- **`dp`**: The variable `dp` is updated based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp` for each pair of consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is 0). If any difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1, `dp` will be `True`; otherwise, it will be `False`.

This output state reflects the final conditions of the variables after all iterations of the loop have completed.
