The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop's execution depends on the value of `int(input())`. Since `_` is incremented by 1 with each iteration, and the loop condition is based on the value provided by `int(input())`, we need to adjust `_` and ensure that the value of `int(input())` is greater than the current value of `_`.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. After the increment, `_` becomes 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`. The value of `int(input())` must be greater than 1.**
