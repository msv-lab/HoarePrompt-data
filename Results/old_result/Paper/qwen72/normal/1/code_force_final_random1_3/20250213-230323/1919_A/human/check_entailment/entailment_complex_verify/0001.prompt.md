You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Bob'
        #The program returns the string 'Bob'.
    else :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns the string 'Alice'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where 1 <= a, b <= 10^9). It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If the sum is even, it returns the string 'Bob'. If the sum is odd, it returns the string 'Alice'. After the function concludes, it will have returned either 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())
        
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        
        results.append(winner)
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is a throwaway variable, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and they are set to the input values for the last iteration, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `results` is a list containing all the results from `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration, and the loop has printed each result in `results` exactly once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `a` and `b` (where `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`), and calls another function `func_1(a, b)` to determine a winner. The results of these calls are stored in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, the function prints each result in `results` exactly once. The final state of the program is that `results` contains the outcomes of `func_1(a, b)` for each test case, and these outcomes have been printed to the console.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game where they can either swap wallets or keep their own, and then remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin from a non-empty wallet) loses.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game is symmetric, and the total number of coins (a + b) plays a crucial role in determining the winner.
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always win because he can mirror Alice's moves. This is because after each pair of moves (one by Alice and one by Bob), the total number of coins decreases by 2, and the parity (even or odd) remains the same.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win because she can force Bob into a position where he cannot make a valid move.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1(a, b):**
     - This function checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
     - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
     - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
     - This logic is correct based on the key insight above.

   - **func_2():**
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner, and appends the result to a list.
     - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.
     - This function correctly handles multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to determine the winner for each case.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Both functions are implemented correctly and follow the logic required to solve the problem.
   - The solution correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.
