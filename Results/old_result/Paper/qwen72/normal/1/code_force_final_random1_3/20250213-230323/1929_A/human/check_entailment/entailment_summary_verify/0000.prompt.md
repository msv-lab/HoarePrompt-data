You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it sorts the list `a` and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted list. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The state of the program remains unchanged except for the printed output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program sorts the array and then prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements (`a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`). However, this approach does not account for the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
3
2 1 3
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output from the provided program:
```
2
```

While this specific test case might seem to work, the program fails for other cases. For example:

Input:
```
1
4
3 4 3 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Actual Output from the provided program:
```
1
```

However, the program's logic is fundamentally flawed because it does not compute the sum of the differences as required. A correct approach would involve sorting the array and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting.

A correct implementation would look something like this:

```python
def max_beauty():
    ntest = int(input())
    for _ in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        beauty = sum(a[i] - a[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)
```

This implementation correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by summing the differences between consecutive elements after sorting the array.
