The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 200,000, and `k` is a non-negative integer within the range 0 to 1,000,000,000,000. The function has multiple return cases based on the values of `n` and `k`:

- **Case_1**: If certain conditions are met, the function returns a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- **Case_2**: If other conditions are met, the function returns the result of calling `func_2` with `c` set to 1, `k` set to `k // 2`, and `l` set to a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- **Case_3**: If specific conditions are satisfied, the function returns the result of `func_3(c, l)` where `c` is 2 and `l` is the initial value of `l`.
- **Case_4**: If certain conditions are true, the function returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)` where `c` is 2, `k` is `k // 2 - (n - 2) + 1`, and `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)` with `c` being 2 and `l` being the initial value of `l`. If `k` is 0, the function returns the result of `func_3(c, l)` where `c` is 2 and `l` is the initial value of `l`.
- **Case_5**: If a particular condition is met, the function returns the result of `func_3(2, l)`.
- **Case_6**: If the final set of conditions is true, the function returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`, where `c` is the value of `c` increased by 1, `k` is the value of `k` after being updated to `k - (n - 2) + 1` and is greater than or equal to `(n - 2) - 1`, and `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`.

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, and `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000. Depending on the values of `n` and `k`, the function returns different results: a list of integers from 1 to `n`, the result of calling `func_2` or `func_3` with specific arguments, or the result of updating and calling `func_2` or `func_3` with modified arguments.**
