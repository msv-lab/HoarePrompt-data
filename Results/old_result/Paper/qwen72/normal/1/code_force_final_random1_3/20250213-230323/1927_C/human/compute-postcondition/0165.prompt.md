Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), and k is even; a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; b is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    aOnes = 0
    bOnes = 0
    newk = k // 2
    i = 1
    while i <= k:
        if i in a and i in b:
            if aOnes < bOnes:
                aOnes += 1
            else:
                bOnes += 1
        elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
            aOnes += 1
        elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
            bOnes += 1
        else:
            break
        i += 1
    if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b` and meet the condition `aOnes < bOnes` up to `newk`, `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are also in `a` and meet the condition `bOnes < aOnes` up to `newk`. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is `t + 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `b` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b` and were counted according to the loop's rules, and `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are also in `a` and were counted according to the loop's rules. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `t` is `t + 1`, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `b` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `aOnes` and `bOnes` are the final counts of how many times the conditions for incrementing them were met during the loop execution. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
