Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 2 characters, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97 (which is the ASCII value of 'a'), and `cur` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')` updates the value of `cur_ss`.
- The value of `cur_ss` is now the ASCII value of the second character of the string `s` minus 97 (the ASCII value of 'a').
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
