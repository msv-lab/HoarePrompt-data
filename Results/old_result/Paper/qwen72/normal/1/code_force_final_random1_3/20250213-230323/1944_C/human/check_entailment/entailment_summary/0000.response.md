Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem by simulating the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. The core logic of the function `func_1` is to use a `Counter` to keep track of the frequency of each number in the array `arr`. The variable `start` is used to simulate the process of picking numbers from the array, starting from 0 and moving upwards. The goal is to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c` after all elements have been picked, which is the MEX of `c`.

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes a `Counter` object `nums` to count the occurrences of each number in `arr`. It also initializes a set `vis` to track the numbers that have been added to `c`.

2. **Main Loop**: The loop continues until the current `start` value is no longer present in `nums` (i.e., it has been completely removed from the array). In each iteration:
   - The current `start` value is added to `vis`.
   - The count of `start` in `nums` is decremented.
   - If `start + 1` is still present in `nums`, it is also decremented, and `start` is incremented by 1.
   - If `start + 1` is not present in `nums`, the function prints `start + 1` and returns, as this is the MEX of the array `c`.

3. **Termination**: If the loop completes without finding a missing integer, the function prints the last processed `start` value, which is the MEX of the array `c`.

The logic correctly simulates the optimal moves of Alice and Bob:
- Alice always tries to pick the smallest available number to maximize the MEX.
- Bob tries to pick the next smallest number to minimize the MEX.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the function correctly identifies the MEX of the array `c` after all elements have been picked.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
