Output State: **`i` is `n_cases - 1`, `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the value of `n` remains 1. If `n` is greater than or equal to `power - 1`, then if `power` equals `n`, `power` remains `n + 1`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `n`, and `power` is not equal to `n + 1`. If `n` is not 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer. If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the index `i` will be one less than the total number of test cases (`n_cases - 1`). The value of `n_cases` remains unchanged and is still greater than or equal to 1. The variable `n` is an input integer that is processed during each iteration of the loop. Depending on the value of `n`, the conditions within the loop are evaluated to determine the final value of `power` and the output. If `n` is 1, the value of `n` remains 1. If `n` is greater than or equal to `power - 1`, the value of `power` is adjusted accordingly. If `n` is not 1, it is transformed into the base-2 logarithm of the input integer, and `power` is adjusted based on whether it equals `n` or not.
