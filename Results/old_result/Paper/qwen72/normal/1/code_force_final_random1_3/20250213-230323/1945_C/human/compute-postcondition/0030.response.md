Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 1, `zero` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[i]` is '0' or '1', respectively, `one` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is '0' or '1', respectively, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 2`, `one_perc` is \((o - \text{one}) \times 100 // (n - 1)\), `lst` is [1] if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` remains an empty list.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `zero_perc` is updated to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. Since `i` is 1, `zero_perc` becomes `zero * 100 // 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
