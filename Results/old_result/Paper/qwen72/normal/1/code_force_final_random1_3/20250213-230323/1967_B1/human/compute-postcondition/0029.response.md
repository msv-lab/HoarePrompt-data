Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 6, `ans` is `n + (int(int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1 + int((int(n / 4) - 3) / 4) + 1 + int((int(n / 5) - 4) / 5) + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 5, `countmins` is 4, `g` is `int(n / 5) - 4`.**

Explanation: The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing from 5 to 6. All other variables remain unchanged.
