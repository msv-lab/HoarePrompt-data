Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases and the integer n for each test case. For example, the function should be defined as `def find_position_of_one(t, n_list):`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `n_list` is a list of integers representing the length of the array a for each test case (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). `n_cases` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n_cases):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        power = 1
        n = log2(n)
        while power < n:
            power += 1
        if power == n:
            print(2 ** power)
        else:
            power -= 1
            print(2 ** power)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n_cases` is greater than 0, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the value of `n` remains 1. If `n` is greater than or equal to `power - 1`, then if `power` equals `n`, `power` remains `n + 1`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `n`, and `power` is not equal to `n + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the value of `n` remains 1. If `n` is greater than or equal to `power - 1`, then if `power` equals `n`, `power` remains `n + 1`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `n`, and `power` is not equal to `n + 1`. If `n` is not 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer. If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 2, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the conditions related to `n` and `power` are re-evaluated based on the new value of `n`. Otherwise, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer. If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains equal to `n`. Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
