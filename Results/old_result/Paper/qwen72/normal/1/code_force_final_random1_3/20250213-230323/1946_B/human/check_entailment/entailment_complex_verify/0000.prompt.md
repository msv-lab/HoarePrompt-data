You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `j` is `t` (which is 0), `b`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `suf`, `smin`, and `sm` will have been updated for each test case according to the logic inside the loop. Specifically, for each test case, `b` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `suf` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of `l`, `smin` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element at index `i` (from 0 to `n`) is the minimum value of `suf[j]` for all `j` from 1 to `i + 1`, and `sm` is the final computed value for the current test case, which is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case includes an integer `n` (the length of an array), an integer `k` (the number of operations), and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function computes a specific value based on the array and the number of operations, then prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function processes all test cases and prints the results one by one. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the calculation of the maximum possible sum after k operations. Specifically, the formula `sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm` is incorrect. This formula attempts to calculate the effect of performing k operations, but it does not correctly account for the exponential growth of the sum due to repeated insertions of the maximum subarray sum.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 3
2 2 8
```
The expected output is `96`, as explained in the problem description. However, the program will output a different result due to the incorrect formula used to calculate the final sum.

### Explanation of the Error:
The correct approach to calculate the maximum possible sum after k operations involves recognizing that the maximum subarray sum can be added to the array up to \(2^k\) times. The correct formula should be:
\[ \text{max\_sum} = (\text{max\_subarray\_sum} \times (2^k - 1)) + \text{initial\_sum} \]

However, the program uses:
\[ \text{sm} = 2^k \times \text{sm} - \text{sm} \]
which simplifies to:
\[ \text{sm} = (2^k - 1) \times \text{sm} \]

This formula is close but does not correctly handle the initial sum of the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
