The code snippet assigns the value of `min(a, b) + m` to the variable `mn`. The minimum of `a` and `b` is calculated, and then `m` is added to this minimum value. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer input by the user, `b` is an integer input by the user, `m` is an integer input by the user, `mn` is the value of `min(a, b) + m`.**
