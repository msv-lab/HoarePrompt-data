Output State: **`t` is an integer where 3 ≤ t ≤ 1442, `s` is a new input string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `h` is the substring of `s` from index 0 to 1 (inclusive), which represents the hours part of the time. If `h` is '00', the program continues with the current values of `t`, `s`, and `h`. If `h` is not '00' and `int(h) <= 12`, the program continues with the current values of `t`, `s`, and `h`. Otherwise, if `int(h) > 12`, the program continues with the same values of `t`, `s`, and `h`.**
