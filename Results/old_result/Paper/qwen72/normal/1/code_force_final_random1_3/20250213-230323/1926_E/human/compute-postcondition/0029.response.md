The code snippet `pow *= 2` multiplies the current value of `pow` by 2. Given the initial state, `pow` is initially 2. After executing the code, `pow` will be 4.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is an input integer that must be at least 1.
- `L` is a list containing the sequence of values `[m1, m2, ..., mk]` where each `mi` is the value of `(ni + 1) // 2` for the corresponding iteration, and `ni` is the value of `n` at the start of each iteration.
- `tot` is `a + a`.
- `a` is the second element in `L`.
- If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, then the postcondition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values `[m1, m2, ..., mk]` where each `mi` is the value of `(ni + 1) // 2` for the corresponding iteration, and `ni` is the value of `n` at the start of each iteration, `tot` is `a + a`, `pow` is 4, `a` is the second element in `L`. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, then the postcondition remains unchanged.**
