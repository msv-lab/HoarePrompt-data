Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either from the beginning or the end of `a` based on the corresponding character in `s`, `l` is `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', or some value between 0 and `n` depending on the number of 'L's in `s`, `r` is -1 if all characters in `s` are 'R', or some value between -1 and `n - 1` depending on the number of 'R's in `s`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is an empty list, `p` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for v in reversed(b):
    p = p * v % m
    ans.append(p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either from the beginning or the end of `a` based on the corresponding character in `s`, `l` is `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', or some value between 0 and `n` depending on the number of 'L's in `s`, `r` is -1 if all characters in `s` are 'R', or some value between -1 and `n - 1` depending on the number of 'R's in `s`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `p`, `p` is `(p * v) % m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either from the beginning or the end of `a` based on the corresponding character in `s`, `l` is `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', or some value between 0 and `n` depending on the number of 'L's in `s`, `r` is -1 if all characters in `s` are 'R', or some value between -1 and `n - 1` depending on the number of 'R's in `s`, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value of `p`, `p` is now `(p * v) % m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either from the beginning or the end of `a` based on the corresponding character in `s`, `l` is `n` if all characters in `s` are 'L', or some value between 0 and `n` depending on the number of 'L's in `s`, `r` is -1 if all characters in `s` are 'R', or some value between -1 and `n - 1` depending on the number of 'R's in `s`, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is a list containing three elements, the first two of which are the value of `p`, and the third element is `(p * b[n-1]) % m`, `p` is now `(p * b[n-1]) % m`, `v` is `b[n-1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
