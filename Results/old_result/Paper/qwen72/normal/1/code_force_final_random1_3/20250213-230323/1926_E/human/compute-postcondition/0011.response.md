Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing two elements `[m, m]`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged and must be greater than 0.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged and is still an input integer.
- The list `L` initially contains one element `[m]`. After executing `L.append(m)`, `L` now contains two elements `[m, m]`.
- The value of `m` remains unchanged and is still `(n + 1) // 2`.
