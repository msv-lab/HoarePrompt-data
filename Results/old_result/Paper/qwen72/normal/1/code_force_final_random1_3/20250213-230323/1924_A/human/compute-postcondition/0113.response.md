Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k`. `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` has been met during the loop. `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`. If `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is further concatenated with the value of `tmp` (if `tmp` is not an empty string) and `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times. `cur` is 0 if the last iteration of the loop caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed but did not cause `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`.***
