### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have a one-dimensional grid with characters `<` and `>`.
   - A pinball starts at a specific cell and moves left or right based on the character.
   - The character in the cell is flipped after the pinball moves.
   - The goal is to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Algorithm Overview**:
   - The program uses two arrays, `A` and `B`, to precompute the number of steps required for the pinball to leave the grid from the left and right sides, respectively.
   - `A` is computed for positions where the character is `>`.
   - `B` is computed for positions where the character is `<`.

3. **Precomputation**:
   - For `A`:
     - Iterate from left to right.
     - If the character is `>`, compute the steps required to reach the next `>` or the boundary.
   - For `B`:
     - Iterate from right to left.
     - If the character is `<`, compute the steps required to reach the next `<` or the boundary.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each starting position, use the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to determine the total steps.
   - The logic involves checking the current character and using the appropriate precomputed values to calculate the total steps.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the pinball might leave the grid immediately or after a few steps.
   - The precomputation ensures that the program can handle large inputs efficiently.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The precomputation steps are linear in terms of the length of the string `s`.
   - The query handling is also linear, making the overall complexity \(O(n)\) for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for solving the problem as described. The precomputation and query handling are well-structured and should handle the given constraints efficiently.

### Correctness:
**True**
