Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of piles, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) represents the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = map(int, input().split())
    lis = sorted(set(l))
    if 1 not in lis or len(lis) == 1:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        test = True
        for j in range(1, len(lis)):
            if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1:
                if j % 2 == 1:
                    print('Bob')
                else:
                    print('Alice')
                test = False
                break
        if test == True:
            if len(lis) % 2 == 1:
                print('Alice')
            else:
                print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, and `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If `1` is not in `lis` or `lis` contains exactly one element, no further changes are made. If `1` is in `lis` and `lis` has at least two elements, `j` is set to the last index of `lis` (which is `len(lis) - 1`). If `test` is True, no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1, and the length of `lis` remains either odd or even as it was initially. If `test` is False, the loop breaks at the first occurrence where a pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1, and `test` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, and `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If `1` is not in `lis` or `lis` has only one element, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `lis` must have at least 2 elements, `j` is the last index of `lis` (i.e., `len(lis) - 1`). If `test` is True, it indicates that no two consecutive elements in `lis` have a difference greater than 1, and the length of `lis` is either odd or even depending on the original length of `lis`. If `test` is False, it indicates that there are two consecutive elements in `lis` with a difference greater than 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, and `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. If `1` is not in `lis` or `lis` has only one element, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `lis` must have at least 2 elements, `j` is the last index of `lis` (i.e., `len(lis) - 1`). If `test` is True, no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1, and the length of `lis` is either odd or even, depending on the original length of `lis`. If `test` is False, the loop breaks and `test` remains False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
