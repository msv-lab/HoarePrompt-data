Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers from the latest user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the last user input, the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is less than the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`, `d2[i]` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]` updates the value of `d2[i]`.
- Since `i` is `n - 2`, `i + 1` is `n - 1`.
- Initially, `d2[n - 1]` is 1.
- Therefore, `d2[i]` is set to `1 + d2[n - 1]`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
