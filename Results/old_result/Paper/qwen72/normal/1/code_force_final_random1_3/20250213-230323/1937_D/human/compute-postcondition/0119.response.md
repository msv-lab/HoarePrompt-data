The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the constant `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `0` and `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than `0`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of the string `s`.

State: **`s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `1`.**
