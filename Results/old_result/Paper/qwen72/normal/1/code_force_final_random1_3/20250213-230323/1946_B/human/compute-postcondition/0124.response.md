Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, the list `smin` has a new last element which is the element at index `i + 1` in the list `suf`. Otherwise, if `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]`, the list `smin` has an additional element at the end, which is `smin[i]`.***
