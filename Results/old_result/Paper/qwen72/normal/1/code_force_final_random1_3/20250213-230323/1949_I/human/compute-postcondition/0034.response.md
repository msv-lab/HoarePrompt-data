Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 2, `x` is a list where each element `x[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the first integer from the corresponding input line, `y` is a list where each element `y[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the second integer from the corresponding input line, `r` is a list where each element `r[j]` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is the third integer from the corresponding input line, `visited` is a list where the element at index `0` is True if `visited[0]` was initially False, otherwise it remains unchanged, and the element at index `1` is True if `visited[1]` was initially False, otherwise it remains unchanged, `coef` is a list where the element at index `0` is 1 if `visited[0]` was initially False, otherwise it remains None, the element at index `1` is 1 if `visited[1]` was initially False, otherwise it remains None, and the element at index `2` is 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is True, `ok` is True if either its original value was True or if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains False.**
