The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `j`, and the string representation of `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` being an element of the string representation of `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is `'2'`, and `N` must be greater than 2. The loop iterates over the characters in the string representation of `i`. Since `i` is 2, the string representation of `i` is `'2'`, which contains only one character.

For the loop to execute one more time, the string representation of `i` would need to have more characters. However, since `i` is 2 and does not change, the string representation remains `'2'`. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again because there are no more characters in the string `'2'` to iterate over.

However, if we consider the next iteration of the outer loop (assuming there is an outer loop that changes `i`), then `i` would increment or change to a new value. For simplicity, let's assume `i` increments to 3. In this case, the string representation of `i` would be `'3'`, which also contains only one character.

Since the question specifies that we should only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and the loop head only involves `i` and `j`, the correct adjustment is:

- `i` remains 2.
- `j` will be the next character in the string representation of `i`, but since there are no more characters, the loop will not execute again.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop (if it were to execute) would be:
State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `'2'`, `N` must be greater than 2, `pd[2]` is now `pd[2] + pd[1] + 4`**

However, since the loop will not execute again due to no more characters in the string representation of `i`, the loop terminates.
