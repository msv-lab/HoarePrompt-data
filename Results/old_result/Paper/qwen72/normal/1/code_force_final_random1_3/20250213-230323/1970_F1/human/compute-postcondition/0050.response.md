Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the new list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)` and an updated entry for `line[0]` with the value `(1, 0)`, `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is now a list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input and must have at least one element, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with entries for each string `s` in `line` that represents a player, with the value `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists. The first list contains tuples `(0, index_of_s)` for each string `s` in `line` that starts with 'B' and ends with 'G'. The second list contains tuples `(0, index_of_s)` for each string `s` in `line` that starts with 'R' and ends with 'G'. If the second character of the element at index `ind` in `line` is 'G', the first list in `goal` also contains the tuple `(1, 0)`, and `tmp` is 0. `ind` is 0, and the element at index `ind` in `line` is not '..'. Additionally, the element at index `ind` in `line` is not a player.***
