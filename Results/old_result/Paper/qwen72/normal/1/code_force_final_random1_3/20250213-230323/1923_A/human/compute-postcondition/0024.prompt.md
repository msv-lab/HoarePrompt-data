You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, representing the number of cells. a is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing whether the cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1). At least one cell contains a chip in each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: _ is t-1, t is greater than or equal to 1, n is an input integer, arr is a string containing the final input with all spaces removed, x is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the final arr or -1 if '1' is not found, y is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string of the final arr or -1 if '1' is not found, z is the substring of the final arr starting from index x and ending at index n - y - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) representing the number of cells, and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 or 1) indicating whether each cell is free or contains a chip. The function processes each test case and returns a list of results, one for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
