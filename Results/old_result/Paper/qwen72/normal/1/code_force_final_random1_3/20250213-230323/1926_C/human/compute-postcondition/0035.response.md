Output State: **`i` is 200000, `pd[200000]` contains the cumulative sum of all previous elements in `pd` plus the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to 199999, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`i`, `pd[200000]`, and `t`) remain unchanged, except that `t` is already specified as `t - 1` in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects these changes.
