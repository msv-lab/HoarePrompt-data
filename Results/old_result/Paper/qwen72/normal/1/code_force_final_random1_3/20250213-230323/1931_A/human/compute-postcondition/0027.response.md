The value of `word` is updated by concatenating `'a'`, the character at index `n - 28` from the `alphabet` list, and `'z'`. Since `word` was initially an empty string, it now contains the new concatenated string. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`**
