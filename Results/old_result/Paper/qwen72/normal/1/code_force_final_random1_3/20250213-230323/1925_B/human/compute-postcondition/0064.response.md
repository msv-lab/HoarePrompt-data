Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the new input, `q` is 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is the maximum of the original `ans` (which was 1) and `x // i`, `(x - n * (x // i))` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `(x - n * (x // i))` is divisible by `(x // i)`**.
