To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop head:

- The state before the loop starts:
  - `arr` is a list of positive integers.
  - `ans` is an empty list.
  - `tem` is 1.

- The loop head:
  ```python
  for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the length of `arr`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the range function generates at least one value for `i`.
   - The range function `range(start, stop, step)` will generate values as long as `start` is greater than or equal to `stop` when `step` is negative.
   - In this case, `start` is `len(arr) - 1`, `stop` is `-1`, and `step` is `-1`.

3. **Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `len(arr) - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - This means `len(arr)` must be greater than 0, i.e., `arr` must have at least one element.

4. **Initial Values for the Loop:**
   - When the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to `len(arr) - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `arr` must have at least one element.
- `i` should be initialized to `len(arr) - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers with at least one element, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**
