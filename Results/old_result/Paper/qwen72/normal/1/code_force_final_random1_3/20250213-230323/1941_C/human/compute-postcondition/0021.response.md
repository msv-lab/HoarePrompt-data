Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves reading an integer `a` (which is not used in the function) and a string `s`. The function counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' within `s` and prints the sum of these counts. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the printed results for each test case. The function does not return any values. **
