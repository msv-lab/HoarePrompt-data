The value of `n` is reassigned to the integer value input by the user. The previous value of `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) is overwritten by the new input value. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `_`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `_` is a throwaway variable that will iterate `t` times.**
