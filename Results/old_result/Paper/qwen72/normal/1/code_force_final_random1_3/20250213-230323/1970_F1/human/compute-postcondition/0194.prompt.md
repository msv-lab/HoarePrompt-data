Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a specific integer read from the input, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input. `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)` and an entry for each string `s` in any `line` that is not '..' with the value `(i, index_of_s)`, where `i` is the iteration index and `index_of_s` is the index of the string `s` in the corresponding `line`. `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams. `allPlayers` is a dictionary with entries for each string `s` in any `line` that represents a player, with the value `False`. `goal` is a list containing two lists. For each string `s` in any `line` that is not '..' and has a second character 'G', the tuple `(i, index_of_s)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`, where `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `s` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. `t` is an integer read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for time in range(t):
    comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    if len(comand) == 3:
        obj, com, el = comand
        if el == '.Q':
            allPlayers[obj] = True
        elif el == '.S':
            team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
            points[team] += 10
            print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
    else:
        obj, com = comand
        pos = elements[obj]
        nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
        if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
            ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
            player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
            print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
        elif com == 'T':
            allPlayers[obj] = False
            if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                team = goalIn(pos)
                print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                points[team] += 1
        elif isPlayer(obj):
            elements[obj] = nxt
        if obj == '.B':
            elements[obj] = nxt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a specific integer read from the input, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)` and an entry for each string `s` in any `line` that is not '..' with the value `(i, index_of_s)`, `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with entries for each string `s` in any `line` that represents a player, with the value `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists. For each string `s` in any `line` that is not '..' and has a second character 'G', the tuple `(i, index_of_s)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`, where `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `s` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line. If the length of `command` is 3, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` is equal to `.Q`, `allPlayers` is updated to set the value `True` for the key `obj` and `False` for all other keys. If `el` is equal to `.S`, `points[team]` is increased by 10, where `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0. If the length of `command` is not 3, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the coordinate pair `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is the new position calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is `.B` and `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is a player, then `player` is set to the player at the position `nxt` in the `grid`. If `obj` is not `.B`, the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element, and `el` is the third element. If `el` is '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. If `el` is '.S', `team` is set to 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is set to 0, and `points[team]` is incremented by 10. If `len(command) != 3`, `obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string, `pos` is the value associated with `obj` in the dictionary `elements`, and `nxt` is a tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is '.B', `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. Otherwise, the values of `command`, `obj`, `com`, `pos`, and `nxt` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`command` is a list of strings. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element, `com` is the second element, and `el` is the third element. If `el` is '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. If `el` is '.S', `team` is set to 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is set to 0, and `points[team]` is incremented by 10. If `len(command) != 3`, `obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string, `pos` is the value associated with `obj` in the dictionary `elements`, and `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj == '.B' and (isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or (isPlayer(obj) and elements['.B'] == nxt))`, then `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `obj == '.B' and com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`. If `obj == '.B' and goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)` and `points[team]` is incremented by 1. If `obj == '.B' and com` is not 'T' and `obj` is a player, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `obj` is not '.B', all other variables remain unchanged. `time` is `x + 1`, and `t` must be greater than `x + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
