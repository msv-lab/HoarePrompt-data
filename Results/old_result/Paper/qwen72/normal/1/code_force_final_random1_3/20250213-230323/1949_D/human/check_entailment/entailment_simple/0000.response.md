### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` and then `n` lines of input, each representing a row in the transition matrix.
   - It initializes lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each scenario.
   - It also initializes a list `xx` to store the input lines, with an empty string prepended to make indexing easier.

2. **Counting 'F' and 'S' Transitions:**
   - The program iterates through each character in the input lines. If the character is 'F', it increments the corresponding entries in `a`. If the character is 'S', it increments the corresponding entries in `b`.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Only 'F' or 'S':**
   - The program creates two lists, `sa` and `sb`, to store the indices of scenarios that have only 'F' transitions or only 'S' transitions, respectively.

4. **Handling Undecided Transitions:**
   - The program checks if the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. If so, it appends indices of scenarios with no transitions to `sa`.
   - It then constructs the output by iterating through the input lines again. For each undecided transition ('?'), it decides whether to use 'F' or 'S' based on the position of the scenario in `sa` or `sb`.

5. **Output Construction:**
   - If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, the program ensures that the first `n // 4` scenarios in `sa` are used to place 'F' transitions, and the rest are used to place 'S' transitions.
   - If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, the program ensures that the first `n // 4` scenarios in `sb` are used to place 'S' transitions, and the rest are used to place 'F' transitions.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Input Validation:** The program correctly reads and processes the input according to the problem description.
- **Transition Counting:** The program accurately counts the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each scenario.
- **Scenario Identification:** The program correctly identifies scenarios with only 'F' or 'S' transitions and handles scenarios with no transitions.
- **Undecided Transition Handling:** The program ensures that the number of consecutive 'F' or 'S' transitions does not exceed \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) by strategically placing 'F' and 'S' transitions.
- **Output Format:** The program outputs the transition matrix in the required format, respecting the constraints and ensuring that the transition videos meet the problem's requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
