Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by `n` input strings. The lists `a` and `b` are updated based on the characters in each input string `x` as follows: for each character 'F' at position `j-1` in the string `x`, both `a[i]` and `a[j]` are incremented by 1; for each character 'S' at position `j-1` in the string `x`, both `b[i]` and `b[j]` are incremented by 1. `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`. `sb` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. Additionally, the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if a[i] == 0 and b[i] == 0:
        sa.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 1, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by `n` input strings, `a` and `b` are updated based on the characters in each input string `x`, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. If `a[1] == 0` and `b[1] == 0`, `sa` now includes the index `1`, and the length of `sa` is still greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 2, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by `n` input strings, `a` and `b` are updated based on the characters in each input string `x`. If `a[2] == 0` and `b[2] == 0`, `sa` now includes the index `2`, and `sb` remains unchanged. If `a[1] == 0` and `b[1] == 0`, `sa` also includes the index `1`, and the length of `sa` is still greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `i` is 3, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by `n` input strings, `a` and `b` are updated based on the characters in each input string `x`. If `a[3] == 0` and `b[3] == 0`, `sa` now includes the value 3, and if `a[2] == 0` and `b[2] == 0`, `sa` also includes the index `2`, and `sb` remains unchanged. If `a[1] == 0` and `b[1] == 0`, `sa` also includes the index `1`, and the length of `sa` is still greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. If `a[3] != 0` or `b[3] != 0`, `sa` and `sb` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
