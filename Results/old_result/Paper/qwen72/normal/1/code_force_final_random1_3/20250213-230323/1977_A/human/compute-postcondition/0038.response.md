The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This operation updates the values of `n` and `m` based on the input provided. The initial conditions about the relationships and parities of `n` and `m` are no longer relevant because the new values of `n` and `m` are determined by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. The parity (even or odd) of `n` and `m` is determined by the input values.**
