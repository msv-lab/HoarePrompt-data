Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` and `b` are updated to the positive integers provided by the input, and `i` is 1. If both `a` and `b` are even, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. If either `a` or `b` is odd, and the condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` or `(a - b) % 2` is non-zero, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i` also remain unchanged.***
