The code snippet `b[i] += 1` increments the value of the element at index `i` in the list `b` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide the values of `b` or `i`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new value of `b[i]`. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3, and the element at index `i` in the list `b` is incremented by 1.**
