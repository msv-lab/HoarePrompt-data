Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 2 characters, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97 (which is the ASCII value of 'a'), and `cur` is now equal to 1 shifted left by `cur_ss` positions.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cur` is updated to `1 << cur_ss`.
- `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur_ss`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
