Output State: **`i` is 2, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers from the input, and `int(input())` must be greater than 2. If `B * 2` is less than `C`, no further changes are made. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, and if `A` is even, no further changes are made. If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C` and `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are now updated to the integers provided by the input.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The condition `int(input())` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
- The conditions regarding `B * 2` and `A` remain unchanged, and `X` is set to `A // 2` only if both conditions (`B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd) are met.
