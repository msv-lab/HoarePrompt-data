Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `p` is a list containing the elements [0, `i + x`, `i + x`, `i`]. If `x` (the next element in the list `l`) is 1, then `c` is a list containing the elements [0, `j + 1`, `j + 1`, `j`], and `j` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `c` is a list containing the elements [0, `j`, `j`, `j`].**
