Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the number of cells `n`.
   - It reads the array of cells `arr` and removes any spaces.
   - It finds the index of the first chip (`x`) and the index of the last chip from the right (`y`).
   - It extracts the substring `z` that contains only the cells between the first and last chip.
   - It counts the number of free cells (`0`s) in this substring and prints the count.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
