### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `na_frente` (number of people in front of Kirill) and `pos_final` (the maximum position Kirill wants to be in).
   - It reads two lists: `custo_pra_trocar_a` (cost to swap with the person at position `i`) and `custo_pra_passar_b` (cost to pass the person at position `i`).

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The indices are adjusted by subtracting 1 from `na_frente` and `pos_final` to convert them to 0-based indexing.

3. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - `total` is initialized to 0, which will keep track of the total cost.
   - `best` is initialized to a large value (`10 ** 12`), which will store the minimum cost to reach a position within `pos_final`.

4. **Iterating Backwards:**
   - The loop iterates from `na_frente` to 0 (inclusive) in reverse order.
   - For each position `v`:
     - If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, it checks if the current total cost plus the cost to swap with the person at position `v` is less than the current best cost. If so, it updates `best`.
     - It then adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.
     - If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, it simply adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all positions, it prints the value of `best` for the current test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly handles the problem of finding the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position within `pos_final`.
- The use of a large initial value for `best` ensures that it gets updated with the actual minimum cost.
- The loop iterates backwards, ensuring that the costs are accumulated correctly and the minimum cost is found.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
