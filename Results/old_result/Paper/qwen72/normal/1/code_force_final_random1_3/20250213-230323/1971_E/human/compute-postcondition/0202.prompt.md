Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), representing the number of test cases. The other variables (n, k, q, a, b, and d) remain as described in the initial state.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    ad = [0]
    bd = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])
    v = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])
    for l in range(q):
        m = 0
        i = 1
        ql = int(input())
        s = bisect_left(a, ql)
        if a[s] == ql:
            print(b[s], end=' ')
            continue
        ql -= a[s - 1]
        m += b[s - 1]
        m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
        print(int(m), end=' ')
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop has executed all iterations, the variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `i`, and `v` retain their original values. The variable `l` is incremented to `q`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `m` will have been updated multiple times during the loop, but its final value depends on the specific inputs and the calculations performed within each iteration. The variable `s` will be the index where the last `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order. The variable `ql` will be the value of the last input integer minus `a[s - 1]`. If `a[s] == ql` was true for any iteration, those iterations were skipped, and the corresponding `ql` values were not used in the calculation of `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is 0, `t` remains the same, `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned new values from the input where `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the input and must have at least `len(a) + 1` elements, `ad` is now `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`, `bd` is now `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b)-1] - b[len(b)-2]]`, `i` is 1, `v` is now `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `m` is the final computed value after all iterations, `ql` is the last input integer minus the corresponding `a[s - 1]` value, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the last updated `ql`, and `l` is equal to `q`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 1, `t` remains the same, `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned new values from the input where `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `ad` is now `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`, `bd` is now `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b)-1] - b[len(b)-2]]`, `i` is 1, `v` is now `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `m` is updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` for each iteration, `ql` is now the integer input by the user minus `a[s - 1]` for each iteration, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the original `ql` for each iteration, `l` is `q - 1`. If `a[s]` is exactly equal to the original `ql` for any iteration, the corresponding iteration ends and the loop continues to the next iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
