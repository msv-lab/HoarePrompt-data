Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of extroverts cannot be fully accommodated even with the help of universals. For example, consider the input `1 4 1`:

- There is 1 introvert, which requires 1 tent.
- There are 4 extroverts, which require 4 / 3 = 1.33 tents, but since we can't split tents, we need 2 tents to accommodate all extroverts.
- There is 1 universal, which can help fill the remaining spots in the tents.

However, the program incorrectly outputs `-1` for this case, whereas the correct output should be `3` (1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 tent for the remaining extrovert and the universal).

The issue lies in the logic of the program, specifically in how it handles the distribution of universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents. The program does not correctly account for the possibility of using universals to complete the required tent configurations for extroverts.
