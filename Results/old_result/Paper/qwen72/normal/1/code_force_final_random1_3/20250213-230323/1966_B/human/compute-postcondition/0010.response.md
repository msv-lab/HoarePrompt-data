Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an input integer between 1 and 10^4, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`tc`**: Remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains the same input integer, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`m`**: Remains the same input integer, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`gr`**: After the loop completes, `gr` will contain `n` input strings, as the loop appends one input string to `gr` for each iteration from 0 to `n-1`.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1`, as the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`.
