Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` remains the same, `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned new values from the input where `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `ad` is now `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`, `bd` is now `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b)-1] - b[len(b)-2]]`, `i` is 2, `v` is now `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2]]`, `m` is not yet computed, `ql` is not yet updated, `s` is not yet determined, and `l` is not yet updated.**

Explanation:
- The value of `v` is updated by appending `ad[2] / bd[2]` to it.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
