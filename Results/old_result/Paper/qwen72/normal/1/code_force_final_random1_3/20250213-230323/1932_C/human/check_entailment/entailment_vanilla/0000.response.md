Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle the logic for each test case. It takes `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` as parameters.

3. **Command Processing**:
   - The program initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to track the left and right ends of the array `a`.
   - It iterates through the command string `s` and appends the appropriate element to the list `b` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
   - If the command is 'L', it appends the element at index `l` and increments `l`.
   - If the command is 'R', it appends the element at index `r` and decrements `r`.

4. **Product Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `p` to 1, which will be used to accumulate the product of the elements.
   - It iterates through the list `b` in reverse order, multiplying the current value of `p` by the current element and taking the result modulo `m`.
   - It appends the result to the list `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the reversed list `ans`, which ensures that the results are in the correct order (from the first command to the last).
   - The main loop prints the results for each test case using the `print` function with the `*` operator to unpack the list.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `n` is 1 or when all commands are the same ('L' or 'R').

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic and handle the input and output as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
