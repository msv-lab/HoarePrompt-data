Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the MEX Concept**: The MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set. For example, MEX([0, 1, 2]) = 3, MEX([1, 2, 3]) = 0, and MEX([0, 2, 3]) = 1.

2. **Reconstructing the Permutation**:
   - The array `a` is defined such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - To reconstruct the permutation `p`, we need to find `p_i` for each `i` such that the above equation holds true.
   - The key observation is that `p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i`.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for MEX initially.
   - It iterates over the array `ar` in reverse order, calculating `p_i` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function correctly calculates `p_i` using the formula `p_i = mex - ar[i]`.
   - The update condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]: mex = mex - ar[i]` ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of the permutation.
   - The function prints the resulting permutation `res` for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where `n` is small (e.g., `n = 1`) and large (up to `2 * 10^5`).
   - The function processes multiple test cases correctly.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `5 1 1 -2 1 2`, the function correctly outputs `0 1 4 2 3`.
   - For the input `5 1 1 1 1 1`, the function correctly outputs `0 1 2 3 4`.
   - For the input `3 -2 1 2`, the function correctly outputs `2 0 1`.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`.

Correctness: **True**
