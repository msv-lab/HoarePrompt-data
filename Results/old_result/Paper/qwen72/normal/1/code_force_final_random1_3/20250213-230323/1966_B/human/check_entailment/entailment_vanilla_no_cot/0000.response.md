Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in its approach to determining whether the grid can be made uniform in color. Specifically, the conditions under which it sets `impossible` to `True` and then checks for consecutive cells being different are not sufficient to cover all scenarios where making the grid uniform is impossible.

The core issue is that the algorithm only checks the first and last rows and columns for consecutive differences. This is not enough because there could be other configurations within the grid that prevent it from becoming uniform, even if the edges meet the criteria.

A more robust approach would involve checking if there are any two adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically) of different colors. If such a pair exists and they are not part of a larger contiguous block of the same color, it might be impossible to make the entire grid uniform.

Here's a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check if there are any adjacent cells of different colors
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if i < n-1 and gr[i][j] != gr[i+1][j]:
                    print('NO')
                    break
                if j < m-1 and gr[i][j] != gr[i][j+1]:
                    print('NO')
                    break
            else:
                continue
            break
        else:
            print('YES')
```

This version checks every cell against its neighbors and prints "NO" if any adjacent cells have different colors, which correctly identifies cases where the grid cannot be made uniform. If no such pairs are found, it prints "YES".
