Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged. If `xx[i][1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][1]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb` (i.e., `sb[:n // 4]`), `nx` is updated to `nx + 'S'`. Otherwise, `nx` is updated to `nx + 'F'`.***
