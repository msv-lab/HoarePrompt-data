Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 1000, `a[1]` is 1000 + `x[0]`, and all other elements are 0, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` updates the element at index `i` of the list `a`.
- Initially, `a[0]` is 1000 and all other elements are 0.
- Since `i` is 1, `a[1]` is updated to `a[0] + x[0]`, which is `1000 + x[0]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
