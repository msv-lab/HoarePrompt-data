Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the new input, `q` is 1, `i` is 2, and `ans` is 1. If `x % i == 0`, and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)`, then `ans` is `max(2, x // 2)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.***
