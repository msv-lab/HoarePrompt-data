Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `b` is a new list of integers converted from the new input string, `i` is the index up to which `a` and `b` have matching elements or the length of `a` (whichever is smaller), `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except for the first `i` elements which are now `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and the `i`-th element is now `max(a[i], b[i])`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except for the first `i` elements which are now `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`. The elements of `a` and `b` from index 0 to `i-1` must be equal, and `i` is not equal to the length of `a`.**
