Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 1, `nx` is an empty string, and the character at position `j-1` (which is 0) in the string `xx[i]` is '?'. Additionally, either `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.**
