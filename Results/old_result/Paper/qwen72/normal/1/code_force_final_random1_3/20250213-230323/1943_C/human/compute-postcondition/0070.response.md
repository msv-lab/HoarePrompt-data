To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`ops` List Construction:**
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
     - `ops` contains tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., up to `(c, ci)`, where `c` is the element at the middle index of `path_ba` and `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even:
     - `ops` contains tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, `(c2, 5)`, ..., `(c1, len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`, `(c2, len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.

2. **Other Variables:**
   - `n` is the last non-negative value in the `previous` list that leads back to node 0.
   - `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to the original `n`, each sublist contains the indices of the nodes connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index.
   - `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes.
   - `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node.
   - `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
   - `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
   - `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` followed by the sequence of node indices leading back to node 0, including the final value of `n`.

### Code Execution:
The `print` statement uses the `map` function to apply a lambda function to each tuple in the `ops` list. The lambda function formats each tuple `(x[0], x[1])` as a string in the format `f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine the Structure of `ops`:**
   - If `path_ba` has an odd length, `ops` will contain tuples where the first element is the middle element of `path_ba` and the second element ranges from 0 to the middle index.
   - If `path_ba` has an even length, `ops` will contain pairs of tuples where the first elements alternate between `c1` and `c2`, and the second elements are odd numbers up to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`.

2. **Apply the Lambda Function:**
   - For each tuple `(x[0], x[1])` in `ops`, the lambda function `lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'` will produce a string where the first element is incremented by 1 and the second element remains the same.

3. **Print the Formatted Strings:**
   - The `print` statement will print each formatted string on a new line.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `path_ba` has an even length of 6:
- `c1 = 2` (half of 6 - 1)
- `c2 = 3` (half of 6)
- `ops` will be `[(2, 1), (3, 1), (2, 3), (3, 3), (2, 5), (3, 5)]`

Applying the lambda function:
- `(2, 1)` becomes `3 1`
- `(3, 1)` becomes `4 1`
- `(2, 3)` becomes `3 3`
- `(3, 3)` becomes `4 3`
- `(2, 5)` becomes `3 5`
- `(3, 5)` becomes `4 5`

### Final Output:
Output: **3 1
4 1
3 3
4 3
3 5
4 5**

This is the output based on the given initial state and the structure of the `ops` list. If the length of `path_ba` were odd, the output would be different but would follow the same pattern of incrementing the first element by 1 and keeping the second element as is.
