To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions it imposes:

```python
for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces.
   - `y` is `num_fila - 2`.
   - `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`.
   - `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`.
   - `custo` is increased by the value of either `a_values[num_fila - 2]` if `a_values[y] < b_values[y]`, or by the value of `b_values[num_fila - 2]` otherwise.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `y` starting from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1` with a step of `-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1 and still satisfy the condition `y >= max_p - 1`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is `num_fila - 2`.
   - For the next iteration, `y` should be `num_fila - 3`.
   - The condition `y >= max_p - 1` must still hold true.

5. **Final Adjusted State**:
   - `y` is `num_fila - 3`.
   - `num_fila` remains greater than or equal to `max_p`.

### Final State:
State: **`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is `num_fila - 3`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, and `custo` is increased by the value of either `a_values[num_fila - 2]` if `a_values[y] < b_values[y]`, or by the value of `b_values[num_fila - 2]` otherwise.**
