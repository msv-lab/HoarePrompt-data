### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires performing a balanced shuffle operation on a balanced parentheses sequence. This involves computing the balance of each prefix, sorting the characters based on their balance and position, and then constructing the new sequence from the sorted characters.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function is intended to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position.
     - It returns the difference in balance if the balances are different.
     - If the balances are the same, it returns the difference in positions in reverse order (i.e., higher positions come first).
     - However, this function is not directly used in the main logic of `func_2`. It seems to be a leftover or a placeholder for a custom comparison function that could be used in a different context.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function takes a string `s` as input.
     - It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects.
     - It iterates over the string `s`, computing the balance at each position and appending a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info`.
     - After computing all balances, it sorts the `balance_info` list based on the balance and position using a lambda function.
     - Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list and prints it.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The balance is correctly computed by incrementing for '(' and decrementing for ')'.
   - The sorting logic is correct: it sorts by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order when balances are equal.
   - The construction of the result string from the sorted list is correct.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the input constraints (non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with length up to 500,000) efficiently.
   - The sorting step is efficient enough for the given constraints.

5. **Function Summary Verification:**
   - The function summary for `func_2` accurately describes the behavior of the function. It correctly states that the function processes the string to create a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, sorts them, and constructs the new string, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.
   - The original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
