The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `s`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and `s` is a binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The function returns a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer between 1 and 500, and `s`, a binary string of length between 1 and 500. The function returns a result based on the values of `t` and `s`.**
