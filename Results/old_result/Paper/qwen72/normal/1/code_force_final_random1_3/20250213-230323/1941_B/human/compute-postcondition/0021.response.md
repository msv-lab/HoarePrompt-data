The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it can be inferred that the function accepts multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and an array `a` of integers. Specifically:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of elements in the array.
- The array `a` consists of `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. However, the specific output or return value for each test case is not provided in the problem statement.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
