Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list.**

The code snippet `num = []` reassigns the variable `num` to an empty list, which was already its initial state. Therefore, the values of `n`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged, and `num` remains an empty list.
