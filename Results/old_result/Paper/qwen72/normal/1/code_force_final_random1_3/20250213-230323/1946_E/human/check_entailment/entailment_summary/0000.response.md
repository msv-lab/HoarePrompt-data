### Reasoning:

1. **Factorial Precomputation**:
   - The program precomputes factorials up to \(200,000\) and stores them in the list `facts`. This is necessary for efficiently calculating combinations and permutations later in the program.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation \(n\), the number of prefix maximums \(m_1\), and the number of suffix maximums \(m_2\). It also reads the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

3. **Initial Validity Check**:
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index is the same as the first suffix maximum index, the first prefix maximum index is 1, and the last suffix maximum index is \(n\). If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, indicating no valid permutations exist.

4. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The program uses the function `func_2` to calculate combinations. The function `func_2` itself uses `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of a number, which is necessary for calculating combinations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Permutation Counting**:
   - The program iterates over the suffix maximums and prefix maximums to calculate the number of valid permutations. It uses the precomputed factorials and the combination function to count the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements between the maximums.

6. **Final Output**:
   - The final result is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Analysis of Functions:

- **`func_1`**:
  - This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. It is used to compute the modular inverse of a number.

- **`func_2`**:
  - This function calculates the modular inverse of `b` and multiplies it by `a`, returning the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is used to compute combinations efficiently.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, and the use of precomputed factorials and modular arithmetic ensures efficiency and correctness.

### Correctness:
**True**
