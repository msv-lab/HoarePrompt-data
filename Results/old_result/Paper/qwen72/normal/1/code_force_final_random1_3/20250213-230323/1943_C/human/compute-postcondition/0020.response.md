Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` remains the same as the initial input integer, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to `n`. Each sublist in `u2vs` contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index. The connections are bidirectional, meaning if node `u` is connected to node `v`, then both `u2vs[u]` will contain `v` and `u2vs[v]` will contain `u`. The loop has run `n-1` times, so each pair of connected nodes has been added to their respective sublists.**
