t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an even integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of columns in the grid. The strings representing the first and second rows of the grid each contain exactly n characters, which are either '<' or '>', indicating the direction of the arrows in the cells. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
