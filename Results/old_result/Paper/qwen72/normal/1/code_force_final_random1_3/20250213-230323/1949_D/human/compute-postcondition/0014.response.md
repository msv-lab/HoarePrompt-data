Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` starts at 1 and increments up to `n`. If the character at position `j-1` in the list `x` is 'S', the value at index `j` in the list `b` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the character at position `j-1` in the list `x` is not 'F' and the list `b` remains unchanged.***
