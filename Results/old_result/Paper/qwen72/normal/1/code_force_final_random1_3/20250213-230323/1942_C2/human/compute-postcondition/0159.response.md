The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it appears that the function should accept multiple parameters to operate correctly. The parameters include:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
  - `x`: An integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5).
  - `y`: An integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x.
  - A list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

Given these parameters, the function processes each test case and returns a result based on the inputs. However, the specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the given parameters.**
