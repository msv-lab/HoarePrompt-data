The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `n` respectively. This updates the values of `x` and `n` from their initial states.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `x` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 1
- `n` is the second integer from the input
- `q` is 1
- `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`
- `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` such that `x - n * d` is non-negative and divisible by `d`, where `d` is a divisor of `x` and `d` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`. If no such divisor exists, `ans` remains 1.

After executing the code:
- `x` is now the first integer from the new input
- `n` is now the second integer from the new input

The other variables (`t`, `q`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `n` is the second integer from the new input, `q` is 1, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, and `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` such that `x - n * d` is non-negative and divisible by `d`, where `d` is a divisor of `x` and `d` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`. If no such divisor exists, `ans` remains 1.**
