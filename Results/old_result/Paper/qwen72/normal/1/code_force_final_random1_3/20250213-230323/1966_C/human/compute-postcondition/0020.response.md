To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `tc` is an input integer where 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4 - 1.
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `dp` is `True`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (exclusive).
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n` but does not include `n`).

### States to Adjust:
- The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
- To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 1.
- The initial value of `i` is `n-1`, but this is not relevant to the loop head.

### Conclusion:
- The state of `n` must be adjusted to ensure it is greater than 1.
- The state of `i` is not relevant to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`tc` is an input integer where 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4 - 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `n-1`, `dp` is `True`**
