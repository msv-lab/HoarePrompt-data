The only object in the loop head is the variable `l`, and the loop iterates over the range defined by `q`. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to increment `l` by 1 for the next iteration to occur. The value of `q` must remain such that `l` is still within the range of `q` for the loop to continue executing.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, all other variables retain their original values, and `l` was the last value before the loop condition was checked, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented by 1, and `q` must be greater than the new value of `l`.

State: **All variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `i`, `v`, `s`, `ql`, `m`) retain their original values, `l` is incremented by 1, `q` must be greater than the new value of `l`.**
