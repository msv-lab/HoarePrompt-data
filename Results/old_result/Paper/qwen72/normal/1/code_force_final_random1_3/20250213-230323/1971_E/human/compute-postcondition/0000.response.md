Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), representing the number of test cases. The other variables (n, k, q, a, b, and d) remain as described in the initial state.**

Explanation: The code snippet `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `t` to the integer input provided by the user. The constraints for `t` are that it is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive. The other variables (n, k, q, a, b, and d) are not affected by this code snippet and retain their initial descriptions.
