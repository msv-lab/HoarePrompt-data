Postcondition: ***`x` must be at least 0, `c` is `i // 2`, `val` is sorted with even numbers first followed by odd numbers and must have at least one element, `sx` is the count of how many times `c` was equal to 1 during the loop plus `i`. If `y < c`, `sx` is incremented by `y * 2`, `y` is updated to `y - c` from the previous iteration, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `y` remains as `y - c` from the previous iteration, and `cons`, `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.***
