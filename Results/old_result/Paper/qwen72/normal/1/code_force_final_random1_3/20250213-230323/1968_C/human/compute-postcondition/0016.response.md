The code snippet `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the integer value provided by the user
- `x` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `a` is a list of length `n` where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for 1 ≤ i < n) is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]`
- The loop variable `i` is equal to `n-1`

After executing the code snippet, the variable `x` is updated to a new list of integers provided by the user. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value provided by the user, `x` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of length `n` where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for 1 ≤ i < n) is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]`, `i` is equal to `n-1`.**
