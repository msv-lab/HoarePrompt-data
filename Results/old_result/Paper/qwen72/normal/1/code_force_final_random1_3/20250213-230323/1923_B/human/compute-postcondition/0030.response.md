Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the health of each monster in the list `a` will be reduced according to the number of bullets fired, and the variable `rest` will be 0 or the remaining bullets that could not be used because there were no more monsters with non-zero health to target. The variable `pos` will be the index of the next monster in the `sorted_indices` list that has not been fully defeated, or it will be equal to the length of `sorted_indices` if all monsters have been defeated. All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, `distance`) will retain their initial values.**
