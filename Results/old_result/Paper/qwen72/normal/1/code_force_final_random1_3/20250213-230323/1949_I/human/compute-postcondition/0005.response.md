Output State: **n is an input integer between 1 and 1000, x is a list of None values of length n, y is a list of None values of length n, r is a list of None values of length n, visited is a list of False values of length n, coef is a list of None values of length n.**

The code `coef = [None] * n` initializes the `coef` list to contain `None` values of length `n`. Since `n` is already defined as an input integer between 1 and 1000, the `coef` list is now correctly initialized to match the length of `n`. All other variables (`x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
