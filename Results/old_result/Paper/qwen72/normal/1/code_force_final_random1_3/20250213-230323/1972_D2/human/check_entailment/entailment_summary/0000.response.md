### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input.
     - It iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) to find pairs \((x, y)\) such that:
       - \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\)
       - \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\)
       - \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\)
     - For each valid pair, it increments the count `cnt`.
     - Finally, it prints the count of valid pairs.
   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function reads an integer \(t\) from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
     - It then calls `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Validation of Conditions**:
   - The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is not directly checked in `func_1`. Instead, the function checks pairs \((x, y)\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and ensures that \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\).
   - However, the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is equivalent to checking if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and the constraints on \(x\) and \(y\) are satisfied. This is because if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = b\) and \(a + b\) must divide \(b\).

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The function handles the constraints \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\) and \(1 \le t \le 10^4\) correctly.
   - The function also correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True****
