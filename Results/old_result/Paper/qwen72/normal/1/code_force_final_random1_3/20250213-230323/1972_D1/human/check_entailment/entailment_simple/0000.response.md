### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterating over them.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` using `func_7()`, which reads a line of input and splits it into integers.

2. **Logic for Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - The function `func_15()` is responsible for counting the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The loop in `func_15()` iterates over possible values of `i` and calculates the number of valid pairs using the formula `(n + i) // (i * i)`.
   - The condition `while i * i <= n + i` ensures that the loop terminates when `i` is no longer a valid candidate for the calculation.
   - The final result is adjusted by subtracting 1 from the accumulated sum.

3. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the result for each test case using `sys.stdout.write`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as small values of `n` and `m` (e.g., `1 1`) and large values up to the specified limits (e.g., `1000000 1145141`).

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The loop in `func_15()` runs in \(O(\sqrt{n})\) time, which is efficient given the constraints \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions. It handles input and output correctly and efficiently processes the test cases within the given constraints.
