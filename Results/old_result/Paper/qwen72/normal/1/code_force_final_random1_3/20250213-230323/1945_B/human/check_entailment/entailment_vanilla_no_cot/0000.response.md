Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The logic in the given program does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. Here are the issues:

1. The calculation `mn = min(a, b) + m` is used to determine the period over which to count the number of fireworks. However, this does not accurately represent the time span during which the maximum number of fireworks can be seen simultaneously.

2. The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1):` is not necessary and does not align with the problem's requirements. This condition checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, but this is not relevant to determining the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks.

3. The formula `print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)` is incorrect. It adds an extra `1` without a clear justification, and it does not account for the overlap between the two sequences of fireworks.

A correct approach would involve calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of the combined firing schedule and then using this to find the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        l = lcm(a, b)
        max_fireworks = (m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b - (m + 1) // l
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This corrected function uses the LCM to avoid double-counting the overlapping fireworks and correctly calculates the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks.
