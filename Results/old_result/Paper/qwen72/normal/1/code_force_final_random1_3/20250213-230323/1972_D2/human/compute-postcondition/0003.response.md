The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and `func_1()` has been called. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0, but since the loop counter `_` is not used, it does not change. However, the loop itself will decrement `t` by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `func_1()` has been called** 

However, to be precise about the state at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `func_1()` has been called** 

This ensures that `t` is decremented by 1 and still remains greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.
