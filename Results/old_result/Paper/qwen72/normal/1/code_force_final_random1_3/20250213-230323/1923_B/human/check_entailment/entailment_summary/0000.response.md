Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Parameters**: `a` (health of monsters), `x` (positions of monsters), `k` (bullets per second).
   - **Behavior**: The function sorts the monsters based on their distance from the origin (0). It then iterates through the sorted list, attempting to reduce the health of each monster by firing up to `k` bullets per second. If a monster's position becomes 0 (i.e., it reaches the origin), the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it continues until all monsters are defeated or the process completes.
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly handles the logic of firing bullets and checking if any monster reaches the origin. It ensures that the closest monsters are prioritized, which is essential for survival.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - **Parameters**: None (reads input directly).
   - **Behavior**: This function reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns `True`, and 'NO' otherwise.
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly processes the input and output for multiple test cases. It uses the results from `func_1` to determine the outcome for each test case.

3. **Overall Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles multiple test cases and ensures that the game rules are followed accurately.
   - The sorting and processing of monsters based on their distance from the origin is a crucial part of the solution, and both functions handle this correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
