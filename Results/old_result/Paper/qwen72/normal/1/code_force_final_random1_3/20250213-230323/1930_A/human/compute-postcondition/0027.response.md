Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is 0, `i` is 2 * n - 2, and the loop has completed all its iterations.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets `score` to 0.
- The initial state specifies that `score` was previously the sum of every second element starting from the first element of `l`.
- After executing the code, `score` is reset to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `i`) and conditions (loop completion) remain unchanged.
