Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s[:n-1]`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s[:n-1]`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` must contain at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in `lst`, `final` is a list containing `elem`.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` adds the second element of the list `lst` to the list `final`. All other variables remain unchanged. The final state includes all the initial conditions plus the updated `final` list which now contains `elem`.
