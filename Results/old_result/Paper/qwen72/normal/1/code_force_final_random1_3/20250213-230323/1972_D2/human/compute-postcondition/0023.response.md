To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
- `x` is 2.
- `y` is 1.
- `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of \( \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \) and \( \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \) for all pairs \((x, y)\) where \(\gcd(x, y) == 1\) and \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
- `n` must be at least 4.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
1. \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\)
2. \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\)

Substituting the initial values of `x` and `y`:
- \(x = 2\)
- \(y = 1\)

So, the conditions become:
1. \((2 + 1) \cdot 2 \leq n\)
2. \((2 + 1) \cdot 1 \leq m\)

Simplifying these:
1. \(3 \cdot 2 \leq n \Rightarrow 6 \leq n\)
2. \(3 \cdot 1 \leq m \Rightarrow 3 \leq m\)

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 6.
- `m` must be at least 3.

Given the initial state, `n` is already required to be at least 4, but for the loop to execute, it must be at least 6. `m` is already a positive integer, but it must be at least 3.

### Final State:
- `n` must be at least 6.
- `m` must be at least 3.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

State: **`n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 3, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.**
