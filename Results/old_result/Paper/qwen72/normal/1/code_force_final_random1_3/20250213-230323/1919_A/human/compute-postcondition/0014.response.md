Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is a throwaway variable, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and they are set to the input values for the last iteration, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` must have been at least as large as the number of iterations performed.
- The variable `_` is still a throwaway variable and does not hold any significant value.
- The list `results` contains the results of calling `func_1(a, b)` for each of the `t` iterations.
- The variables `a` and `b` hold the values from the last iteration, which are positive integers between 1 and 10^9.
- The variable `winner` holds the result of the last call to `func_1(a, b)`.
