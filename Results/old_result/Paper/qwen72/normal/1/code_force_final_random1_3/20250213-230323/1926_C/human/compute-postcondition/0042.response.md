Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n`. It precomputes a list `pd` where each element `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`. For each test case, it prints the value of `pd[n]`. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the cumulative digit sum for each provided `n`, and the program state includes the precomputed list `pd` and the processed test cases. **
