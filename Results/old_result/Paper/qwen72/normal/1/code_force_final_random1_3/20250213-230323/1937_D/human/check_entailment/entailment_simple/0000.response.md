### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.
   - The string `s` is processed by the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `A` and `idx_A` are initialized to store cumulative counts and indices of '>' characters.
     - `B` and `idx_B` are initialized to store cumulative counts and indices of '<' characters from the end of the string.
   
   - **Processing '>' Characters:**
     - The first loop iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
     - For each '>' character, it calculates the cumulative count and stores it in `A`.
     - It also stores the index of the '>' character in `idx_A`.
   
   - **Processing '<' Characters:**
     - The second loop iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
     - For each '<' character, it calculates the cumulative count and stores it in `B`.
     - It also stores the index of the '<' character in `idx_B`.
   
   - **Calculating the Time for Each Cell:**
     - The third loop iterates through the string `s` again.
     - Depending on whether the current character is '>' or '<', it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
     - The calculations involve using the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to account for the movements and inversions of the pinball.
     - The results are printed for each cell.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell in the string `s`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes the string `s` to compute the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. The use of cumulative counts and indices ensures that the calculations are efficient and accurate.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
