### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums for a permutation.
   - We need to determine the number of possible permutations that could have these indices as their prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function appears to be implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity.
     - If \(b = 0\), it returns \((1, 0)\).
     - If \(a < b\), it swaps \(a\) and \(b\) and calls itself recursively.
     - If \(a \% b = 0\), it returns \((1, -(a // b - 1))\).
     - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with \(b\) and \(a \% b\) and adjusts the results.
   - **func_2(a, b)**: This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of \(a\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - It calls `func_1(b, 1000000007)` to get the coefficients.
     - It returns \(c \times a \mod 1000000007\).

3. **Evaluating the Functions**:
   - **func_1**: The implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm is correct. It correctly handles the base cases and recursive calls.
   - **func_2**: The function correctly computes the modular inverse using the result from `func_1`. However, it seems to be missing the actual logic to count the number of valid permutations.

4. **Missing Logic**:
   - The provided functions do not directly address the problem of counting the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The problem requires a more complex algorithm to count the permutations, which is not present in the provided code.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions are mathematically correct for their intended purpose (Extended Euclidean Algorithm and modular inverse), but they do not solve the problem of counting the number of valid permutations. Therefore, the given program is incorrect for the specified problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
