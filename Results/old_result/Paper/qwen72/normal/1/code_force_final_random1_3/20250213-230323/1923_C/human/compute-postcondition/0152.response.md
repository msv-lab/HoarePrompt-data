Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a list of integers and a set of queries. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `m`. It then reads a list of `n` integers. The function computes two cumulative lists: one for the sum of the elements (`p`) and another for the count of 1s (`c`). For each query, it checks if the segment of the list meets a specific condition and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. After processing all test cases and their queries, the function has no return value but has printed the results for each query. **
