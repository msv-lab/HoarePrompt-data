To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object `l`, which is the only object in the loop head (`for x in l:`). The loop will execute if `l` contains at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `n` and `m` are integers read from input
- `l` is a list of integers read from input
- `p` is a list containing the single element 0
- `c` is a list containing the single element 0
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 0

We need to ensure that `l` has at least one element for the loop to execute. Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect this requirement.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `p` is a list containing the single element 0, `c` is a list containing the single element 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
