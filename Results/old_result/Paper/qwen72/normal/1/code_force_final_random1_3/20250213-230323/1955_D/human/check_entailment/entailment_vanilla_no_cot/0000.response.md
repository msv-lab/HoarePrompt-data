Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It processes each test case by:

1. Reading the input values for `n`, `m`, and `k`.
2. Reading the arrays `a` and `b`.
3. Using a frequency array `cnt_b` to count the occurrences of each element in `b`.
4. Initializing a counter `curr` to keep track of the number of matches between the current subsegment of `a` and `b`.
5. Iterating through the array `a` to check each subsegment of length `m`:
   - For the initial subsegment, it updates `curr` based on the matches.
   - For subsequent subsegments, it updates `curr` by removing the effect of the element that is sliding out of the window and adding the effect of the new element that is sliding into the window.
6. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.
7. After processing all subsegments, it prints the value of `ans`.

The program also resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the next test case by iterating over the unique elements in `b_values`. This ensures that the frequency array is correctly reset for each new test case.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program appears to be correct and should work efficiently within the given limits.
