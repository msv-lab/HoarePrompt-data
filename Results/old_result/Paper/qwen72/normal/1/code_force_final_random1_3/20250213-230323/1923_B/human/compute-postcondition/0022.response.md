Output State: **`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`; `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is reduced by `delta`; `rest` is now `rest - delta`; `pos` is `pos + 1`. All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, `distance`) retain their previous values, and `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`.**
