Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with new values assigned by `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `l` is the length of the binary string `b`. `k` is not equal to 1. `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 up to 2^(lk-2), followed by the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and now also includes `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1`. `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk` and must be at least 2, `i` is lk-2.**
