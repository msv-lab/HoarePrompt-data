Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 < t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the values of `missing` (one more value added), `n` is the first element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `m` is the second element of the tuple at index `_` in `test_cases`, `a` is a non-empty list, `freq` is a list of 7 zeros except the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` which is now 2, `missing` is the sum of the differences between `m` and each frequency in `freq` where the frequency is less than `m`, `prob` is the next element in `a` after the current one.** 

Explanation: The code increments the value at the index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` in the list `freq` by 1. Since `freq` initially had a 1 at the index `ord(prob) - ord('A')`, it now has a 2 at that index. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
