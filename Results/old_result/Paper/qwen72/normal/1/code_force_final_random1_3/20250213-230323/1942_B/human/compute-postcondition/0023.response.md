Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None`. `mex` is the smallest value among `t - ar[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes `res` to a list of `n` elements, all set to `None`.
- The values of `_`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, and `mex` remain unchanged.
- The new state of `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None`.
