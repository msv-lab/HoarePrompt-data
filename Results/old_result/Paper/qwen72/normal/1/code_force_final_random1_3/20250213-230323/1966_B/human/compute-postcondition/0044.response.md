Let's break down the initial state and the logic to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `tc` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `ans` is 'YES'.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `gr[0][0]` is different from `gr[n-1][m-1]`, then:
     - `j` is `m-2`.
     - `ans` is 'NO'.
     - If `impossible` is `True`, the program maintains all these conditions.
   - If `impossible` is `False`, the program also maintains all these conditions, but `impossible` is `False`, indicating that at least one pair of consecutive strings in `gr` has a different first character or a different last character.
   - If `gr[0][0]` is the same as `gr[n-1][m-1]`, then the program maintains the original conditions with `ans` still being 'YES'.

3. **Determine the Value of `ans`:**
   - The key condition here is whether `gr[0][0]` is the same as `gr[n-1][m-1]`.
   - If they are different, `ans` is set to 'NO'.
   - If they are the same, `ans` remains 'YES'.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(ans)` will output the value of `ans`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the value of `ans` will be either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether `gr[0][0]` is the same as `gr[n-1][m-1]`.

Output: **ans (where ans is 'YES' if gr[0][0] is the same as gr[n-1][m-1], and 'NO' if they are different)**
