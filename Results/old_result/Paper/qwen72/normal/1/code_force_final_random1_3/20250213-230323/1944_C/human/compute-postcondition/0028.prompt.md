Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5). `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`. `start` is 0. `vis` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
while nums.get(start, 0):
    vis.add(start)
    nums[start] -= 1
    if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
        nums[start + 1] -= 1
        start += 1
    else:
        print(start + 1)
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5). `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `nums[0]` is now `nums[0] - 1`. `start` is 1. `vis` is a set containing the element 0. `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5). `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `nums[0]` is now `nums[0] - 1`. `start` is 1. `vis` is a set containing the elements 0 and 1. `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - 1` and must be greater than 0. If `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is true, `start` is updated to 2, and `nums[2]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, the program does not return any value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`arr` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ `arr[i]` < len(`arr`), and the length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5). `nums` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`. `nums[0]` is now `nums[0] - 1`. If `start` is 1, `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - 2`. If `start` is 2, `nums[2]` is now `nums[2] - 2`. If `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is true, then `nums[start + 1]` is now `nums[start + 1] - 1` and `start` is now either 2 or 3. The set `vis` contains the elements 0 and 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
