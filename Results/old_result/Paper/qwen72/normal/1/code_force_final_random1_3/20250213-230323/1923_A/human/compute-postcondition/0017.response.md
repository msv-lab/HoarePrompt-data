Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string containing the new input with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string of the new `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of the new `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `arr` is updated to a new string that contains the input provided by the user with all spaces removed.
- The values of `_`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, but their definitions now depend on the new value of `arr`.
