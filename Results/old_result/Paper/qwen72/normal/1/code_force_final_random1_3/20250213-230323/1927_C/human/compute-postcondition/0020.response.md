Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. Furthermore, either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`. The current value of `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`.** 

Explanation: The value of `bOnes` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
