Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `a`, `cnt` is 1 + math.floor(x / 2) if `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` are all equal and odd, otherwise `cnt` is math.floor(x / 2)**

Explanation:
- `cnt` is incremented by `math.floor(x / 2)`.
- If `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` are all equal and odd, `cnt` was initially 1, so now it is `1 + math.floor(x / 2)`.
- If `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` are not all equal and odd, `cnt` was initially 0, so now it is `math.floor(x / 2)`.
- The values of `int(input())`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.
