Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then recombined to form a new rectangle that is not identical to the original (considering rotations).

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle**:
   - If both dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) are even, we can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and recombine them to form a new rectangle. For example, a \(4 \times 6\) rectangle can be cut into two \(4 \times 3\) rectangles and recombined to form a \(6 \times 4\) rectangle.
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is odd, the problem becomes more complex. We need to check if the other dimension is at least twice the odd dimension. For example, a \(2 \times 6\) rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and recombined to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.

3. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - It checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are even and prints 'yes' if true.
   - It then checks some conditions involving the differences between \(a\) and \(b\), but these conditions are not clear and do not seem to correctly handle all cases.

4. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0` is correct for the case where both dimensions are even.
   - The conditions `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` and `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` are incorrect and do not make logical sense in the context of the problem.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, the answer is 'yes'.
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is odd, we need to check if the other dimension is at least twice the odd dimension. For example, a \(2 \times 6\) rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and recombined to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.

Given the issues in the logic, the program is incorrect. The conditions involving the differences between \(a\) and \(b\) are not correctly formulated to solve the problem.

Final: **False**
