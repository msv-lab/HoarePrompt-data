Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `score` is now equal to the sum of the first, third, and fifth elements of `l`, `i` is 4, and the loop has `n - 2` iterations remaining.**

Explanation:
- The code `score += l[i]` adds the value of `l[4]` (the fifth element of the list `l`) to the current value of `score`.
- Initially, `score` was the sum of the first and third elements of `l`.
- After executing the code, `score` is now the sum of the first, third, and fifth elements of `l`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, and the number of remaining loop iterations remain unchanged.
