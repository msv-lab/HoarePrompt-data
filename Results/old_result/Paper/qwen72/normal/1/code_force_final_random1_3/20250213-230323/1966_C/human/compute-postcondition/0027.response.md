Output State: **`tc` is an input integer where 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4 - 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `dp` is `True` if any difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is 0) is greater than 1, otherwise `dp` is `False`.**

### Explanation:
- **`tc` and `t`**: These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: This variable remains unchanged as it is only used to define the range of the loop and is not modified within the loop.
- **`arr`**: This list remains unchanged as it is only accessed but not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n - 1` because the loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`.
- **`dp`**: The value of `dp` after the loop completes depends on whether any difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is 0) is greater than 1. If any such difference exists, `dp` will be `True`; otherwise, `dp` will be `False`.
