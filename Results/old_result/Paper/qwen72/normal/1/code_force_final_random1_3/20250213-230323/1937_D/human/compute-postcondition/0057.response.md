Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s`. The list `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters. The list `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`. The list `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters. The list `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order. The variable `j` is `n`, and the variable `i` is `-1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n` times, with `j` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
- For each iteration, `i` starts from `n-1` and decrements to 0.
- If the character at position `i` in `s` is '<', the lists `B` and `idx_B` are updated to include the current index and the calculated value.
- After all iterations, `B` will contain the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
- `idx_B` will contain the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
- The variable `j` will be `n` after the loop completes, and `i` will be `-1` because it is decremented one more time after the last valid index.
