The function `solve()` is called without any arguments. Since the function definition is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the variables or the state of the program. However, based on the initial state, we can infer that `solve()` might interact with the variables `n`, `k`, and `edges`, and possibly perform operations related to the tree structure defined by these variables.

Since the function's implementation is unknown, we cannot specify the exact changes to the variables. However, we can state that the function has been called and might have modified the state of the program in some way.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a positive integer less than `n` representing the number of edges to be removed, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(v, u)` represents an edge between vertices `v` and `u`, with `1 ≤ v, u ≤ n`. The function `solve()` has been called, and its effects on the state are unknown.**
