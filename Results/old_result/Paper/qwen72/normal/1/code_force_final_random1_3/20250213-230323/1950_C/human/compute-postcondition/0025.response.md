The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('12', end='')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` function is used to output text to the console.
- The first argument to the `print` function is the string `'12'`.
- The `end` parameter is set to an empty string `''`, which means that after printing `'12'`, no newline character will be added. This will cause any subsequent print statements to appear on the same line.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 3 ≤ t ≤ 1442.
- `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
- `h` is the substring of `s` from index 0 to 1 (inclusive), which represents the hours part of the time.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement does not depend on the initial state variables `t`, `s`, or `h`.
- The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'12'` to the console without adding a newline character.

### Output:
Output: **12**
