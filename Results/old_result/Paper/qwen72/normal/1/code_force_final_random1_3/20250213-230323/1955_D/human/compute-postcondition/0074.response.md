The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The initial value of `ans` is determined by the conditions specified in the initial state. If `curr` is less than `k`, `ans` is 0; otherwise, `ans` is 1. After the code snippet is executed, `ans` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the output state is:

- If `curr` is less than `k`, `ans` was initially 0 and is now 1.
- If `curr` is not less than `k`, `ans` was initially 1 and is now 2.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than `m`, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ m, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `curr` is the number of elements in `a[:m]` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative. If `curr` is less than `k`, `ans` is 1; otherwise, `ans` is 2.**
