Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `d1[3]` is either 2 or `l[2] - l[1] + 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `d1[4]` is `l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes `d1` being a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0, and `d1[2]` is set to 1.
- The value of `d1[3]` is determined based on the condition given in the initial state. It is either 2 or `l[2] - l[1] + 1`.
- The code snippet updates `d1[i + 2]` (which is `d1[4]`) to be `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, this translates to `d1[4] = l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`.
- All other conditions and values in the initial state remain unchanged.
