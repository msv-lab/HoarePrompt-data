Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `q` is 0, `i` is 3, and `i` must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`. If `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, then `ans` is updated to 3 if `i` is greater than the initial value of `ans`; otherwise, `ans` remains the same. If the condition is not met, `ans` remains 1.***
