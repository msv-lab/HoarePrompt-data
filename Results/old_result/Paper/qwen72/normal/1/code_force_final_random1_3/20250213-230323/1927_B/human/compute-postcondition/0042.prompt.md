Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the length of the lost string. a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, representing the trace of the string. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    l = int(input())
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    alp = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm',
        'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
    rev_array = array[::-1]
    ans = []
    for j in range(l):
        ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
    print(''.join(map(str, ans)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers derived from the input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list of length `l` where each element corresponds to the letter in `alp` based on the count of the respective element in `rev_array` starting from that index, `j` is `l-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list containing `l` elements where each element is the letter corresponding to the count of the respective element in `rev_array` minus 1 in the alphabet, `j` is `l-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list of characters where each character corresponds to the count of the respective element in `rev_array` minus 1, mapped to the alphabet, `j` is `l`, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
