To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `tc` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is `m - 1`.
- `ans` is 'YES'.
- If `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range `range(n - 1)`, which means `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `n - 2`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`, so `n` must be greater than 2.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is 2, `j` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 'YES'. If `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.**
