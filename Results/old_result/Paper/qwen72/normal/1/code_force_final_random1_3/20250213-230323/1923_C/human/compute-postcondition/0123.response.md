The value of `i` is `3 * x`, and `p` is initially `[0, x, 2 * x]`. The code appends `i` to the list `p`. Therefore, the new value of `p` is `[0, x, 2 * x, 3 * x]`.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Specifically, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers read from user input that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `l`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged. If `x` is 1, then `c` is `[0, 2, 2]` and `j` is 3. Otherwise, if `x` is not 1, then `c` is `[0, 0, 0]` and `j` is 1.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from user input, `l` is a list of integers read from user input that must have at least 3 elements, `p` is `[0, x, 2 * x, 3 * x]`, `i` is `3 * x`, `x` is the third element of `l`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged. If `x` is 1, then `c` is `[0, 2, 2]` and `j` is 3. Otherwise, if `x` is not 1, then `c` is `[0, 0, 0]` and `j` is 1.**
