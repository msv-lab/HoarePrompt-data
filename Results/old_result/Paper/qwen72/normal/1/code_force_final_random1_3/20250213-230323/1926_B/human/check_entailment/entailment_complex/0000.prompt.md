Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the size of the grid. Each grid is represented by a list of n strings, each string containing n characters ('0' or '1'). The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')
        
    #State: The loop counter `i` is equal to `a`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `k` is a list that may contain multiple counts of '1's from each input string `b` that contained at least one '1' during the iterations. The variable `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` remains an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, and the grid remains a list of `n` strings, each string containing `n` characters ('0' or '1'). The grid still contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'. The variable `a` is now 0, as it has been decremented by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a grid of `n` x `n` characters ('0' or '1'). It then determines and prints whether the shape formed by the '1's in the grid is a 'SQUARE' or a 'TRIANGLE'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the program state is such that all input has been processed and the appropriate shape for each test case has been printed. The original values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the grid retains its initial configuration.
