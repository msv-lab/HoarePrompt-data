Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program indeed does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The program sorts the array and then prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is not the same as calculating the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. This approach only works by coincidence for some specific test cases but fails in general. The correct approach involves sorting the array and then computing the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, as outlined in the corrected implementation provided in the original assessment.

Final: **False**
