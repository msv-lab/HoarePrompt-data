The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ai` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `ai` will take the value of the first element in the list `a`.

For the loop to execute, the list `a` must have at least one element, and `ai` should be the first element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `year` is 0, `ai` is the first element in the list `a`**
