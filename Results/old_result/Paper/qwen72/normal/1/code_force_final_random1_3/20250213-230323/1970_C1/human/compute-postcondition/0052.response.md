The only objects in the loop head are `neighbor` and `tree[current]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the number of neighbors in `tree[current]`. If there are more neighbors left to iterate over, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `tree[current]` must contain at least two neighbors, and `neighbor` was the second neighbor in `tree[current]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `tree[current]` must still contain at least one more neighbor (making it at least three neighbors in total initially). The next `neighbor` to be considered would be the third neighbor in `tree[current]`.

State: **`tree[current]` must contain at least three neighbors, and `neighbor` is the third neighbor in `tree[current]`.**
