The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value `v` to the list located at index `u` in the `u2vs` list. Given the initial conditions, `u` is the first integer provided as input minus 2, and `v` is the second integer provided as input minus 2. The list at index `u` already contains the value `v`, and the list at index `v` already includes the value `u`.

After executing the code, the list at index `u` in `u2vs` will contain the value `v` one more time, making it appear twice in the list.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to `n`, the list at index `u` now contains the value `v` twice, the list at index `v` in `u2vs` now includes the value `u` appended to it, `u` is the first integer provided as input minus 2, `v` is the second integer provided as input minus 2.**
