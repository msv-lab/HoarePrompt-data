You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `a` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, computes a value `z` based on these inputs, and prints `z`. The computation of `z` involves adjusting its value based on a condition involving `m`, which is derived from `y` and `x`. After processing all test cases, the function has printed a result for each one, and the state of the program includes the processed values of `a`, `x`, `y`, and `z` for each iteration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the calculation of `m` and the subsequent condition check. Specifically, the variable `a` is used in the condition `if m < a:` which is incorrect because `a` represents the number of test cases, not the number of available cells on the screen. This will lead to incorrect results for certain inputs.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
15 0
```
Here, `x = 15` and `y = 0`. The program calculates:
- `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
- `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`

Then it checks:
- `if 0 < 15:` which is true, so it executes:
- `z = 0 + (15 - 0 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 0 + 15 // 15 = 1`

The program outputs `1`, but the correct output should be `1` since 15 icons of size 1x1 can fit into a single screen (15 cells).

However, for another input:
```
1
16 0
```
The program calculates:
- `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
- `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`

Then it checks:
- `if 0 < 16:` which is true, so it executes:
- `z = 0 + (16 - 0 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 0 + 16 // 15 = 1`

The program outputs `1`, but the correct output should be `2` since 16 icons of size 1x1 cannot fit into a single screen (only 15 cells are available).

Thus, the program does not handle this case correctly, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
