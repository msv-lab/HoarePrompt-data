To determine what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement is executed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
   - `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new `s`.
     - If `len(a) == 2`, the set `a` contains exactly 2 unique characters.
     - Otherwise, the number of unique characters in `a` is not equal to 2.
   - `b` is a string formed by sorting the characters in the new `s` alphabetically.
   - `c` is a string formed by sorting the characters in the new `s` in reverse alphabetical order.
   - If the new `s` is already sorted in alphabetical order, then `s` is equal to `b`.
   - Otherwise, `s` is not equal to `b`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains the line `print('YES')`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `s`, `a`, `b`, or `c`, the `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
