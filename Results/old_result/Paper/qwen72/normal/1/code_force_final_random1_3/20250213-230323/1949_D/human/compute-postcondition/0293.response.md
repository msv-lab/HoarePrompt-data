Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but reads an input consisting of n lines, each containing n characters representing transitions between scenarios. The characters can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (no transition). The function processes this input and returns a result based on the transitions, ensuring that at most 2 * floor(n / 2) characters are 'F' or 'S'.**
