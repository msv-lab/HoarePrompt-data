The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The initial values of `n` and `m` are overwritten by the new values provided by the input. The other variables (`t`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the input integers, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
