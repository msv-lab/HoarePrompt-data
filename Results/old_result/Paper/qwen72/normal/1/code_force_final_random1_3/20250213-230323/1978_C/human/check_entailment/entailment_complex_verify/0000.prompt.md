You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), k is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12).
def func_1(n, k):

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `c` will be the number of iterations the loop has run, which is `(n + 1) // 2`. The value of `k` will be reduced by the sum of the series of odd numbers from `n` down to 1 (or 0 if `n` is even), and then incremented by the number of iterations. The list `l` will be the result of applying `func_3` to the initial list `n` times, once for each iteration. The loop will terminate when `i` becomes -1, and the final value of `i` will be -1. If `k` becomes 0 during the loop, the function will return the current state of `l`. If `k` becomes less than `i - 1` during the loop, the function will return the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, and `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000. It modifies `k` by dividing it by 2 and initializes a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n`. The function iterates over a range starting from `n` down to 0, decrementing by 2 in each step. During each iteration, it increments a counter `c` and checks conditions involving `k` and the current iteration index `i`. Depending on these conditions, the function may return the list `l`, call `func_2` with specific arguments, or update `l` using `func_3`. The final state of the program is determined by the value of `k` and the number of iterations completed. If `k` becomes 0, the function returns the current state of `l`. If `k` becomes less than `i - 1`, the function returns the result of `func_2`. Otherwise, it continues to update `k` and `l` until the loop completes, at which point it returns the final state of `l` or the result of `func_2` or `func_3`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c and k are non-negative integers, l is a list of integers of length at least c + k.
def func_2(c, k, l):
    x, y = l[-c], l[-c - k]

    return l
    #The program returns the list `l` which is a list of integers of length at least `c + k`. The elements at indices `-c - k` and `-c` in `l` are `x` and `y`, respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `c`, `k`, and `l`. It swaps the elements at the positions `-c` and `-c - k` in the list `l` and returns the modified list. After the function executes, the list `l` has its elements at indices `-c` and `-c - k` swapped, while the rest of the list remains unchanged. The function ensures that the list `l` is of length at least `c + k`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a positive integer, l is a list of integers of length at least 2*c.
def func_3(c, l):
    x, y = l[-c], l[c - 1]
    l[c - 1], l[-c] = x, y
    return l
    #The program returns the list `l` where the elements at indices `c - 1` and `-c` have been swapped. The list `l` is of length at least 2*c, and `c` is a positive integer. The element originally at index `c - 1` is now at index `-c`, and the element originally at index `-c` is now at index `c - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a positive integer `c` and a list `l` of integers with a length of at least 2*c. It swaps the elements at indices `c - 1` and `-c` in the list `l`. After the function executes, the list `l` is returned with these two elements swapped. The element originally at index `c - 1` is now at index `-c`, and the element originally at index `-c` is now at index `c - 1`.

    #State: *`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= `k` <= 10^12, and `k` is even. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is set to `n`. If `n` is even, `max_k` is set to `n`. Additionally, `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    return n, k
    #The program returns the values of `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `k` is an even integer between 0 and 10^12. Additionally, `max_k` is set to `n` (regardless of whether `n` is odd or even), and `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads two integers `n` and `k` from user input. It returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd or if `k` exceeds a calculated maximum value (`max_k`) based on `n`. If these conditions are not met, it returns the original values of `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `k` is an even integer between 0 and 10^12. The maximum value `max_k` is determined based on whether `n` is odd or even.

    print()
    #This is printed: (a newline character)
    return
    #The program returns nothing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a list `l` of integers representing a permutation of length `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` in the order they appear, separated by spaces. After printing all elements, it prints a newline character. The function does not return any value.

    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_5(l)
    return
    #The program does not return any value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It retrieves two integers `n` and `k` from the function `func_4`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `k`, and then passes the result to `func_5`. The function does not modify any global state and does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Handling of Odd `k` Values**: The function `func_4` checks if `k` is odd and returns `(0, 0)` if it is. However, this is incorrect because the problem does not state that `k` must be even. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 4`, the permutation `[3, 1, 2]` is valid, but the program would incorrectly return "NO".

2. **Maximum `k` Calculation**: The maximum `k` value is calculated differently for even and odd `n`. This calculation is not correct. For example, for `n = 4`, the maximum `k` should be 6 (achieved by the permutation `[4, 1, 2, 3]`), but the program calculates it as 8.

3. **Permutation Generation Logic**: The logic in `func_1` and `func_3` for generating the permutation is flawed. It does not always produce a valid permutation that meets the required `k` value. For example, for `n = 4` and `k = 6`, the program might not generate a valid permutation.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, for `n = 1` and `k = 0`, the program should return the permutation `[1]`, but it might not handle this case correctly.

These issues indicate that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
