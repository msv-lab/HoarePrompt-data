The function `func_4` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided cases, it seems to internally handle two integer values, `n` and `k`, under certain conditions. 

- Case_1: The function returns `(0, 0)`.
- Case_2: The function returns `0, 0`.
- Case_3: The function returns the values of `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `k` is an even integer between 0 and 10^12. Additionally, `max_k` is set to `n` (regardless of whether `n` is odd or even), and `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Given that Case_1 and Case_2 both return `(0, 0)` or `0, 0` (which are effectively the same), and Case_3 specifies the conditions under which `n` and `k` are returned, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function returns `(0, 0)` unless specific internal conditions are met, in which case it returns the values of `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `k` is an even integer between 0 and 10^12, with `max_k` set to `n` and `max_k` being greater than or equal to `k`.**
