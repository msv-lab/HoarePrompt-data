Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `i` is `n - 2`. `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. `l` is a list of integers from user input. `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0. `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 where `d2[n - 1]` is 1. The difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is less than the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`.**
