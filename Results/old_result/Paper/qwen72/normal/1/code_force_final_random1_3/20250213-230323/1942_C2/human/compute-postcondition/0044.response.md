The provided Python code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. This operation updates the values of these variables based on the new input.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9)
- `x` is the second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5))
- `y` is the third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x)
- `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers within the range [1, n]
- `tt` must be greater than 1
- `ii` is 1
- `i` is `x - 1`
- `tmp` is a list containing the middle points of all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose differences are even and where `y` was sufficient to cover the additional positions
- `ans` is the final value after all the updates based on the conditions in the loop plus `y`

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` is updated to the first integer from the input
- `x` is updated to the second integer from the input
- `y` is updated to the third integer from the input

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers within the range [1, n], `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is `x - 1`, `tmp` is a list containing the middle points of all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose differences are even and where `y` was sufficient to cover the additional positions, `ans` is the final value after all the updates based on the conditions in the loop plus `y`.**
