Output State: **`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `da` is an integer key present in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `tmp` is the minimum value between the original `tmp` (1000000000) and the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0, `rank[da - 1]` is now `tmp + 1`. The length of the list `d[da]` remains greater than 1.**
