Postcondition: **If the first character of `s` is '0': `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 100, `one` is 0, `one_perc` is `n * 100 // (n - 1)`. If the first character of `s` is not '0': `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is 100. Additionally, `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50.**
