Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (this variable is also not used in the code snippet).
   - `a` is a new input integer greater than 0 (this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `s` is a new input string.
   - `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`.
   - `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(x + y)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The code snippet prints the sum of `x` and `y`.
   - `x` is the count of occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`.
   - `y` is the count of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`.

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `x` and `y`. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **x + y (where x is the number of times 'map' appears in the string s, and y is the number of times 'pie' appears in the string s)**
