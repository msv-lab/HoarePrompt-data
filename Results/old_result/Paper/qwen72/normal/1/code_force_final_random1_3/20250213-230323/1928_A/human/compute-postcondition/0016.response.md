The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are now the positive integers provided by the input. The other variables (`t` and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` and `b` are updated to the positive integers provided by the input, `i` is 1.**
