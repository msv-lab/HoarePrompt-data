Postcondition: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 1. If `s[0]` is '0', then `zero` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[i]` is '0' or '1', respectively, and `one` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is '0' or '1', respectively. If `s[0]` is '1', then `zero` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is '0' or '1', respectively, and `one` is 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[i]` is '0' or '1', respectively. `zero_perc` is 100 if `s[0]` is '0' and `s[i]` is '0', or 0 if `s[0]` is '1' and `s[i]` is '1'. `one_perc` is \((o - \text{one}) \times 100 // (n - 1)\). If `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is [1]; otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.**
