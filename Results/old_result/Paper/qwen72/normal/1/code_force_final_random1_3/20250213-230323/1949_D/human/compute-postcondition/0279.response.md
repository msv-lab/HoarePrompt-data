The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `nx`, we can only say that `nx` is updated to include an additional 'S' at the end.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged, `i` is `n + 1`, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'S'.**
