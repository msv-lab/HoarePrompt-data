Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `_` is 0.
2. `m` is greater than 0.
3. `a` and `b` are input integers.
4. `i` is defined as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
5. `s` is defined as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
6. The condition states that either `(b - a + 1) <= 1` or `s - (b - a + 1) < i`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the `print` statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. The conditions provided do not affect the content of the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement is a simple command that outputs a fixed string.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
