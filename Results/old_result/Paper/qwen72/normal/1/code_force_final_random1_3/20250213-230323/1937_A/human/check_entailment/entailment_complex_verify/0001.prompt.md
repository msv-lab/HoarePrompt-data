You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Annotated Code: 
from math import log2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases and the integer n for each test case. For example, the function should be defined as `def find_position_of_one(t, n_list):`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `n_list` is a list of integers representing the length of the array a for each test case (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: `i` is `n_cases - 1`, `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the value of `n` remains 1. If `n` is greater than or equal to `power - 1`, then if `power` equals `n`, `power` remains `n + 1`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `n`, and `power` is not equal to `n + 1`. If `n` is not 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer. If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` and prints that value. The function does not return any values; it only prints results to standard output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We start with an array \( a \) where \( a_i = i \) for \( 1 \le i \le n \).
   - We perform the operation `swap(i)` for each \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).
   - The `swap(i)` operation swaps \( a_d \) and \( a_i \), where \( d \) is the largest divisor of \( i \) that is not equal to \( i \) itself.
   - We need to find the position of 1 in the resulting array after all swaps.

2. **Analyzing the Swap Operation:**
   - For a number \( i \), the largest divisor \( d \) is \( \frac{i}{2} \) if \( i \) is even, and it is less than \( \frac{i}{2} \) if \( i \) is odd.
   - When \( i \) is a power of 2, the largest divisor \( d \) is \( \frac{i}{2} \), and the swap will move the element at position \( \frac{i}{2} \) to position \( i \).

3. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - If \( n \) is a power of 2, the final position of 1 will be \( 2^{\text{log}_2(n)} \).
   - If \( n \) is not a power of 2, the final position of 1 will be \( 2^{\text{log}_2(n) - 1} \).

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \).
   - If \( n \) is 1, it prints 1.
   - Otherwise, it calculates \( \text{log}_2(n) \) and determines the power of 2.
   - If \( n \) is exactly a power of 2, it prints \( 2^{\text{log}_2(n)} \).
   - If \( n \) is not a power of 2, it prints \( 2^{\text{log}_2(n) - 1} \).

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case when \( n = 1 \).
   - The logic for calculating the position of 1 based on whether \( n \) is a power of 2 or not is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above.
