The code snippet `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `i + 1` is 1. This means that 1 is appended to `lst`.

The rest of the variables (`n`, `zero`, `zero_perc`, `one`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the first character of `s` and the values of `zero_perc` and `one_perc` also remain valid.

Output State: **If the first character of `s` is '0': `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 100, `one` is 0, `one_perc` is `n * 100 // (n - 1)`, `lst` is [1]. If the first character of `s` is not '0': `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is 100, `lst` is [1]. Additionally, `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50.**
