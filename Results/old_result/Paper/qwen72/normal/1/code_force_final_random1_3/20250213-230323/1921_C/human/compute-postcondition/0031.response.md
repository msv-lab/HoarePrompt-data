Output State: **`i` is `feat[0]`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `array2` contains the values `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * a` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where the condition `arr[j] - arr[j-1] < b / a` is true.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]` reads a space-separated list of integers from the user and assigns it to the variable `arr`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `test_cases`, and `array2`) remain unchanged.
- The initial conditions for `i`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `test_cases` are still valid.
- The condition for `array2` remains the same, but now `arr` is updated to the new list of integers provided by the user.
