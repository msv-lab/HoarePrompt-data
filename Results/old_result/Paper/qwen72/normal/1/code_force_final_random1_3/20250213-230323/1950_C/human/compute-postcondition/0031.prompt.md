Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, where hh is the hour (00 to 23) and mm is the minute (00 to 59).
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    h = s[:2]
    if h == '00':
        print('12', end='')
    elif int(h) <= 12:
        print(h, end='')
    else:
        print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
    print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is the user input string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `h` is the substring of `s` from index 0 to 1 (inclusive), and the input to the loop must be a positive integer. If `h` is '00', the program follows the logic for the if part. If `h` is not '00' and the integer value of `h` is less than or equal to 12, the program follows the logic for the if part. Otherwise, if the integer value of `h` is greater than 12, the program follows the logic for the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1441, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, and `h` is the substring of `s` from index 0 to 1 (inclusive), which represents the hours part of the time. If `h` is '00', the program continues with the current values of `t`, `s`, and `h`. If `h` is not '00' and `int(h) <= 12`, the program continues with the current values of `t`, `s`, and `h`. Otherwise, if `int(h) > 12`, the program continues with the same values of `t`, `s`, and `h`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 3 ≤ t ≤ 1442, `s` is a new input string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, and `h` is the substring of `s` from index 0 to 1 (inclusive), which represents the hours part of the time. If `h` is '00', the program continues with the same values for `t`, `s`, and `h`. If `h` is not '00' and `int(h) <= 12`, the program continues with the same values for `t`, `s`, and `h`. Otherwise, if `int(h) > 12`, the program continues with the same values for `t`, `s`, and `h`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
