Output State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `b` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
