Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It processes the input to precompute prefix sums (`p`) and the count of ones (`c`) up to each position in the array. For each query, it checks if the subarray defined by the query indices is "good" according to the problem's criteria. Specifically, it verifies if the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is at least the number of ones in the subarray, which ensures that it's possible to construct a corresponding `b` array that meets all the conditions specified in the problem statement. The logic and implementation align with the requirements, making the solution correct.
