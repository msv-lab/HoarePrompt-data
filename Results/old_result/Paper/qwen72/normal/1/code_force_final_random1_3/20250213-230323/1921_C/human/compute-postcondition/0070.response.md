To determine what will be printed by the `print('Yes')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is `feat[0]`.
   - `f` is `feat[1]`.
   - `a` is `feat[2]`.
   - `b` is `feat[-1]`.
   - `test_cases` is greater than `n`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `array2` contains the values `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * feat[2]` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[j] - arr[j-1]` is less than `b / a`.
   - The sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - The condition `test_cases > n` indicates that the number of test cases is greater than `n`.
   - The condition for `array2` is that it contains values `(arr[j] - arr[j-1]) * feat[2]` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[j] - arr[j-1]` is less than `b / a`.
   - The final condition is that the sum of all elements in `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`.

Given these conditions, the `print('Yes')` statement will execute if all the conditions are met. Since the conditions are explicitly stated and assumed to be true based on the initial state, the `print('Yes')` statement will indeed print "Yes".

Output: **Yes**
