Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

If `a[l]` is equal to `r - l + 1`, then the state remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` modifies a list `a` and updates a list `ops` based on the values within a specified range `[l, r]` of `a`. If `l` equals `r` and `a[l]` is not zero, it sets `a[l]` to zero and appends the tuple `(l, l)` to `ops`. If `l` is not equal to `r` and `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it sets all elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and appends the tuple `(l, r)` to `ops`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `a` may have been modified, and `ops` may contain additional tuples depending on the conditions met during execution.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `a` of integers and returns a tuple containing the sum of all integers in the list `a`, the integer 0, and an empty list. The function does not modify the input list `a`.

If `pos` is not equal to `r`, a recursive call to `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been initiated. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, a recursive call to `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called.
    #State: *`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`, `a` is a list of integers, and `s` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`. If `s` is less than or equal to the square of the length of the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, then each element from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) in `a` is set to `r - l + 1`, `s` may no longer be the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, and the tuple `(l, r)` is appended to the list `ops`. If `s` is greater than the square of the length of the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, then `s` remains the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, a recursive call to `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been initiated. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, a recursive call to `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `recursive_maximize_sum` takes two non-negative integer parameters `l` and `r` such that `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`, where `a` is a list of integers. It modifies the list `a` and appends tuples to the list `ops`. If the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` is less than or equal to the square of the length of this sublist, it sets all elements in this sublist to the length of the sublist and appends the tuple `(l, r)` to `ops`. Otherwise, it recursively processes the left and right sublists around the maximum element in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`. The function does not return any value.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s, m, ops = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    #This is printed: s, m (where s and m are the first and second values returned by func_2(a), respectively)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is provided by the input and satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7, `s` is the first value returned by `func_2(a)`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2(a)`, and `ops` is an empty list of pairs returned by `func_2(a)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18) and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) from the user input. It then calls another function `func_2` with the list `a` and prints the first two values returned by `func_2`. Additionally, it iterates over a list of pairs returned by `func_2` and prints each pair with their indices incremented by 1. After the function concludes, the input variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and the output consists of the values and pairs printed to the console.
