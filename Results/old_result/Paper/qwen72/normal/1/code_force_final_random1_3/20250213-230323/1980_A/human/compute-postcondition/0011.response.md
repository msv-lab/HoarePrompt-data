The code snippet `freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1` increments the value at the index corresponding to the third character in the string `a` (which is stored in `prob`) in the list `freq`.

Let's break down the impact:

1. **`freq`**: Initially, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is 2 and the rest are 0. After the code executes, the value at this index is incremented by 1, making it 3.

2. **Other Variables**: The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `prob` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string consisting of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G' and must have at least 3 characters, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the element at index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is 3 and the rest are 0, `prob` is the third character in the string `a`.**
