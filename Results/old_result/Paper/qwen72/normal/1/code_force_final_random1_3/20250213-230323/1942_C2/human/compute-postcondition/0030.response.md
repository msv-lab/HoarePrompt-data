Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input with at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, `tmp` is a list, and `ii` is 0. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)`, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`, and `ans` is increased by `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. If none of these conditions are met, the values of `y`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged.***
