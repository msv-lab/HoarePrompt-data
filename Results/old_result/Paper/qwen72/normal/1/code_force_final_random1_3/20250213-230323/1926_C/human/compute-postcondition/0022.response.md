The code snippet `pd[i] += pd[i - 1]` updates the value of `pd[i]` by adding the value of `pd[i - 1]` to it. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 3
- `j` is `'2'`
- `N` must be greater than 3
- `pd[2]` is now `pd[2] + pd[1] + 2 * len(str(i))`

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. **`i` is 3**: This means the code will update `pd[3]`.
2. **`pd[i] += pd[i - 1]`**: This translates to `pd[3] += pd[2]`.

Since `pd[2]` was previously updated to `pd[2] + pd[1] + 2 * len(str(i))`, we need to consider this value when updating `pd[3]`.

- `len(str(i))` is `len('3')`, which is 1.
- Therefore, `2 * len(str(i))` is `2 * 1`, which is 2.
- So, `pd[2]` is now `pd[2] + pd[1] + 2`.

Thus, the new value of `pd[3]` will be the original value of `pd[3]` plus `pd[2] + pd[1] + 2`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is `'2'`, `N` must be greater than 3, `pd[2]` is `pd[2] + pd[1] + 2`, `pd[3]` is `pd[3] + pd[2] + pd[1] + 2`.**
