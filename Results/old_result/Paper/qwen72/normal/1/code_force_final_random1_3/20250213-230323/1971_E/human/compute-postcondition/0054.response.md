To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `l` and `q`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `l` was incremented by 1.
- `q` must be greater than the new value of `l`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Current State of `l`**: After the previous iteration, `l` was incremented by 1. Therefore, if `l` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it is now `x + 1`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute again if `l < q`. Since `l` is now `x + 1`, the condition for the loop to execute one more time is `x + 1 < q`.

3. **Adjusting `l`**: For the next iteration, `l` will be incremented by 1 again. Therefore, the new value of `l` will be `x + 2`.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must still be less than `q`. Thus, `x + 2 < q`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `l` (now `l + 1`), `m` (now `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`), `i` (now 1), `s` (index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order), `ql` (decremented by `a[s - 1]`). `q` must be greater than the new value of `l`.**

Simplified:
State: **`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `l` (now `l + 1`), `m` (now `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`), `i` (now 1), `s` (index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order), `ql` (decremented by `a[s - 1]`). `q` must be greater than `l + 1`.**
