Postcondition: **`n` remains the same as the initial input integer, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to `n`. Each sublist in `u2vs` contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index. The connections are bidirectional. The variable `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes as calculated by the `bfs` function. The variable `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node. The variable `a` is assigned the result of the function `func_1(d)`. The variable `b` is also assigned the result of the function `func_1(d)`. The variable `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`. The variable `n` is now the value of `previous[b]`, and `n` is -1.**
