Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers with at least one element, `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, `tem` is equal to `arr[len(arr) - 1]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value of `tem` (which is the last element of `arr`) to the list `ans`. Therefore, `ans` now contains one element, which is the last element of `arr`. The values of `arr`, `tem`, and `i` remain unchanged.
