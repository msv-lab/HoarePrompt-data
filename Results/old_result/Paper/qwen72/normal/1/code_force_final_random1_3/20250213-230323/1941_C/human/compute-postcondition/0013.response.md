The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and it is incremented by the `range` function based on the input value `int(input())`. The loop iterates a fixed number of times determined by this input.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, indicating that the loop has just started or is about to start its first iteration (assuming the input was at least 1). For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented to 2, and the total number of iterations allowed by the input must be greater than 1.

Since the input `t` represents the number of iterations the loop should run, and it's given that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in the new `s`, `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`**
