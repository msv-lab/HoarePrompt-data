Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it determines and prints whether 'Alice' or 'Bob' wins based on specific conditions: if the list of unique stone counts does not contain 1 or contains only one unique value, 'Alice' wins. Otherwise, it checks for consecutive unique stone counts with a difference greater than 1; if found, 'Bob' or 'Alice' wins depending on the position of the pair. If no such pair exists, 'Alice' or 'Bob' wins based on the parity of the number of unique stone counts. After processing all test cases, the function ends with `t` set to 0 and other variables reset for each iteration. **
