The code snippet assigns the value of `n` to the variable `mex`. Since `n` is equal to `t`, `mex` will also be equal to `t`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to `None`, `mex` is equal to `t`.**
