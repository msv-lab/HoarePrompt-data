Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is 1, `best` is 1, `res` is `<`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `best` is updated to the current value of `i`, which is 1.
- The value of `k` remains 1 because `i` is 1 and `res` is `<`.
- The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
