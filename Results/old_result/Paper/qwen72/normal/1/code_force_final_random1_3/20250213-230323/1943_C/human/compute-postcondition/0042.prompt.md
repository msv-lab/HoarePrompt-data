Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` remains the same as the initial input integer, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to `n`. Each sublist in `u2vs` contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index. The connections are bidirectional. The variable `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes as calculated by the `bfs` function. The variable `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node. The variable `a` is assigned the result of the function `func_1(d)`. The variable `b` is also assigned the result of the function `func_1(d)`. The variable `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` remains the same as the initial input integer, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to `n`, each sublist contains the indices of the nodes connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index, `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes, `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` and the value of `n`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is now equal to `previous[n]`, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to the original `n`, each sublist contains the indices of the nodes connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index, `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes, `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`, the original value of `n`, and the new value of `n`. If `n` is -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is now equal to `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to the original `n`, each sublist contains the indices of the nodes connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index, `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes, `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`, the original value of `n`, the new value of `n`, and the updated value of `n`. If the new value of `n` is -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
