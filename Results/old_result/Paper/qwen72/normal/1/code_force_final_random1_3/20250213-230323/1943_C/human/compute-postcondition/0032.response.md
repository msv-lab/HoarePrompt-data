For a `while True:` loop, the condition is always true, meaning the loop will continue to execute indefinitely unless there is a break statement within the loop body. Since the loop condition does not depend on any specific state variables, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` remains the same as the initial input integer, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to `n`, each sublist contains the indices of the nodes connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index, `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes, `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` and the value of `n`**
