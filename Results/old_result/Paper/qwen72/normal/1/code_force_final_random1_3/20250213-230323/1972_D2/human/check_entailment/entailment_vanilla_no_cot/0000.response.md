Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` reads the input directly using `input()`, which is not appropriate when handling multiple test cases. The input should be handled in `func_2` and passed to `func_1`.

2. **Loop Conditions**: The loop conditions in `func_1` are not correctly set up to ensure that all valid pairs (a, b) are considered. Specifically, the condition `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m` does not guarantee that `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`.

3. **GCD Calculation**: The GCD calculation is correct, but the logic for counting valid pairs is flawed. The expression `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is not the correct way to count the number of valid pairs.

4. **Output**: The output is printed inside `func_1`, which is not ideal for handling multiple test cases. It would be better to return the result from `func_1` and print it in `func_2`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
            if (b * gcd_ab) % (a + b) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
func_2()
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- Input is handled correctly for multiple test cases.
- All pairs (a, b) within the specified ranges are considered.
- The GCD condition is checked correctly.
- Results are printed after all test cases are processed.
