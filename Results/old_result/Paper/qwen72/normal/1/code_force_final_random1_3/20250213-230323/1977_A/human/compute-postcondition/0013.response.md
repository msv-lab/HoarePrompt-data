Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, and `n` is not equal to `m`.
- `m` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `m` is not equal to `n - 1`.
- Both `m` and `n` are even numbers.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables. It only prints the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
