Reasoning:

The program attempts to solve the problem by reading the input, collecting the count of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1', and then determining the shape based on the first two elements in this collected list (`k`). If the first two elements are equal, it prints "SQUARE"; otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly identify the shapes in all cases. Specifically:

1. **Triangle Identification**: A triangle can be identified by the pattern of increasing or decreasing odd numbers of '1's. The current logic only checks the first two rows, which is insufficient to determine if the pattern continues throughout the entire shape.
   
2. **Square Identification**: A square is identified by having the same number of '1's in each row. The current logic only checks the first two rows, which is also insufficient to ensure that all rows have the same number of '1's.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when the triangle or square is inverted or when the shape is not aligned with the grid edges.

To correctly identify the shapes, the program should:

- Check the entire grid for the pattern of '1's.
- Ensure that the pattern of '1's matches the definition of a triangle or a square.
- Handle both upright and inverted triangles.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
