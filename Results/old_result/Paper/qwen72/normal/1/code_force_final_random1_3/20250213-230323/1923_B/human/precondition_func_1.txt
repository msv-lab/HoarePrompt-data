t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. n and k are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, representing the number of monsters and the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second, respectively. a is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the health of each monster. x is a list of n distinct integers where -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0, representing the initial positions of the monsters relative to your character.
