Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 2 elements.
- `j` is 1.
- `test` is True.
- The difference between the second element and the first element of `lis` is greater than 1.
- `j` is even.

### Analysis:
1. **`lis`**: This is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`. Since `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is derived from these integers and must have at least 2 elements.
2. **Difference Condition**: The difference between the second element and the first element of `lis` is greater than 1. This means that the second element in `lis` is more than 1 unit away from the first element.
3. **`j`**: Initially, `j` is 1, but it is stated that `j` is even. This seems contradictory unless there is some additional logic or update to `j` that makes it even. However, since the initial state explicitly states `j` is even, we will assume this condition holds true.
4. **`test`**: This is a boolean variable set to True.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`.
- The initial state and the conditions provided do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **Alice**
