### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a game where you must kill all monsters before they reach your character.
   - Each monster has a health (`a_i`) and a position (`x_i`).
   - You can fire up to `k` bullets per second, reducing the health of the targeted monsters.
   - Monsters move closer to you by 1 unit each second.
   - You lose if any monster reaches your character (position 0).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**:
     - This function takes the lists `a` (healths), `x` (positions), and `k` (bullets per second) as inputs.
     - It sorts the indices of the monsters based on their absolute positions.
     - It iterates through the sorted indices, firing bullets at the closest monsters first.
     - It checks if any monster reaches the character (position 0) and returns `False` if so.
     - It continues until all monsters are killed or a monster reaches the character.
   - **func_2**:
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n`, the maximum bullets per second `k`, the healths `a`, and the positions `x`.
     - It calls `func_1` for each test case and prints "YES" if the function returns `True` (all monsters are killed), otherwise "NO".

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **func_1**:
     - The function correctly sorts the monsters based on their distance from the character.
     - It fires bullets at the closest monsters first, ensuring that the most immediate threats are addressed.
     - It checks if any monster reaches the character and returns `False` if so.
     - It correctly handles the logic of reducing the health of monsters and moving them closer.
   - **func_2**:
     - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
     - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints the correct result based on the return value of `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
