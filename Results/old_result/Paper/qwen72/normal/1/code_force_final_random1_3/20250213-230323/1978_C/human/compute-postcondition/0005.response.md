The code snippet assigns the result of the function call `func_1(n, k)` to the variable `l`. Since the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `l`. However, we know that `n` and `k` are valid inputs within their specified ranges, and `n` is not equal to 0. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated by `func_4()`, 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= 10^12, `n` is not equal to 0, `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`**.
