Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 3. If `i` (which is 3) is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1, and `bOnes` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `i` (which is 3) is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If neither condition is met, the values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain unchanged unless `i` (which was 2) was in `a` or `b` and met the specified conditions, in which case they would have been incremented accordingly. In the else part, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
