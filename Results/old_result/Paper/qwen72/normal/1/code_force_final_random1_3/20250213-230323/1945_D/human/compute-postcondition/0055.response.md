Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first input integer - 2, `pos_final` is the second input integer - 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is -1, `total` is 0, and `best` is 10^12.** 

Explanation: The code assigns the value `10 ** 12` (which is 1,000,000,000,000) to the variable `best`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
