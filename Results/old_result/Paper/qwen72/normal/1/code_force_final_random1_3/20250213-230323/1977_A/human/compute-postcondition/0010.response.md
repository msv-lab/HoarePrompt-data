Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `n` is not equal to `m`.
- `m` is less than or equal to `n`.
- The current value of `m` is exactly one less than `n`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Yes'`. There are no variables or objects being evaluated or printed in this statement; it is a straightforward print of a constant string.

Output: **Yes**
