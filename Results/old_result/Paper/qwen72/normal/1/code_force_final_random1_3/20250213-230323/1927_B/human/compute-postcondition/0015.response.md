Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `array` is a list of integers derived from the input, `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `ans` is a list of length `l` where each element corresponds to the letter in `alp` based on the count of the respective element in `rev_array` starting from that index, `j` is `l-1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `l = int(input())` updates the value of `l` to the new input integer provided by the user. All other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `l` is now an input integer greater than 0, as specified in the initial state.
