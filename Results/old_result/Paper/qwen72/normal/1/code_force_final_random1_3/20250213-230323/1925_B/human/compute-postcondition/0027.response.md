To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `x` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 1.
   - `n` is the second integer from the input.
   - `q` is 0.
   - `i` is \( \text{int}(\sqrt{x}) + 1 \).
   - `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` such that \( x - n \cdot d \) is non-negative and divisible by `d`, where `d` is a divisor of `x` and \( d \leq \text{int}(\sqrt{x}) \). If no such divisor exists, `ans` remains 1.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `x` and `n` are inputs.
   - `i` is calculated as \( \text{int}(\sqrt{x}) + 1 \), which means it is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `x`.
   - `ans` is determined by finding the largest divisor `d` of `x` that satisfies the conditions \( x - n \cdot d \geq 0 \) and \( (x - n \cdot d) \% d == 0 \).

3. **Finding `ans`:**
   - We need to iterate through all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to \( \text{int}(\sqrt{x}) \).
   - For each divisor `d`, check if \( x - n \cdot d \geq 0 \) and if \( (x - n \cdot d) \% d == 0 \).
   - If such a `d` is found, update `ans` to this `d`.
   - If no such `d` is found, `ans` remains 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` as determined by the above logic.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the conditions, or 1 if no such divisor exists.

Output: **ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x such that x - n * d is non-negative and divisible by d, or 1 if no such divisor exists)**
