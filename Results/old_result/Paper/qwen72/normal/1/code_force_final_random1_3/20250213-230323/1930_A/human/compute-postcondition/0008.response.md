The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `2 * n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 2 (as per the step in the range function), making `i` 4. For the loop to continue executing, `2 * n` must be greater than 4, which means `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 2, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `score` is now equal to the sum of the first and third elements of `l`, `i` is 4**
