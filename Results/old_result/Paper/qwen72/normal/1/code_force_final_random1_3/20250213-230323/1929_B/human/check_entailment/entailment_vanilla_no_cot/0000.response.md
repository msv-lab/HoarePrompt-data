Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum number of cells to color is flawed.

- For the case where \( k = 4n - 2 \), the solution prints \( k // 2 + 1 \). This is incorrect because when \( k = 4n - 2 \), it means all diagonals must have at least one colored cell. In this scenario, the minimum number of cells to color is \( n \), not \( k // 2 + 1 \).

- For other cases, the solution uses `ceil(k / 2)`, which is also incorrect. The correct approach involves understanding the structure of the diagonals and how they overlap. The minimum number of cells to color should be calculated based on the number of diagonals that need to be covered, but the current logic does not account for the optimal placement of colored cells to cover the required diagonals.

A correct solution would involve a more detailed analysis of the grid and the diagonals to ensure that the minimum number of cells is colored to meet the requirement of having at least one colored cell in \( k \) diagonals.
