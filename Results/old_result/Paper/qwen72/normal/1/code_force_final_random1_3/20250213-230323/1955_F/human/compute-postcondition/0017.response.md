Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `cnt` is 0, and if the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, `cnt` will be updated later to `1 +` the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in `a`; otherwise, `cnt` will be updated later to the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in `a`.**
