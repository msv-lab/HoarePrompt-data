Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0. Additionally, the difference between the second and first elements of `l` is less than the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`.**
