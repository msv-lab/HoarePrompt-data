Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 2.
- `l` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `array` is a list of integers derived from the new input.
- `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.
- `ans` is a list of characters where each character corresponds to the count of the respective element in `rev_array` minus 1, mapped to the alphabet.
- `j` is `l`.
- `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
- `alp` is a list containing the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(map(str, ans)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input and Initialization:**
   - `l` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `array` is a list of integers derived from the new input.
   - `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.

2. **Processing `rev_array`:**
   - For each element in `rev_array`, we need to count the occurrences of that element in `rev_array` and then subtract 1.
   - The result of this operation is then mapped to a character in the alphabet using the `alp` list.

3. **Mapping to Alphabet:**
   - The `alp` list contains the lowercase English alphabet letters from 'a' to 'z'.
   - If the count of an element in `rev_array` minus 1 is `n`, then the corresponding character in `ans` will be `alp[n]`.

4. **Constructing `ans`:**
   - `ans` is a list of characters where each character is determined by the above mapping.

5. **Printing the Result:**
   - The `print` statement joins the characters in `ans` into a single string and prints it.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the following input for clarity:
- `l = 5`
- `array = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`

1. **Reversing `array`:**
   - `rev_array = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`

2. **Counting Occurrences and Mapping:**
   - Count of 1 in `rev_array` is 2, so `2 - 1 = 1` -> `alp[1] = 'b'`
   - Count of 2 in `rev_array` is 2, so `2 - 1 = 1` -> `alp[1] = 'b'`
   - Count of 3 in `rev_array` is 1, so `1 - 1 = 0` -> `alp[0] = 'a'`
   - Count of 2 in `rev_array` is 2, so `2 - 1 = 1` -> `alp[1] = 'b'`
   - Count of 1 in `rev_array` is 2, so `2 - 1 = 1` -> `alp[1] = 'b'`

3. **Constructing `ans`:**
   - `ans = ['b', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'b']`

4. **Printing the Result:**
   - `''.join(map(str, ans))` will join the characters in `ans` into a single string: `'bbabb'`

### Final Output:
Output: **bbabb (where the string is constructed based on the counts of elements in the reversed array minus 1, mapped to the alphabet)**
