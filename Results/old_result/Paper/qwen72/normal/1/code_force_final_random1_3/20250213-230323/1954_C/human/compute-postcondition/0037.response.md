Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where \(1 \leq x, y < 10^{100}\), and each digit in `x` and `y` is from 1 to 9.
- `a` and `b` are lists of integers.
- `new` is a list that will have the maximum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`.
- `new2` is a list that will have the minimum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`.
- If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, the list `new` will have the minimum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` from the first index where `a[i] != b[i]` to the end of the list.
- The list `new2` will have the maximum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` from the first index where `a[i] != b[i]` to the end of the list.
- The variable `i` will be equal to the first index where `a[i] != b[i]` or the length of `a` if all elements are equal.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `new` and `new2`**:
   - `new` and `new2` are initially empty lists.
   - For each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`, `new` will contain the maximum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` (which is `a[i]` since they are equal), and `new2` will contain the minimum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` (which is also `a[i]`).

2. **Handling Inequality**:
   - If there is an index `i` where `a[i] != b[i]`, then for all indices from `i` to the end of the list:
     - `new` will contain the minimum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
     - `new2` will contain the maximum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

3. **Final State of `new`**:
   - `new` will contain the maximum values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for indices where `a[i] == b[i]`.
   - For indices where `a[i] != b[i]`, `new` will contain the minimum values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

4. **Print Statement Execution**:
   - The print statement converts each element in `new` to a string and joins them together into a single string.
   - The resulting string is printed.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the logic described, the print statement will output a string that represents the concatenated values of the elements in `new`.

Output: **The concatenated string of the elements in `new` (where `new` contains the maximum values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for indices where `a[i] == b[i]` and the minimum values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for indices where `a[i] != b[i]`)**.
