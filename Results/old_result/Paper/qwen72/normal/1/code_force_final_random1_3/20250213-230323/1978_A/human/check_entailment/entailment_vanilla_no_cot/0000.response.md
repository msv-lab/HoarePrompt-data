Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it always adds the largest number in the list (`nums[-1]`) and the second-largest number (which is supposed to be `max(nums[:-1])`). However, this approach does not correctly handle the division of books into two piles to maximize the sum of the largest numbers in each pile.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Sort the list of book pages.
2. Take the two largest values from the sorted list, as these will be the maximum pages Alice can read from each pile.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort()
        print(nums[-1] + nums[-2])
```

This corrected version ensures that Alice reads the two largest books, which maximizes the total number of pages she can read.
