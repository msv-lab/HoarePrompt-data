The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer representing the size of the chessboard, with the constraint that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5. The function's output is not specified in the given information, so I cannot determine what it returns based on the input.

However, if we assume that the function is designed to return some value related to the chessboard (e.g., the number of squares, the number of possible moves, etc.), the description would need to be based on the actual implementation of the function.

Given the lack of specific output details, here is a general description:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the size of a chessboard, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5. The function's return value is not specified in the provided information.**
