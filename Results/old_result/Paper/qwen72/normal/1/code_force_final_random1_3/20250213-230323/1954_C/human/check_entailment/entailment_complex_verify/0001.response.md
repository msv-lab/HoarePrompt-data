### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Digit Conversion**: The function converts the input strings `a` and `b` into lists of integers. This is necessary to manipulate individual digits.

3. **Initialization**: Two lists `new` and `new2` are initialized to store the resulting digits for `x` and `y` respectively. This is appropriate as we need to construct the final numbers.

4. **Digit Comparison and Swapping**:
   - The function iterates through the digits of `a` and `b`.
   - If the digits at the current position are equal, they are directly assigned to `new` and `new2` without swapping.
   - If the digits are not equal, the maximum digit is assigned to `new` and the minimum digit is assigned to `new2`.

5. **Handling Remaining Digits**:
   - The function assigns the minimum of the remaining digits to `new` and the maximum to `new2` after the first non-equal pair. This approach is intended to maximize the product, but it is not optimal.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the resulting numbers by joining the lists `new` and `new2` into strings.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Digits**: The logic for handling remaining digits after the first non-equal pair is flawed. The goal is to maximize the product, which means we should always try to place the largest possible digits in the most significant positions. The current implementation does not achieve this.

### Correct Approach:
- To maximize the product, we should sort the digits of both numbers in descending order and then reassign them to form the largest possible numbers.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, list(input())))
        b = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        # Combine all digits and sort them in descending order
        combined = sorted(a + b, reverse=True)
        
        # Assign the largest digits to the first number and the next largest to the second number
        new = []
        new2 = []
        for i in range(len(combined)):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                new.append(combined[i])
            else:
                new2.append(combined[i])
        
        # Ensure the lengths match the original numbers
        if len(new) > len(a):
            new.pop()
        if len(new2) > len(b):
            new2.pop()
        
        print(''.join(map(str, new)))
        print(''.join(map(str, new2)))
```

### Final Correctness:
- The original program does not correctly maximize the product of the two numbers. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

Final: **False**
