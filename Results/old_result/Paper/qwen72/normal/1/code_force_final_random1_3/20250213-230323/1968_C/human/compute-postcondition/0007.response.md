Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to 1000 and the second element set to 1000 + x[0], `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[i]` (which is `a[1]` since `i` is 1) is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.
- `a[i - 1]` is `a[0]`, which is 1000.
- `x[i - 1]` is `x[0]`, the first element of the list `x`.
- Therefore, `a[1]` is set to 1000 + `x[0]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
