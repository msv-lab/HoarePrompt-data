Output State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged, `nx` is the concatenation of characters from `xx[i]` where each character is either the corresponding character from `xx[i]` if it is not '?', or 'S' if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, or 'F' otherwise.**

### Explanation:
- **`j`**: After the loop completes, `j` will be `n + 1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n` inclusive.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb`**: These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`nx`**: The variable `nx` is built up during each iteration of the loop. For each `j` from `1` to `n`:
  - If the character at `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', that character is appended to `nx`.
  - If the character at `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', and `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb` (i.e., `sb[:n // 4]`), 'S' is appended to `nx`.
  - Otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.

Thus, after all iterations, `nx` will contain the concatenated result based on the rules described above.
