Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: d is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, processing is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), da is an integer key present in d, rank is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), tmp is 1000000000, and the length of the list d[da] is greater than 1
Code of the loop:
for di in d[da]:
    if processing[di - 1] == 0:
        processing[di - 1] = 1
        tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
        processing[di - 1] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `da` is an integer key present in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `tmp` is 1000000000, the length of the list `d[da]` is greater than 1, `di` is the first element of `d[da]`. If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, `processing[di - 1]` is set to 0, and `tmp` is updated to the minimum of the original `tmp` (1000000000) and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `da` is an integer key present in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `tmp` is 1000000000, `di` is the second element of `d[da]`. If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, `tmp` is updated to the minimum value between the original `tmp` (1000000000) and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `da` is an integer key present in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `tmp` is 1000000000 or the minimum value between the original `tmp` (1000000000) and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`, `di` is the third element of `d[da]`. If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, then `processing[di - 1]` is updated to 1, and `tmp` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. Otherwise, all variables remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
