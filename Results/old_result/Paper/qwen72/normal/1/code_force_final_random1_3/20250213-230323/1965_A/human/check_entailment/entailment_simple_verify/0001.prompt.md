You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Output

    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

    #The program returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True`, otherwise it returns 'Bob'. Here, `A` is `True` if the loop breaks before completing, indicating a condition was met that changed `A` to `True`. If the loop completes without breaking, `A` remains `False`. Additionally, if `not_c` is `True`, meaning no two consecutive elements in `set_` have a difference greater than 1, then `A` is `False` unless the loop breaks.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one. This is done correctly using a while loop that runs `t` times.

2. **Reading Input for Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of pile sizes `arr`. This is also handled correctly.

3. **Function Call**: The program calls a function `func_1` with the list of pile sizes `arr` and prints the result. This is the correct approach to modularize the logic.

4. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` starts by initializing a boolean variable `A` to `False`.
   - It checks if the first element of the array `arr` is not 1. If it is not 1, it immediately returns 'Alice'. This is incorrect because the first element being 1 does not necessarily mean Bob wins. The game logic is more complex than this.
   - It then creates a set of unique elements from `arr`, sorts it, and iterates through the sorted set to check if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1. If it finds such a difference, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - It toggles the value of `A` for each element in the sorted set.
   - If `not_c` is still `True` after the loop, it toggles `A` one more time.
   - Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True`, otherwise 'Bob'.

5. **Logical Errors**:
   - The condition `if arr[0] != 1:` is incorrect. The game logic should consider the entire array, not just the first element.
   - The logic for determining the winner based on the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted set is flawed. The game is about removing the same number of stones from all non-empty piles, and the winner is determined by the parity of the number of moves.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach to determine the winner is to use the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program has logical errors in determining the winner of the game. The correct approach involves calculating the Nim-sum of the pile sizes to determine the winner.
