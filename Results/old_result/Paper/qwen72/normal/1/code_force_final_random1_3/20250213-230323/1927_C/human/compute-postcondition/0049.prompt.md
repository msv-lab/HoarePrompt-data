Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
    elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1. If `i` (which is now 2) is present in both lists `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is set to 1 and `bOnes` is set to 0. Otherwise, `aOnes` is set to 0 and `bOnes` is set to 1. If `i` is not in `a` or not in `b`, and `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If neither of these conditions is met, `bOnes` remains 0, and the program may break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2. The values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain unchanged unless `i` (which was 2) was in `a` or `b` and met the specified conditions, in which case they would have been incremented accordingly.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 4, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain unchanged unless `i` (which is 3) was in `a` or `b` and met the specified conditions, in which case they would have been incremented accordingly.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
