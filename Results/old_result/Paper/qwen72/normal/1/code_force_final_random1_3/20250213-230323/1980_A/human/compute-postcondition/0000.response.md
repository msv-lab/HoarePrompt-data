The provided code snippet is a docstring that describes a function's purpose, parameters, and return type. It does not contain any executable code that would change the state of the variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is a tuple `(n, m)` with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 and `m` being a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and the second element is a string `a` consisting of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'.

Since the code snippet only provides documentation and does not execute any operations, the state of the variables remains the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is a tuple `(n, m)` with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 and `m` being a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and the second element is a string `a` consisting of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'.**
