Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly sets up the test cases and iterates over them. The use of `t` and `test_cases` is appropriate for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: The program initializes a frequency array `freq` of size 7 to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). The mapping `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is used to convert the character to its corresponding index in the `freq` array, which is correct.

3. **Missing Problems Calculation**: The program calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level by using the expression `max(0, m - f)`. This ensures that if there are already enough problems of a certain difficulty, no additional problems are needed. The `sum` function then adds up these values to get the total number of missing problems. This logic is sound and correctly implements the requirement.

4. **Output**: The program appends the result for each test case to the `results` list and prints each result at the end. This matches the expected output format.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when there are no problems of a certain difficulty level or when there are already enough problems for all rounds. The use of `max(0, m - f)` ensures that negative values are not added to the total, which is correct.

6. **Test Case Verification**: The provided test cases are correctly handled by the program, and the output matches the expected results.

Given the above steps, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Final: **True**
