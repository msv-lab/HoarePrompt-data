Postcondition: ***`feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` must be less than `test_cases`, `i` is 1. If the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.***
