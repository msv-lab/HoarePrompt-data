To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `v`.
   - The range function parameters are `na_frente`, `-1`, and `-1`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0. This is because the loop iterates from `na_frente` down to 0 (inclusive).

3. **Adjust States:**
   - `v` should start at `na_frente` and decrement by 1 until it reaches -1.
   - `na_frente` must be at least 0 for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 2.
- `c` is 2.
- `na_frente` is the first input integer minus 1 and must be at least 0.
- `pos_final` is the second input integer minus 1.
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input.
- `v` is `na_frente`.
- `total` is 0.
- `best` is 10^12.

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first input integer minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is 0, and `best` is 10^12**
