Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code).
- `a` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.

The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **NO**
