The code snippet assigns the values from the input to the variables `A`, `B`, and `C` using the `map` function to convert them to integers. The input is split into three parts, and each part is converted to an integer and assigned to `A`, `B`, and `C` respectively. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers from the input, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
