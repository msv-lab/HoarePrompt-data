To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
- `j` is `n`.
- `i` is `1`.
- `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.
- If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `B[r]`, and `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`.
- Otherwise, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `i = 1`
   - `j = n`
   - `a` and `b` are initially undefined but will be set based on the conditions provided.

2. **Update `b`**:
   - `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.
   - Since `i = 1`, this becomes `b + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then:
     - `r` is decreased by 1.
     - `a` is set to `B[r]`.
     - `b` is set to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`.
   - Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - The expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is evaluated.
   - Since `i = 1`, `n - i` simplifies to `n - 1`.

### Output Determination:
- The exact values of `a` and `b` depend on the specific values of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B`, which are derived from the string `s`.
- Without the exact string `s`, we cannot compute the precise numerical values of `a` and `b`.
- However, the formula `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - 1)` will be printed.

### Final Output:
Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - 1) (where a and b are determined based on the conditions described in the initial state)**
