The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from user input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This operation does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Here's the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 where `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is an input integer greater than 1, `j` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers provided by user input.**
