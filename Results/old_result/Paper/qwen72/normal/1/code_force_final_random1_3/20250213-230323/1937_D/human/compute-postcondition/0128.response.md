Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
- `j` is `n`.
- `i` is `1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(n - i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `i` is `1`.

The expression `n - i` calculates the difference between the length of the string `s` and the value of `i`. Given that `i` is `1`, the expression simplifies to `n - 1`.

### Output:
The print statement will print the value of `n - 1`, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **n - 1 (where n is the length of the string s)**
