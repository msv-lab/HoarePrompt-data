You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and m is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000.

            tmp = ''
            for i in range(k):

    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `i` is `t-1` (which would be -1 since `t` is 0), `n`, `k`, and `m` are the final input integers for the last test case, `s` is the final input string for the last test case, `cnt` is the total number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the last test case, `ans` is the final string constructed during the last test case, and `cur` is the final bitmask value after processing all characters in the last test case. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO" followed by the string `ans` concatenated with `tmp` (if `tmp` is not an empty string) and `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by parameters `n`, `k`, `m`, and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` can be partitioned into `n` substrings such that each substring contains all `k` distinct characters. If it can, the function prints "YES". If it cannot, the function prints "NO" followed by a modified version of the string `s` that includes additional characters to meet the requirement. The function reads inputs from standard input and prints results to standard output. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. Instead, it seems to track the presence of individual characters and their combinations in a way that does not ensure all possible combinations of length `n` are checked.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
2 2 3
aab
```
Expected Output:
```
NO
bb
```
Actual Output:
```
YES
```
In this case, the string "bb" is not a subsequence of "aab", but the program incorrectly outputs "YES".

The issue lies in how the program tracks the presence of subsequences. It uses a bitmask to track the presence of characters, but it does not correctly account for all possible combinations of length `n`. Specifically, the program only increments the count when the current combination of characters matches the first `k` characters, which is insufficient to ensure all possible strings of length `n` are checked.
