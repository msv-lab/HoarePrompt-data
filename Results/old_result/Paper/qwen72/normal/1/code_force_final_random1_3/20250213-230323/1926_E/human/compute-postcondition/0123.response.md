Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), the function calculates and prints a specific value based on a series of operations involving variables `s`, `d`, `i`, `h`, `p`, `g`, and `f`. Otherwise, it simply prints \(2 \times k - 1\). After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value, and the state of the program is reset for each test case. **
