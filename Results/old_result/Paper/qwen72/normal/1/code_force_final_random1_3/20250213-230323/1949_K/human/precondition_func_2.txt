num is an integer representing a number from the input list x_1, x_2, ..., x_n. The variables sum_a, sum_b, sum_c are the current sums of the numbers in groups A, B, and C, respectively. The variables group_a, group_b, and group_c are lists containing the numbers in groups A, B, and C, respectively. The variables na, nb, and nc are the desired sizes of groups A, B, and C, respectively, such that 1 <= na, nb, nc <= n-2 and na + nb + nc = n.
