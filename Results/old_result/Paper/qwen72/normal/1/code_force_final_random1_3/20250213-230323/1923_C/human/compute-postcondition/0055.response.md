Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `p` is `[0]`, `c` is `[0]`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0.**

Explanation: The variables `i` and `j` are both set to 0. All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
