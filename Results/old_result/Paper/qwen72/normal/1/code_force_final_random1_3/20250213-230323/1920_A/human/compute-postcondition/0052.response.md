Output State: **`num` is still a list containing at least one element. `i` will be the next element in `num` (the third element if the list has at least three elements). If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `count_num` is incremented by 1. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
