Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `x` is 1, `y` is 3. If the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is the minimum of `n / 3` and `m // 6` plus the minimum of `n / 4` and `m // 12`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains the minimum of `n / 3` and `m // 6`.***
