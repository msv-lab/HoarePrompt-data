Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first input integer minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `best` is assigned the value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.
- `v` is defined as `na_frente - 1`.
- Therefore, `best` is calculated as `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
