#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is a tuple (n, m) with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 and m being a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and the second element is a string a consisting of n characters from 'A' to 'G'.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing `t` values of `missing`, each `missing` value corresponding to the result of processing one tuple from `test_cases`. For each tuple `(n, m, a)` in `test_cases`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and `a` is a string consisting of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'. The `freq` list is used internally to count the frequency of each character from 'A' to 'G' in `a`, and `missing` is the sum of the differences between `m` and each frequency in `freq` where the frequency is less than `m`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing `t` values of `missing`, where each `missing` value corresponds to the result of processing one tuple from `test_cases`. Each `missing` value represents the sum of the differences between `m` and the frequency of each character from 'A' to 'G' in the string `a`, where the frequency is less than `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases` as inputs. Each tuple in `test_cases` consists of a tuple `(n, m)` and a string `a`, where `n` is the number of problems, `m` is the number of rounds, and `a` is a string of problem difficulties. The function calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case to ensure that each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') appears at least `m` times. It returns a list `results` containing `t` integers, each representing the number of additional problems required for the corresponding test case.
