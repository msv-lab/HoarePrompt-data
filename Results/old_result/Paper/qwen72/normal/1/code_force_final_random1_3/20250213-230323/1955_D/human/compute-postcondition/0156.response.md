Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `m` is a positive integer, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is incremented by 1, and `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and `curr` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
