### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a game where you and a computer take turns placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard.
   - The goal is to count the number of different final configurations after all valid moves are made, given the initial \( k \) moves.
   - The computer mirrors your moves, except when the move is on the diagonal (i.e., \( r = c \)).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The function `func_1` precomputes the number of ways to place rooks on a board of size \( i \) using dynamic programming.
   - The base cases are:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: Only one way to place a rook on a \( 1 \times 1 \) board.
     - `dp[2] = 3`: Three ways to place rooks on a \( 2 \times 2 \) board.
   - For larger boards, the recurrence relation is:
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`
     - This accounts for placing a rook in a new row and column, and the two possible ways to place the mirrored rook.

3. **Handling Invalid Positions**:
   - The set `invalid` keeps track of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.
   - For each move, the positions \( r \) and \( c \) are added to the `invalid` set.
   - The number of valid positions left is \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \).

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - The result for each test case is the value of `dp[n - len(invalid)]`.
   - If there are no invalid positions, the result is at least 1 (since there's always at least one way to place rooks).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( n \) is small (e.g., \( n = 1 \)).
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It correctly handles the placement of rooks and the mirroring behavior of the computer. The use of the `invalid` set ensures that the positions already occupied are accounted for, and the final result is computed correctly.

Correctness: **True**
