Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of `s` is at least 1. If `char` is in `unique_chars`, all occurrences of `char` in `s` have been replaced with `unique_chars[j+1]`, `char` is the next character in the updated string `s`, and `j` is now `j - 1`. Otherwise, `char` is the next character in the string `s`, `unique_chars` now contains `char` inserted at index `i-1`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is incremented by 1.***
