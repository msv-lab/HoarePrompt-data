Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is `n + 1`, `nx` is an empty string (`''`).**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `nx = ''` sets the variable `nx` to an empty string.
- The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The initial conditions for `i`, `n`, and `j` are still valid.
- The description of `nx` as a string of length `n` with specific character rules is no longer applicable because `nx` is now explicitly set to an empty string.
