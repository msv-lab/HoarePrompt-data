Output State: **`x` must be at least 0, `c` is `i // 2`, `val` is sorted with even numbers first followed by odd numbers, both in ascending order, and must have at least one element, `sx` is the count of how many times `c` was equal to 1 during the loop plus `i`. If `y` is less than `c`, `sx` is incremented by `y * 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `cons`, `y`, `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.**
