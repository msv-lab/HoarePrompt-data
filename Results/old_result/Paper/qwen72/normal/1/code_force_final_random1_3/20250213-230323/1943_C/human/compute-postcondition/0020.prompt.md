Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of empty lists, where the length of `u2vs` is equal to `n`. Each sublist in `u2vs` is initially empty.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n - 1):
    u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    u -= 1
    v -= 1
    u2vs[u].append(v)
    u2vs[v].append(u)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to `n`, the list at index `u` now contains the value `v` (which is the second integer provided as input minus 1), the list at index `v` in `u2vs` now includes the value `u` appended to it, `u` is decreased by 1, `v` is the second integer provided as input minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to `n`, the list at index `u` contains the value `v` twice, the list at index `v` in `u2vs` now includes the value `u` three times, `u` is the first integer provided as input minus 2, `v` is the second integer provided as input minus 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to `n`, the list at index `u-1` contains the value `v` three times, the list at index `v-1` in `u2vs` now includes the value `u-1` three times and the value `u` one additional time, `u` is the integer provided as input minus 1, `v` is the integer provided as input minus 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
