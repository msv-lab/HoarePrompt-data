Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `k`, where `n` represents the size of a square grid and `k` represents the minimum number of diagonals that should contain at least one colored cell. The function calculates and prints a specific value for each test case based on the following conditions: if `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, it prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`; if `k` is exactly `4 * n - 3`, it prints `2 * n - 1`; if `k` is `4 * n - 2`, it prints `2 * n`. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution, and the appropriate output has been printed for each test case. **
