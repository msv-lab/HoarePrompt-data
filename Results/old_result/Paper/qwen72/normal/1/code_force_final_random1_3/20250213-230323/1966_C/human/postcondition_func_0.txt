The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. It then determines and prints whether "Alice" or "Bob" wins based on the condition that any difference between consecutive unique, sorted (in descending order) pile sizes (excluding the last 0) is greater than 1. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `tc` set to 0, `n` being the length of the processed list minus 1, `arr` being the unique, sorted list of integers followed by 0, and `dp` being `True` if the winning condition is met, otherwise `False`.
