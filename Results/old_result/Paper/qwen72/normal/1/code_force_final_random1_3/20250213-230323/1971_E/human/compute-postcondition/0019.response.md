Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `ad` is a list containing `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`, `bd` is a list containing `[0, b[len(a) - 1] - b[len(a) - 2], b[len(a)] - b[len(a) - 1], b[i] - b[i - 1]]`, `i` is `len(a) + 2`, `len(a) < len(b)`**

Explanation:
- The code appends the difference `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`.
- The value of `i` is `len(a) + 2`, which means `i` is the index beyond the last element of `a` plus 2.
- The list `bd` now includes the new element `b[i] - b[i - 1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
