Output State: **`rest` is `k`, `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`, `distance` is `distance + 1`, all other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) retain their initial values. If `abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`, the program returns False.**

Explanation:
- The variable `rest` is updated to the value of `k`.
- The condition `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices` remains unchanged.
- The variable `distance` is incremented by 1, so it is now `distance + 1`.
- All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) retain their initial values.
- The condition for returning `False` remains the same: if `abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`, the program returns `False`.
