Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer input by the user, `b` is the second integer input by the user, `m` is the third integer input by the user, and `mn` is the value of `min(a, b) + m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, the program maintains these values. Otherwise, the program also maintains these values.***
