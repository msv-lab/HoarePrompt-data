Output State: **`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `power` is 1. If `n` is 1, the value of `n` remains 1. If `n` is greater than or equal to `power - 1`, then if `power` equals `n`, `power` remains `n + 1`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `n`, and `power` is not equal to `n + 1`.**
