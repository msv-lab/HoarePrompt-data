### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Checks (`func_4`)**:
   - The function reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It checks if `k` is even. If not, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating no valid permutation exists.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) based on the parity of `n`.
     - For odd `n`, `max_k = (n^2 - 1) // 2`.
     - For even `n`, `max_k = n^2 // 2`.
   - If `k` exceeds `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating no valid permutation exists.
   - Otherwise, it returns the valid `n` and `k`.

2. **Permutation Generation (`func_1`)**:
   - The function initializes a list `l` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It iterates from `n` down to 1 in steps of 2, decrementing `k` by the current value of `i - 1` and swapping elements in the list using `func_3`.
   - If `k` becomes 0 during the loop, it returns the current permutation.
   - If `k` becomes less than `i - 1`, it calls `func_2` to make the final adjustments to the permutation.
   - The loop ensures that the permutation is adjusted to achieve the desired Manhattan value.

3. **Final Permutation Output (`func_5`)**:
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the elements of the permutation list `l`.

4. **Main Function (`func_6`)**:
   - It calls `func_4` to get valid `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - Otherwise, it generates the permutation using `func_1` and prints it using `func_5`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Input Validation**: The program correctly validates the input and ensures that `k` is even and within the possible range.
- **Permutation Generation**: The logic for generating the permutation and adjusting it to achieve the desired Manhattan value is sound. The use of `func_3` and `func_2` ensures that the permutation is modified correctly.
- **Output**: The program correctly outputs "NO" if no valid permutation exists and "YES" followed by the permutation if one does exist.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles all specified cases as per the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
