Postcondition: **After the loop has executed all its iterations, `a` remains a list of `n` integers where `n` is at least 2, and all integers are distinct and within the range [1, 10^9]. `x` is still the integer at index `k` in the list `a`. `ind` is an empty list, indicating that there are no elements in `a` that are greater than `x`. `c` is 0, as there are no elements in `a` that are greater than `x`. If `k` is 14, this condition is explicitly noted.**
