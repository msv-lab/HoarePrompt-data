### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of elements in an array that can be made equal by adding a permutation to the array. The key steps in the solution are:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, the program:
   - Reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - Sorts the unique elements of the array.
   - Uses binary search to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation.

Let's break down the code and the functions:

- **func_1()**: This function reads an integer from the input, which is used to determine the number of test cases and the length of the array. It works correctly for reading integers.
- **func_3()**: This function reads a line of space-separated integers and returns them as a list. It is used to read the array elements and works correctly.
- **Main Logic**:
  - The main logic involves sorting the unique elements of the array and using binary search to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal.
  - The loop iterates over the sorted unique elements and uses `bisect_left` to find the position of the element after adding the permutation.
  - The difference between the positions gives the count of elements that can be made equal.

### Analysis of the Main Logic:
- **Sorting Unique Elements**: The array is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then sorted. This ensures that we are working with unique elements in ascending order.
- **Binary Search**: The `bisect_left` function is used to find the position of the element after adding the permutation. The difference between the positions gives the count of elements that can be made equal.
- **Max Count Calculation**: The maximum count is updated in each iteration to ensure we get the maximum possible number of equal elements.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases**: The code should handle edge cases such as arrays with all elements being the same or very large arrays.
- **Performance**: The code should be efficient enough to handle the constraints (up to 2 * 10^5 elements).

### Conclusion:
The provided code and functions seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The use of sorting, unique elements, and binary search is appropriate for the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
