The function reads an integer `n` and then reads `n` lines of input, each containing three integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and radius of a disk. It initializes a list `visited` to track which disks have been processed and a list `coef` for additional calculations. The function then processes the disks to determine if the graph formed by the disks is bipartite and if there is at least one disk processed. If the graph is bipartite and at least one disk is processed, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The final state of the program includes the modified `visited` and `coef` lists, and the variables `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok` reflecting the results of the processing.
