Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `k` is the last `i` for which `res` was `<` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `best` is 0.
- `res` is the input string from the last iteration.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`k`**: According to the initial state, `k` is the last `i` for which `res` was `<` or 1 if no such `i` exists. Since `i` is currently 1 and there is no information about any previous iterations where `res` was `<`, `k` will be 1.
2. **`best`**: The initial state specifies that `best` is 0.
3. **`i`**: The initial state specifies that `i` is 1.

### Output:
The print statement will output the following values:
- `'?'` (a literal string)
- `k` (which is 1)
- `best` (which is 0)
- `k` (which is 1 again)
- `i` (which is 1)

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 1 0 1 1**
