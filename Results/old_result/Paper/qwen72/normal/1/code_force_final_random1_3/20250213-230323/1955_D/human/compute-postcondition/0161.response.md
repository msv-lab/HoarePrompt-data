To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - m - 1`, where `n` is greater than `m` and `m` is a positive integer.
   - `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`. This means `cnt_b` is a dictionary or array that keeps track of the counts of elements in the list `b` up to the first `m` elements.
   - `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`.
   - `cnt_b[a[k]]` is adjusted based on the presence of `a[k]` in `b_values` for each `k` in the range from `m` to `n-1`. This means the counts in `cnt_b` are updated as the sliding window moves through the list `a`.
   - `curr` reflects the number of elements in the current sliding window of size `m` that are in `b_values` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b`.
   - `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `ans` is the final result that we need to print. It represents the number of times the current sliding window of size `m` in list `a` contained at least `k` elements that are also in `b_values` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b`.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `m`, `n`, and `k` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`.
   - However, based on the given conditions, `ans` is the count of valid sliding windows where the number of elements in `b_values` with non-negative counts is at least `k`.

Given this understanding, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will be the value of `ans` as described above.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total number of times the current sliding window of size m in list a contained at least k elements that are also in b_values and have a non-negative count in cnt_b)**
