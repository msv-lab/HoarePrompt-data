The code snippet `ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])` appends the difference between the second element (`a[1]`) and the first element (`a[0]`) of the list `a` to the list `ad`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)
- `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `q` is an input integer
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements
- `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input
- `ad` is a list containing only the integer 0
- `bd` is a list containing only the integer 0
- `i` is 1

After executing the code:
- `ad` will now contain two elements: the original 0 and the new value `a[1] - a[0]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input, `ad` is a list containing [0, `a[1] - a[0]`], `bd` is a list containing only the integer 0, `i` is 1**.
