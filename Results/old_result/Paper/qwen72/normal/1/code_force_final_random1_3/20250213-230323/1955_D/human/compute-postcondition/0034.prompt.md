Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `_` is a placeholder for iterating over a range determined by a positive integer input, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 (values are taken from input), `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 initialized with all elements set to 0 except for the elements at indices corresponding to the values in `b[:m]`, each of which is incremented by 1, `i` is `m-1`, `m` is the same as the input value for `m`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
            curr += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `_` is a placeholder for iterating over a range determined by a positive integer input, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 (values are taken from input), `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 initialized with all elements set to 0 except for the elements at indices corresponding to the values in `b[:m]`, each of which is incremented by 1, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt_b` remains unchanged and `curr` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `_` is a placeholder for iterating over a range determined by a positive integer input, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 (values are taken from input), `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 initialized with all elements set to 0 except for the elements at indices corresponding to the values in `b[:m]`, each of which is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0. If `a[1]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[1]]` is decremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[1]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt_b` remains unchanged and `curr` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `_` is a placeholder for iterating over a range determined by a positive integer input, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 (values are taken from input), `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 initialized with all elements set to 0 except for the elements at indices corresponding to the values in `b[:m]`, each of which is incremented by 1, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0. If `a[2]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[2]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt_b` remains unchanged and `curr` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
