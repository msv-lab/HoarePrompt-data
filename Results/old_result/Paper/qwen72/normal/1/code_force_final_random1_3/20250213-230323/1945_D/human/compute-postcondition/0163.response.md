The code appends the integer value of the third string in `b` (which is stored in `y`) to the list `b_values`. The initial state specifies that `b_values` already contains the integer values of the first and second strings in `b`. After executing the code, `b_values` will now include three elements: the integer values of the first, second, and third strings in `b`.

Output State: **`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces and must have at least 3 strings, `y` is the third string in `b`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer value of the first string in `b`, the integer value of the second string in `b`, and the integer value of the third string in `b`.**
