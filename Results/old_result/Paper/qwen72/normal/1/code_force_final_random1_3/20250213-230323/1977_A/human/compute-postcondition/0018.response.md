Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, and `n` is not equal to `m`.
- `m` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `m` is not equal to `n - 1`.
- Either `m` is not even, or `n` is not even, or both.
- However, either `m` is even, or `n` is even, or both.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **No**
