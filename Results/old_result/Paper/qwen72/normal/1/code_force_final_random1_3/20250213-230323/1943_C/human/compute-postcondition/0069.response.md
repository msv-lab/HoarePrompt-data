To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ops))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the construction of the `ops` list based on the conditions provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`path_ba`**: This is a list containing the value of `b` followed by the sequence of node indices leading back to node 0, including the final value of `n`.
2. **`ops`**: The list of tuples derived from `path_ba` based on the length of `path_ba`.

### Construction of `ops`:
- **If the length of `path_ba` is odd**:
  - `ops` contains tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., up to `(c, ci)`, where `c` is the element at the middle index of `path_ba` and `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`.
- **If the length of `path_ba` is even**:
  - `ops` contains tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, `(c2, 5)`, ..., `(c1, len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`, `(c2, len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.

### Determining the Length of `ops`:
- **Odd Length of `path_ba`**:
  - The middle index `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`.
  - The number of tuples in `ops` is `ci + 1` (since it includes indices from 0 to `ci`).
- **Even Length of `path_ba`**:
  - `c2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`.
  - `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
  - The number of tuples in `ops` is `2 * (c2 - 1) + 2` (since it pairs `c1` and `c2` for each odd index up to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`).

### Example Calculation:
- **Odd Length Example**:
  - Suppose `path_ba = [b, 3, 2, 1, 0]` (length 5).
  - Middle index `ci` is `2`.
  - `ops` will be `[(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]`.
  - Length of `ops` is `3`.

- **Even Length Example**:
  - Suppose `path_ba = [b, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]` (length 6).
  - `c2` is `3`.
  - `c1` is `2`.
  - `ops` will be `[(2, 1), (3, 1), (2, 3), (3, 3), (2, 5), (3, 5)]`.
  - Length of `ops` is `6`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the construction rules, the length of `ops` depends on the length of `path_ba`. Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not provided, we can only describe the length of `ops` in terms of the length of `path_ba`.

- If `path_ba` has an odd length, the length of `ops` is `(len(path_ba) // 2) + 1`.
- If `path_ba` has an even length, the length of `ops` is `len(path_ba)`.

Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is (len(path_ba) // 2) + 1 if path_ba has an odd length, or len(path_ba) if path_ba has an even length)**
