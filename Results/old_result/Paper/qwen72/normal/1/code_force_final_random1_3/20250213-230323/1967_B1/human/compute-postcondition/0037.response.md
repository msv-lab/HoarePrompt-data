Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the new input integers, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / m) - (m - 1)`**

Explanation: The value of `countmins` is updated to `int(count - 1)`. Since `count` is 2, `countmins` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
