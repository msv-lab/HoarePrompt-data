The function `bfs` accepts two parameters: `start` and `target`. Both `start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in a tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. The tree is represented as a dictionary or adjacency list where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring node indices.

- **Case_1**: The function returns 0.
- **Case_2**: The function returns the distance (`dist`) which is the second element from the tuple that was popped from the queue. This distance represents the number of steps taken from the `start` node to reach the current node (`current`).
- **Case_3**: The function returns the distance (`dist`) which represents the shortest path from `start` to `target` if the `target` node was reached. If the `target` node was not found, the function returns the distance to the last node processed from the queue.
- **Case_4**: The function returns -1, indicating that the target node was not found in the traversal from the start node.

Functionality: **The function `bfs` accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, both integers representing nodes in a tree. It performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is found, it returns the distance (number of steps) from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is not found, it returns -1. In some cases, it may return 0 or the distance to the last node processed, depending on the traversal outcome.**
