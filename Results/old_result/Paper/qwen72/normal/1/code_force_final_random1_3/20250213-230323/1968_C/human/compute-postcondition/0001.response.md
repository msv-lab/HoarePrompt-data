The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer greater than 0. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0**
