To determine what will be printed by the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `l` is a list of integers from the latest user input.
- `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0, and `d1[2]` is explicitly set to 1.
- `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is explicitly set to 1.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the latest user input.

### Analysis:
- `d1` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0. This means that any key that is not explicitly set will return 0.
- The only explicitly set key in `d1` is `2`, and its value is 1.
- The values of `x` and `y` are provided by the latest user input, but their specific values are not given.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

### Possible Outcomes:
1. If `y == 2` and `x != 2`:
   - `d1[y]` will be 1 (since `d1[2]` is 1).
   - `d1[x]` will be 0 (since `x` is not 2 and the default value is 0).
   - The result will be `1 - 0 = 1`.

2. If `y != 2` and `x == 2`:
   - `d1[y]` will be 0 (since `y` is not 2 and the default value is 0).
   - `d1[x]` will be 1 (since `d1[2]` is 1).
   - The result will be `0 - 1 = -1`.

3. If both `y` and `x` are not 2:
   - Both `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` will be 0 (since the default value is 0).
   - The result will be `0 - 0 = 0`.

4. If both `y` and `x` are 2:
   - Both `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` will be 1.
   - The result will be `1 - 1 = 0`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement depends on the values of `x` and `y` provided by the user. However, based on the given information, the possible outputs are:

- **1** if `y == 2` and `x != 2`.
- **-1** if `y != 2` and `x == 2`.
- **0** if both `y` and `x` are either 2 or not 2.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can only describe the possible outcomes.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[2] is 1 and the default value for any other key is 0)**
