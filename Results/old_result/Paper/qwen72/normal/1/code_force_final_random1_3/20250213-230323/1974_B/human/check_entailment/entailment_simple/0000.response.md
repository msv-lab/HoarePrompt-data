Reasoning:

The provided program aims to decode an encoded string according to the specified algorithm. However, there are several issues with the implementation of `func_1` that prevent it from correctly performing the decoding:

1. **Incorrect Use of `replace` Method**: The `replace` method is used inside the loop to replace characters in the string `s`. This approach is problematic because `replace` replaces all occurrences of the character in the entire string, not just the current one being processed. This can lead to incorrect replacements and overwrite characters that should not be changed yet.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Handling Unique Characters**: The logic for handling characters that are not in `unique_chars` by inserting them into `unique_chars` and adjusting `i` and `j` is unnecessary and incorrect. The algorithm should only focus on replacing characters that are in `unique_chars`.

3. **Incorrect Final Return Value**: The function returns `''.join(unique_chars)`, which is a string of the unique characters in the order they appear in `s`. This is not the decoded string but rather a list of unique characters. The correct approach would be to construct the decoded string by mapping each character in `s` to its corresponding character in `unique_chars` based on the symmetric positions.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
