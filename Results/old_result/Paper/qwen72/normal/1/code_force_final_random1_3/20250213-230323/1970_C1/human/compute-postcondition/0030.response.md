Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is the last element of the final non-empty list before it was popped, `one` alternates between `True` and `False` depending on the number of iterations (if the total number of iterations is odd, `one` is `False`; if even, `one` is `True`), `two` is `True`, and all lists in `lst` that were initially non-empty are now empty.**
