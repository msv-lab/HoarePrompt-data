The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently executing within. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The conditions `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<') or (a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` are still valid, and `n` is still greater than 1, and `i` is still 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and either (i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<') or (a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
