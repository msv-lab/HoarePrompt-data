Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `one_perc` is 0, `s[i]` is not '0', `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 50, `one` is 1 or 2, `lst` is [1, 2].**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is 1.
- `n` remains an input integer greater than 1.
- `one_perc` remains 0.
- The condition `s[i]` is not '0' holds true, so `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 50, and `one` is 1 or 2.
- The list `lst` initially contains [1], and after appending `i + 1` (which is 2), `lst` becomes [1, 2].
