Output State: **`a` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by spaces, `y` is the last string in `a`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all strings in `a`, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `b_values` is an empty list, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `custo` is 0, `custos` now includes the value of `custo`, `i` is `i_last + 1`, `x` must be greater than `i_last + 1`, `nf` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by spaces.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `a` remains a list of strings obtained from the input split by spaces.
- The variable `y` is the last string in the list `a`.
- The variable `a_values` is now a list containing the integer values of all the strings in `a`.
- The variable `b` remains a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces.
- The variable `b_values` remains an empty list.
- The variable `num_fila` remains the integer value of the first element in `nf`.
- The variable `max_p` remains the integer value of the second element in `nf`.
- The variable `custo` remains 0.
- The variable `custos` now includes the value of `custo`.
- The variable `i` remains `i_last + 1`.
- The variable `x` must still be greater than `i_last + 1`.
- The variable `nf` remains a list of strings obtained from the input split by spaces.
