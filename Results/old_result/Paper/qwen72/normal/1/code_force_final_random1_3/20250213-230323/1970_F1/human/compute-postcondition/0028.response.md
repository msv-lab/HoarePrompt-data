Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)`. If `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements` also has the entry `line[ind]: (0, 1)`. `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input that must have at least two strings, and `ind` is 1. If `line[ind]` represents a player, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the entry `line[ind]: False`. If `line[ind]` does not represent a player and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', `goal` is a list containing two lists, where the first list is empty and the second list contains the tuple `(0, 0)`. If `line[ind]` does not represent a player and the second character of `line[ind]` is not 'G', `goal` is a list containing two empty lists. If `line[ind]` does not represent a player and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[1]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(0, 1)` appended to its existing list. If `line[ind]` is '..', `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary `{}` and `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists.***
