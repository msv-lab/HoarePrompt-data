Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` and `b` are updated to the positive integers provided by the input, and `i` is 2. If `(a - b) % 2` is not equal to 0, the program behaves as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program behaves as specified in the else part.*** 

To clarify further:
- If `(a - b) % 2` is not equal to 0, the conditions from the if part apply.
- If `(a - b) % 2` is equal to 0, the conditions from the else part apply. 

However, since the if and else parts do not specify different behaviors beyond the condition check, the overall postcondition remains consistent with the initial state and the condition check.
