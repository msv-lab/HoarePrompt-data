Postcondition: ***`ops` is a list of tuples derived from `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., up to `(c, ci)`, where `c` is the element at the middle index of `path_ba` and `ci` is the middle index of `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, `(c2, 5)`, ..., `(c1, len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`, `(c2, len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`. In both cases, `n` is the last non-negative value in the `previous` list that leads back to node 0, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to the original `n`, each sublist contains the indices of the nodes connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index, `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes, `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` followed by the sequence of node indices leading back to node 0, including the final value of `n`.***
