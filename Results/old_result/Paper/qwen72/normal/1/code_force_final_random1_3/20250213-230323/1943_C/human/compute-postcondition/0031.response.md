The code snippet appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`.

- `n` remains the same as the initial input integer.
- `u2vs` remains a list of lists with length equal to `n`, each sublist contains the indices of the nodes connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index.
- `d` remains the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes.
- `previous` remains the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node.
- `a` remains the result of `func_1(d)`.
- `b` remains the result of `func_1(d)`.
- `path_ba` now contains the value of `b` and the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` remains the same as the initial input integer, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to `n`, each sublist contains the indices of the nodes connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index, `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes, `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` and the value of `n`.**
