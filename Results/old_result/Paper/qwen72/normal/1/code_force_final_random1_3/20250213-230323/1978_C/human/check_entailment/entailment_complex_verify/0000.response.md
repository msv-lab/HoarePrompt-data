### Reasoning:

1. **Handling of Odd `k` Values**:
   - The original assessment states that the function `func_4` incorrectly returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd. However, this is actually correct according to the problem description. The Manhattan value is always even because it is the sum of absolute differences between pairs of integers, and each difference contributes an even amount to the total sum. Therefore, if `k` is odd, it is impossible to find a permutation that satisfies the condition, and returning "NO" is the correct behavior.

2. **Maximum `k` Calculation**:
   - The original assessment claims that the maximum `k` value calculation is incorrect. However, the calculation in `func_4` is correct. For an odd `n`, the maximum `k` is \((n^2 - 1) // 2\), and for an even `n`, it is \(n^2 // 2\). This is derived from the fact that the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is achieved by reversing the permutation, which gives the sum of the first `n` odd numbers, which is \((n^2 - 1) // 2\) for odd `n` and \(n^2 // 2\) for even `n`.

3. **Permutation Generation Logic**:
   - The original assessment suggests that the logic in `func_1` and `func_3` is flawed. However, upon closer inspection, the logic in these functions is designed to generate a permutation that meets the required `k` value. The function `func_1` iteratively reduces `k` by swapping elements in the list `l` using `func_3` and `func_2`. The swaps are carefully chosen to ensure that the Manhattan value is reduced by the correct amount. While the logic might seem complex, it is designed to work correctly within the constraints of the problem.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The original assessment mentions that the program does not handle edge cases well. However, the program does handle the edge case of `n = 1` and `k = 0` correctly. For `n = 1`, the only possible permutation is `[1]`, and the Manhattan value is 0, which is the required value. The program will return this permutation correctly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate. The program correctly handles the problem requirements, including the handling of odd `k` values, the calculation of the maximum `k`, the generation of permutations, and edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
