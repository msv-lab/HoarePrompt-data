Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 1, `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is `cnt_b[a[i]] - 1`, and the current value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `curr` is incremented by 1, so `curr` changes from 0 to 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
