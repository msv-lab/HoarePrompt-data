Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of the new input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s[:n-1]`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s[:n-1]`, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `lst` is a list containing all indices `i + 1` where the conditions were met during the loop, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` equals `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, and if `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes `0` as its last element. Otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` includes `n` as its last element. If `len(final) != 0`, `final` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `pk = n / 2` updates the value of `pk` to be half of `n`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
