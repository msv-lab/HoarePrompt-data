The code snippet updates the `arr` variable by taking input from the user, converting it into a list of unique integers, sorting it in descending order, and appending a 0 to the end. This operation does not affect the values of `tc`, `t`, `n`, `i`, or `dp`.

Let's break down the changes:

- `arr` is updated to a new list that consists of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0.
- The values of `tc`, `t`, `n`, `i`, and `dp` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`tc` is an input integer where 0 < tc ≤ 10^4 - 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `dp` is `True` if any difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is 0) is greater than 1, otherwise `dp` is `False`.**
