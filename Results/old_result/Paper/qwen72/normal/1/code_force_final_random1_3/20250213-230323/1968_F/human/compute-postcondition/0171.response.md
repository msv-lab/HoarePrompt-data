Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `3 + n + 2 * q + n + 1 + 2 * q + 2`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers initialized to 0, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers initialized to 0, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional empty string at the end, and `i` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- The line `pf = [0] * (n + 1)` initializes the list `pf` to contain `n + 1` zeros.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
