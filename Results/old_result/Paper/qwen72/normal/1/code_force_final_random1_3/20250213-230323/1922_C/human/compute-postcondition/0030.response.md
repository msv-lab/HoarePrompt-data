The code snippet updates the value of `d2[i]` based on the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` and the value of `d2[i + 1]`. Let's break down the impact:

- `d2[i]` is updated to the value of `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.
- The value of `d2[i + 1]` is already known to be 1 (from the initial state).
- Therefore, `d2[i]` becomes `l[i] - l[i - 1] + 1`.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `d1`, and `d2[n - 1]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 where `d2[n - 1]` is 1, and `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + 1`.**
