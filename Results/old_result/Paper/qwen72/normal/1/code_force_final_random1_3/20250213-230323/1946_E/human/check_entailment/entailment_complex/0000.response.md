Reasoning:

1. **Factorial Precomputation**: The program precomputes factorials up to 200,000 and stores them in the list `facts`. This is necessary for efficiently calculating combinations later in the program.

2. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`. It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

3. **Initial Validity Check**: The program checks if the last prefix maximum index is the same as the first suffix maximum index, and if the first prefix maximum index is 1 and the last suffix maximum index is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, indicating no valid permutations exist.

4. **Combination Calculation**: The program uses the `func_2` function to calculate combinations. The `func_2` function, in turn, uses the `func_1` function to compute the modular inverse of `b` modulo 1000000007. This is used to calculate the combination `C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)` modulo 1000000007.

5. **Permutation Counting**:
   - The program iterates over the suffix maximums and calculates the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements.
   - It then iterates over the prefix maximums in reverse order and calculates the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements.
   - Finally, it multiplies the number of ways to arrange the elements between consecutive prefix and suffix maximums.

6. **Modulo Operations**: All intermediate results and the final answer are taken modulo 1000000007 to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

7. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when there are no valid permutations (e.g., when the prefix and suffix maximums do not align).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
