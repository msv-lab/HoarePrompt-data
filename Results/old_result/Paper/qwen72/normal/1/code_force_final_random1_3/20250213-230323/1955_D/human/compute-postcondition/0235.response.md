Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than or equal to its original value, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than `m + 2`, `cnt_b[b[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and other variables remain unchanged. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1.***
