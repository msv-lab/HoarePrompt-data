### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`n`) using `func_1()`. This function should return the number of test cases, but it has a parameter `isOne` which is not used correctly. However, since `isOne` is not passed in the main program, it defaults to `None`, and the function correctly reads the input.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, the program calls `func_7()` to process the constraints and calculate the number of valid integers `k`.

3. **Constraints Processing**:
   - **Type 1 Constraints (k ≥ x)**: The program updates `start` to the maximum value of `x` encountered.
   - **Type 2 Constraints (k ≤ x)**: The program updates `end` to the minimum value of `x` encountered.
   - **Type 3 Constraints (k ≠ x)**: The program adds `x` to the list `num`.

4. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - The program counts the number of elements in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]` and stores this count in `count_num`.
   - If `start` is greater than `end`, the program returns 0, indicating no valid integers.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the number of valid integers as `end - start + 1 - count_num`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` has an unused parameter `isOne`. This is a minor issue since it doesn't affect the functionality when called without the parameter.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `start` is greater than `end`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. The logic is sound and handles all specified constraints and edge cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
