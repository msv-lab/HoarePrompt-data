Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `b` is a new list of integers converted from the new input string, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` where each element `new[j]` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`, and `new2` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` where each element `new2[j]` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to run as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`.
- In each iteration, the `i`-th element of `new` is set to the minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`, and the `i`-th element of `new2` is set to the maximum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to the length of `a`, meaning all elements in `a` and `b` have been processed.
- The lists `new` and `new2` will have no `None` values left, and each element will be the result of the `min` and `max` operations, respectively, applied to the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`.
