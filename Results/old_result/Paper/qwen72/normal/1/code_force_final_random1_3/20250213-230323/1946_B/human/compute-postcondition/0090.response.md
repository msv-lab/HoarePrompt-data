To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` is 1.
- The condition for updating `sm` is based on the values of `suf[i] - smin[i]` and `sm`, but these are not part of the loop head and thus do not affect the loop's execution directly.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The variable `i` must be incremented by 1, as it is the loop counter.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented to 2.
- For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 (since `i` must be less than `n + 1`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `sm` remains unchanged unless `suf[i] - smin[i] > sm` or `sm == -111`**.
