isOne is a boolean value (True or False). However, this function definition does not match the problem description provided. The function should take a list of constraints and return the number of integers k that satisfy all constraints. A correct function definition would be something like `def count_satisfying_integers(constraints):` where `constraints` is a list of tuples, each representing a constraint.
