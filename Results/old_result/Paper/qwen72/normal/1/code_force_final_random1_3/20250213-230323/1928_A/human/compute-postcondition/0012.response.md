Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` and `b` are updated to the positive integers provided by the input, `i` is 0, and the input value must be a positive integer. Additionally, either `a` is odd or `b` is odd, and the condition \((a - b == -a, a)\) or \((b - a == -b, b)\) is false. If the difference between `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2 (i.e., `(a - b) % 2` is either greater than 0 or less than 0), then the difference remains non-divisible by 2. Otherwise, if the difference between `a` and `b` is divisible by 2 (i.e., `(a - b) % 2` is equal to 0), then the difference remains divisible by 2.***
