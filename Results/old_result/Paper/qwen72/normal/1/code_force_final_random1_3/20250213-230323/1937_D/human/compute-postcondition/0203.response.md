Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `l` is the number of '>' characters in `s`, and `r` is 0. The values of `s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will have iterated through all indices from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, `i` will be `n-1` at the end of the loop.
- **`l`**: `l` is incremented each time the loop encounters a '>' character. Since the loop processes the entire string `s`, `l` will be equal to the total number of '>' characters in `s` by the end of the loop.
- **`r`**: `r` is decremented each time the loop encounters a '<' character. Since the loop processes the entire string `s`, `r` will be decremented to 0 by the end of the loop because it starts as the number of '<' characters in `s`.
- **Other Variables**: The values of `s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` are not modified within the loop, so they remain unchanged.
