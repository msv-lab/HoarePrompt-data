Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is 1, `j` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 'YES'. If `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.***
