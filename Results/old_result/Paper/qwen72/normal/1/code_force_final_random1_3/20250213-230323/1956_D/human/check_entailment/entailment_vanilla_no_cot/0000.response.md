Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
- The function `func_2` calls `recursive_maximize_sum` but does not pass the `ops` list, which is required by `func_1`. This will cause an error because `func_1` expects `ops` as an argument.
- The condition in `func_1` where it checks `if a[l] != r - l + 1:` is incorrect. The MEX value is not necessarily `r - l + 1`, but rather the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.
- The logic in `recursive_maximize_sum` is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that the sum of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` being less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` means that the MEX can be directly set to `r - l + 1`. This is not always true, as the MEX depends on the actual values in the subarray.
- The function `func_3` reads input and prints output correctly, but the underlying logic in `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum` needs to be corrected to properly compute the MEX and apply the operations.

To fix these issues, the functions need to be revised to correctly compute the MEX and apply the operations in a way that maximizes the sum of the array.
