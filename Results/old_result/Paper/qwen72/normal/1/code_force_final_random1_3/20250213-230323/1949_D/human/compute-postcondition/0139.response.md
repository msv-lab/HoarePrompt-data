To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which in this case are `j` and `n`.

### Given:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24
- `j` is 2
- `nx` is determined based on the conditions provided.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is the upper bound of the loop and does not change within the loop.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is incremented to 3.
- `n` remains the same (2 ≤ n ≤ 24).

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3, and `nx` is determined as follows: If the character at position `[1][1]` in the array `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is the character at position `[1][1]` in the array `xx` concatenated with itself. If the character at position `[1][1]` in the array `xx` is '?', then `nx` is 'F' if either `i` (1) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `j` (3) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.**
