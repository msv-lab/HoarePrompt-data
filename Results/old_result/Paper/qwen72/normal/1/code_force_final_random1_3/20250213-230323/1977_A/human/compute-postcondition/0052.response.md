Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 100`. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100) from the input. It then evaluates the following conditions for each pair of `n` and `m`:
- If `n` equals `m`, it prints 'Yes'.
- If `m` is greater than `n`, it prints 'No'.
- If `m` is `n - 1`, it prints 'Yes'.
- If both `m` and `n` are even, it prints 'Yes'.
- If both `m` and `n` are odd, it prints 'Yes'.
- Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the appropriate output ('Yes' or 'No') has been printed for each test case. **
