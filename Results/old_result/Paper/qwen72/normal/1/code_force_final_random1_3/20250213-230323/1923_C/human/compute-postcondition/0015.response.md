Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing the elements [0, `i`], `c` is a list containing the elements [0, `j`]. If `x` == 1, then `j` is incremented by 1 (if `j` was 0, it becomes 1; if `j` was 1, it becomes 2). Otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.***
