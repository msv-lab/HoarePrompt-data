Output State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb` remain unchanged, `nx` is an empty string, `i` is `n + 1`**

Explanation:
- The code `nx = ''` sets the variable `nx` to an empty string.
- All other variables (`j`, `n`, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
