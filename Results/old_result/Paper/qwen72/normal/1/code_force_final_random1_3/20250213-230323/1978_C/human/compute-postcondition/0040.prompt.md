Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the required Manhattan value such that 0 <= k <= 5 * 10^11 (k is now k // 2), `l` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if k == 0:
        return l
    if 1 + i > k:
        x = l[-1]
        l.pop(-1)
        l.insert(-k, x)
        return l
    k = k - i + 1
    x = l[-1]
    l.pop(-1)
    l.insert(0, x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is `k - n + 2`, `1 + i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is the list with `x` inserted at the beginning, and `x` is no longer the last element of the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is `k - n + 3`, `1 + i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` has `x` inserted at the beginning, and `x` is now the first element of the list `l`. If `1 + i > k`, the list `l` is modified to insert `x` at the position `-k` from the end, and `x` is no longer at the end of the list `l`. If `k` is 0, the list `l` is returned as modified.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `k` is `k - n + 4`, `1 + i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` has `x` inserted at the beginning, if `1 + i` is greater than `k`, `x` is inserted at the position `-k` (which is `n - 3 - k`) from the end of the list `l`, and `x` is no longer at the beginning of the list `l`, if `k` is 0, the list `l` is returned with `x` inserted at the beginning, and the last element of the list `l` has been removed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
