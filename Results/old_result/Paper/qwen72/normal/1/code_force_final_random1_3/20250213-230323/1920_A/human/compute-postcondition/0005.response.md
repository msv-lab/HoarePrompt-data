The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `t` and `v`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `start`, `end`, `num`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, `t` and `v` are input integers.**
