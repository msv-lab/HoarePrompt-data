Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `_` is 2.**

Explanation: The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers read from the input. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `x`, and `_`) remain unchanged.
