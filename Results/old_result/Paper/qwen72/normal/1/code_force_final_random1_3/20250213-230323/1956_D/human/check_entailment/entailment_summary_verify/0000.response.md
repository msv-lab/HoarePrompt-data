### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the results.
   - The function summary indicates that it correctly handles the input and output format, and the input variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged after the function call.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function initializes the `ops` list and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` with the entire array.
   - The function returns the sum of the modified array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
   - The original assessment points out that `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the `ops` list, which is indeed a mistake. This will result in a `NameError` because `ops` is not defined within the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function is supposed to recursively maximize the sum of the array segment `[l, r]`.
   - The condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):` is intended to check if the sum of the segment is less than or equal to the maximum possible sum of the segment. However, this condition alone is not sufficient to ensure that the MEX operation is applied correctly.
   - The MEX operation should be applied to the segment `[l, r]` to maximize the sum, but the current logic does not guarantee that the MEX value is correctly computed and applied.
   - For example, consider the input `3 1 2 3`. The expected output is `6 0`, but the provided code will not handle this case correctly because the MEX operation is not applied in a way that maximizes the sum.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for applying the MEX operation to the segment `[l, r]` and updating the array and the operations list.
   - The function correctly handles the base case where `l == r` and updates the array and operations list accordingly.
   - However, the recursive call to `func_1` and the subsequent update of the array and operations list are not guaranteed to maximize the sum correctly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program has logical issues in the `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum` functions, specifically:
- The `ops` list is not passed to `recursive_maximize_sum`, leading to a `NameError`.
- The logic in `recursive_maximize_sum` does not correctly compute and apply the MEX operation to maximize the sum of the array segment.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
