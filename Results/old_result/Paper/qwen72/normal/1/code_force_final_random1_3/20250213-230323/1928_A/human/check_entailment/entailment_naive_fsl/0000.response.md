Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining whether a rectangle can be transformed into another distinct rectangle is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

- **Input**: `2 4`
- **Expected Output**: `Yes`
- **Actual Output**: `no`

According to the problem description, a 2x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 4x2 rectangle, which is considered different from the original 2x4 rectangle. However, the program incorrectly outputs `no` for this case.

The issue lies in the conditions used to determine the output. The conditions are overly complex and do not accurately reflect the logic required to solve the problem. A simpler and more accurate approach would be to check if either dimension of the rectangle is even, as this would allow for a valid cut and rearrangement into a different rectangle.
