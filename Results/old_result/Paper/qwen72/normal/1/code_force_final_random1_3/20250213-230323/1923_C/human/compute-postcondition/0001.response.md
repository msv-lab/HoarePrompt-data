The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `n` and `m`, respectively. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `_` is 0. After executing the code, the values of `n` and `m` are updated based on the input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers read from input.**
