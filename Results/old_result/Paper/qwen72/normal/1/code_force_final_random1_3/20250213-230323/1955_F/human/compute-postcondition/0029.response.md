Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in `a`**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `int(input())` must be greater than 0, which remains unchanged.
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `a` to be a list of integers entered by the user.
- The variable `cnt` is still defined as the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in `a`, but since `a` has been updated, `cnt` will be recalculated based on the new values in `a`. However, the exact value of `cnt` is not specified in the output state because it depends on the new values in `a`.
- The initial state's condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 0 remains valid and unchanged.
