Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Condition for Odd Elements**: The condition `if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2)` is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made all zeros. This condition only checks the first and last elements and their immediate neighbors, which is not enough to ensure the entire array can be reduced to zero.

2. **Sum of Elements**: The key insight to solve this problem is that the sum of the elements in the array must be even. This is because each operation decreases the sum of the array by 4 (since \(a_{i-1}\), \(a_i\), and \(a_{i+1}\) are decreased by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, which totals to 4).

3. **Feasibility Check**: Additionally, the array can be made all zeros if and only if the sum of the elements is even and the array can be partitioned such that the operations can be applied without creating negative numbers.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the sum of the array is even
        if sum(a) % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if the array can be made all zeros
        prefix_sum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] < prefix_sum:
                print('NO')
                break
            prefix_sum += a[i] - (prefix_sum // 2) * 2
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the sum of the array is even and checks if the array can be made all zeros by maintaining a prefix sum and ensuring no element becomes negative during the process.
