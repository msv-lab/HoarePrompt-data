### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_10` to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, `func_15` is called to compute the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

2. **Function `func_15`**:
   - This function reads `n` and `m` using `func_7`.
   - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates while `i * i <= n + i` and updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for each `i`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The problem requires counting pairs `(a, b)` such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The function `func_15` does not directly implement this logic. Instead, it seems to be calculating something related to the sum of certain divisions, which does not align with the problem statement.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The function `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs `(a, b)` as described in the problem statement.
   - The logic inside `func_15` is not aligned with the problem requirements, and there is no clear connection between the calculations performed and the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
