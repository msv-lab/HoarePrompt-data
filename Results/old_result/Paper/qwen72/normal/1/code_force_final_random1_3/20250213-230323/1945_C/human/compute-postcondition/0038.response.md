Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `pk` is set to `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is 2 and `one` is 0. If `s[i]` is '1', `zero` is 1 and `one` is 1. In both cases, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // 3`, and `one_perc` is \((o - one) * 100 // (n - 2)\). If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is [1, 2]. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `zero_perc` to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`.
- Since `i` is 2, `i + 1` is 3.
- Therefore, `zero_perc` is now calculated as `zero * 100 // 3`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
