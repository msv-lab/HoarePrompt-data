Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 3 characters, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus 97. If the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` was 0, `cur` is updated to include the bit at position `cur_ss` set to 1. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1` after this update, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` contains the value of `cur_ss`, and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.***
