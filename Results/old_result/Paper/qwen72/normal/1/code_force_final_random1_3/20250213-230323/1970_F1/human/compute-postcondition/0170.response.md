Output State: **`obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element, `el` is the third element.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `obj, com, el = command` unpacks the first three elements of the list `command` into the variables `obj`, `com`, and `el`. This means that `obj` now holds the first element of `command`, `com` holds the second element, and `el` holds the third element. All other conditions and variables mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged.
