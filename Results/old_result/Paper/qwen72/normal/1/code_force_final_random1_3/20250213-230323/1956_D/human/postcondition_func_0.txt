The function `func_1` modifies a list `a` and updates a list `ops` based on the values within a specified range `[l, r]` of `a`. If `l` equals `r` and `a[l]` is not zero, it sets `a[l]` to zero and appends the tuple `(l, l)` to `ops`. If `l` is not equal to `r` and `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it sets all elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and appends the tuple `(l, r)` to `ops`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `a` may have been modified, and `ops` may contain additional tuples depending on the conditions met during execution.
