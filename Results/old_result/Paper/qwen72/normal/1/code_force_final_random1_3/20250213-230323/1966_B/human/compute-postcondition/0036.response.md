To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `tc` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings.
- `i` is 1.
- The first character of the first string in `gr` is different from the last character of the last string in `gr`.
- `j` is `m-2`.
- `ans` is 'NO'.
- If `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range `range(n - 1)`, which means `i` starts at 0 and goes up to `n - 2`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
- The loop condition `i < n - 1` must still be true for the loop to continue.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- The loop condition `i < n - 1` must be true, so `n` must be greater than 3.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `m` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is 2, the first character of the first string in `gr` is different from the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is `m-2`, `ans` is 'NO', if `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.**
