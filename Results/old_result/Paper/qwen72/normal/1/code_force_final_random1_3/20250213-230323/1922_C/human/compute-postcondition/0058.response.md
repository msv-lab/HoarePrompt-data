The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer provided by the user, which is greater than 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 where `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is an input integer, `j` is `m-1`, and `x` and `y` are integers provided by the last user input.**
