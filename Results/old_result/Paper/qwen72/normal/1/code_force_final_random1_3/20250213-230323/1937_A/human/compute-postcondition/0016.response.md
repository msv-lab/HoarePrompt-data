Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `power - 1`.
   - `power` is `n + 1`.
   - The current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - From the initial state, we know that `power` is defined as `n + 1`.
   - However, it is also stated that the current value of `power` is equal to `n`.
   - This implies that `n + 1` must be equal to `n`, which is a contradiction unless `n` is a special value like infinity or a floating-point representation issue. But in typical integer arithmetic, this is not possible.

3. **Resolving the Contradiction:**
   - Given the contradiction, we need to interpret the initial state in a way that makes sense. The most reasonable interpretation is that `power` is indeed `n + 1`, but the statement "the current value of `power` is equal to `n`" might be a mistake or a special case.
   - For the purpose of this task, we will assume that `power` is `n + 1`.

4. **Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet is `print(2 ** power)`.
   - We need to determine the value of `2 ** power`.

5. **Calculating the Output:**
   - Since `power` is `n + 1`, the expression `2 ** power` becomes `2 ** (n + 1)`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the value of `2 ** (n + 1)`.

Output: **2 ** (n + 1) (where n is the value of n and power is n + 1)**
