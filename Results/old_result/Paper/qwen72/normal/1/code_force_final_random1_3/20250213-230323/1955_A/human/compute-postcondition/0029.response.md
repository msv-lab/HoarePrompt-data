The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters within its definition. However, based on the context provided, it is implied that the function might process some internal or predefined data related to the constraints given (t, n, a, b). The constraints indicate that `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers within specified ranges. Given this, the function likely processes these values internally.

Since the specific output is not detailed in the provided information, I will infer based on common practices in such functions. Typically, such a function would return results for each test case, possibly a list of results corresponding to each set of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves integers `n`, `a`, and `b` within specified ranges. It returns a result for each test case, likely a list of results corresponding to each set of `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
