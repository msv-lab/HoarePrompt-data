Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string with at least three characters, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[2]) - ord('a')`, and `ss` is the third character in the string `s`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. If `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the second character of `s`, and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `ans` remains an empty string, and `cur` remains `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss != 0`, then `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged.***
