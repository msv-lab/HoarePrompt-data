The code `set_ = list(set(arr))` creates a new list `set_` that contains only the unique elements from the list `arr`.

- `arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive.
- The first element of `arr` is 1.
- `A` is `False`.

After executing the code, `set_` will contain the unique elements from `arr` in an unspecified order. The length of `set_` will be less than or equal to the length of `arr`, and it will include the number 1 since the first element of `arr` is 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive; `A` is `False`; `set_` is a list containing the unique elements from `arr`, including the number 1.**
