Output State: **`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `rest` is `rest - delta`, `pos` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` may be updated depending on the condition, `distance` remains unchanged, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` retain their initial values, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`.**

Explanation:
- `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`.
- `rest` is updated to `rest - delta`.
- `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decremented by `delta`.
- `pos` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` may still be updated depending on further conditions, but this is not affected by the current code snippet.
- `distance` remains unchanged.
- `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` retain their initial values.
- `rest` must be greater than 0, and `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`.
