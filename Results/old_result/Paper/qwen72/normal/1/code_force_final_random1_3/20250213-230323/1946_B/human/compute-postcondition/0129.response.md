The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, if `i` was some value `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be `x + 1`. Since `n` is greater than 0 and the loop condition is `i < n`, `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i` for the loop to continue.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `smin` has been updated according to the conditions described in the task.**
