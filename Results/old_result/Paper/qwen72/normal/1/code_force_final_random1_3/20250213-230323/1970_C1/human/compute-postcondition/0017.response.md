Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, and `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element `(x-1)` times. The values of `a` and `b` will vary for each iteration based on the user input. The initial state of the tree and the initial position of the stone remain unchanged. `z` is an input integer.**
