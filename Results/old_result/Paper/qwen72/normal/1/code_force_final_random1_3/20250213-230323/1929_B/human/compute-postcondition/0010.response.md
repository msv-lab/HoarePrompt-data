Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration.
- `n` is the first integer from the new input.
- `k` is the second integer from the new input.
- The condition \(4 \times n - 2\) equals `k` or does not equal `k` based on the new values of `n` and `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `k` and `n`:**
   - `n` and `k` are integers derived from new input.
   - The condition \(4 \times n - 2 = k\) or \(4 \times n - 2 \neq k\) is given, but it doesn't directly affect the calculation in the `print` statement.

2. **Expression `k // 2 + 1`:**
   - `k // 2` performs integer division of `k` by 2.
   - Adding 1 to the result of `k // 2` gives the final value to be printed.

### Calculation:
- Let's denote the value of `k` as \( k \).
- The expression `k // 2` will give the integer part of \( \frac{k}{2} \).
- Adding 1 to this result gives \( \left\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \right\rfloor + 1 \).

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of \( \left\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \right\rfloor + 1 \).

Output: **\(\left\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \right\rfloor + 1\) (where \( k \) is the second integer from the new input)**
