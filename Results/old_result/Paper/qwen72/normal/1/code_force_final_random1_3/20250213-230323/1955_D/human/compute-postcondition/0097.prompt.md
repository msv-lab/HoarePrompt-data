Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers read from input, `i` has iterated through all elements in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 with all elements in `b_values` having their corresponding `cnt_b` values set to 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `b` is a list of integers read from input, `max_val` is 1000000, and `curr` is the number of elements in `a[n-m:n]` that are also in `b_values` and whose corresponding `cnt_b` value is non-negative. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is the total number of valid subarrays found during the loop execution. Otherwise, `ans` is the total number of valid subarrays found minus one.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    cnt_b[b[i]] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
