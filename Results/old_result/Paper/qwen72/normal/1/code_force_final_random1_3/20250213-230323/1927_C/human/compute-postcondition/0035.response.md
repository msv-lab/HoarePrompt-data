Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2. If `i` (which is 2) is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` (which is 2) is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
