### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q` which represent the final destination, the number of known time points, and the number of queries, respectively.
   - It initializes lists `a` and `b` with the positions and times, respectively, and adds a zero at the beginning to handle the starting point.

2. **Calculating Differences:**
   - The program calculates the differences in positions (`ad`) and times (`bd`) between consecutive points. This is necessary to determine the speed between each pair of points.

3. **Speed Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the speed `v` between each pair of points using the formula `v[i] = ad[i] / bd[i]`.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment in which the query point `ql` lies.
   - If the query point `ql` is exactly at one of the known points, it directly prints the corresponding time.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the time to reach `ql` by adding the time to the previous known point and the time to travel the remaining distance within the current segment.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the query point is exactly at one of the known points by directly printing the corresponding time.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the query point is between two known points by calculating the time based on the speed in that segment.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each query, ensuring that the time is rounded down to the nearest integer.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles all the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: **True****
