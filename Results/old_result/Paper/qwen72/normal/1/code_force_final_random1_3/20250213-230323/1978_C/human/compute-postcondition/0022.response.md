Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is now `k - (n - 2) + 1`, `l` is the result of `func_3(2, l)`, `i` is `n - 4`, `k` is greater than or equal to `(n - 2) - 1`, and `c` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `l`, `i`) retain their values as specified in the initial state.
