Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `b` is a new list of integers converted from the new input string, `i` is less than the length of `a` and has been incremented by 1, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except for the first `i-1` elements which are now `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-2`, the `i-1`-th element is now `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, and the `i`-th element is now `min(a[i], b[i])`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except for the first `i-1` elements which are now `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-2`, the `i-1`-th element is now `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, and the `i`-th element is now `max(a[i], b[i])`.**
