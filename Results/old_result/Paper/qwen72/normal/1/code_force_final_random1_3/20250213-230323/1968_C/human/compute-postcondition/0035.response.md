Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 except `a[0]` which is 1000, and `i` is `n`. The value of `a[n]` is now `a[n-1] + x[n-1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `a[i]` to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`.
- Given that `i` is `n`, the value of `a[n]` is updated to `a[n-1] + x[n-1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
