t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and q are integers where k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 10^5, representing the final destination, the number of known time points, and the number of queries, respectively. a is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1, and a_k = n, representing the positions of the known time points. b is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1, representing the times at which the car reaches the known points. Each query d is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ n, representing the distance for which the time is queried. The sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
