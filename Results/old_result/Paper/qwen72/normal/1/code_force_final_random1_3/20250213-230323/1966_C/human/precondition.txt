t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of piles. Each pile contains a positive integer number of stones a_i such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
