Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`. If `impossible` is `True` (because at least one pair of consecutive strings in `gr` has different first or last characters), `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.***
