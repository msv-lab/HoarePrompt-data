Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `1` is in `lis`, the length of `lis` is greater than 1, `j` is the last index of `lis` (which is `len(lis) - 1`). No pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1, and `test` is True.**
