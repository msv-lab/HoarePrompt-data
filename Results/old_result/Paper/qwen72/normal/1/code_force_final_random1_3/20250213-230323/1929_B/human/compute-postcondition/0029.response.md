Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers derived from the input file. The loop has processed all lines of the input file, and for each test case, the appropriate output has been printed based on the conditions: if `k` is less than or equal to 4 * n - 4, the value `math.ceil(k / 2)` has been printed; if `k` is exactly 4 * n - 3, the value `2 * n - 1` has been printed; if `k` is 4 * n - 2, the value `2 * n` has been printed. The loop has completed its execution, and no further lines are left to process.**
