Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `numbers[i]` ≤ 10^9, sorted in descending order, `group_a` contains the first `na` elements of `numbers`, `group_b` contains the next `nb` elements of `numbers`, `group_c` contains the last `nc` elements of `numbers`, `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in `group_a`, `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in `group_b`, and `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in `group_c`.**
