You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, representing the number of cells. a is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing whether the cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1). At least one cell contains a chip in each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: _ is t-1, t is greater than or equal to 1, n is an input integer, arr is a string containing the final input with all spaces removed, x is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the final arr or -1 if '1' is not found, y is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string of the final arr or -1 if '1' is not found, z is the substring of the final arr starting from index x and ending at index n - y - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a series of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1), representing cells that are either free (0) or contain a chip (1). For each test case, the function identifies the segment of the list that starts from the first cell containing a chip to the last cell containing a chip. It then counts the number of free cells (0s) within this segment and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where there are no free cells between the chips but the chips are not contiguous. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 0 1 0 1
```

The expected output is `2`, as we need to move the chips to form a single block. However, the current implementation will output `1`, which is incorrect. The program only counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, but it does not account for the fact that the chips might not be contiguous and require multiple moves to form a single block.
