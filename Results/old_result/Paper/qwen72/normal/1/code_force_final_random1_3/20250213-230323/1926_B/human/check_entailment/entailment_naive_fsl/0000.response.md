Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it only checks the first two rows of the grid to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle. This approach fails for several scenarios:

1. **Upside-down Triangle**: The program does not account for an upside-down triangle. For example, consider the following grid:
   ```
   0000
   0000
   1110
   0100
   ```
   This is an upside-down triangle, but the program will incorrectly identify it as a triangle because it only checks the first two rows.

2. **Non-central Triangles**: The program assumes that the central 1s are located in one column, but it does not verify this. For example, consider the following grid:
   ```
   0000
   0100
   0110
   0111
   ```
   This is a valid triangle, but the program will incorrectly identify it as a square because it only checks the number of 1s in the first two rows.

3. **Non-square Shapes with Equal First Two Rows**: The program will incorrectly identify shapes that have the same number of 1s in the first two rows but are not squares. For example, consider the following grid:
   ```
   0000
   1100
   1100
   0000
   ```
   This is not a square, but the program will incorrectly identify it as a square.

To ensure the program is correct, it needs to verify the entire grid and check for both the structure of a triangle and a square, including handling upside-down triangles and ensuring the central 1s are aligned correctly.
