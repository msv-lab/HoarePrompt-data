The function `func_1` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet, but based on the problem description, it is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving an array and several queries about segments of this array. The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by the number of elements in an array (`n`) and the number of queries (`q`). For each query, which is defined by two indices (`l` and `r`), the function computes a result based on the segment of the array from index `l` to `r`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with an array of integers and a set of queries. It accepts the number of test cases, the size of the array, the array itself, and the queries. For each query, it returns a result based on the specified segment of the array.**
