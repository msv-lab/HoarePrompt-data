Postcondition: ***`feat` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list and must be greater than 0, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` must be less than `test_cases`. If `i` is 0 and `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains the value `arr[0] * a`. If `i` is 0 and `arr[0]` is not less than `b / a`, then `array2` remains an empty list. If `i` is not 0 and the difference between the current element `arr[i]` and the previous element `arr[i - 1]` in the `arr` list is less than the result of dividing `b` by `a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. If `i` is not 0 and the difference between the current element `arr[i]` and the previous element `arr[i - 1]` in the `arr` list is not less than the result of dividing `b` by `a`, then `array2` remains an empty list.***
