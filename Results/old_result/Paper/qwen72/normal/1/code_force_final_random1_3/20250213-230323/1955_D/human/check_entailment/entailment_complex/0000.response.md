Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The function initializes `cnt_b` as a list of zeros with a length of `max_val + 1` (1,000,001). This is used to keep track of the frequency of elements in `b`. The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

3. **Counting Elements in `b`**: It initializes the `cnt_b` list to count the occurrences of each element in `b`.

4. **Initial Window Check**: It sets up an initial window of size `m` in `a` and checks how many elements in this window are in `b` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b`. If the count of such elements (`curr`) is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

5. **Sliding Window**: The function then slides the window one position to the right for each subsequent position in `a` and updates the count of elements in `b` within the current window. It adjusts the count of the element that is leaving the window and the element that is entering the window. If the count of elements in the current window that are in `b` and have a non-negative count in `cnt_b` is still greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans`.

6. **Resetting Counts**: After processing each test case, it resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b` to zero to prepare for the next test case.

7. **Output**: The function prints the number of good subsegments for each test case.

**Correctness Analysis**:
- The function correctly handles the input and output format.
- It uses a sliding window approach to efficiently count the number of good subsegments.
- The logic for updating the count of elements in the current window and checking if the window is good is correct.
- The function resets the necessary variables between test cases to avoid interference.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
