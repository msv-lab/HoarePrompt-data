Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first input integer - 2 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second input integer - 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is `na_frente` and is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` is 10^12.***
