Reasoning: 

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step.

### Problem Understanding
The problem requires constructing a permutation `p` from an array `a` where each element `a[i]` is defined as `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`. The goal is to find a valid permutation `p` that satisfies this condition.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to construct the permutation `p` by iterating backward through the array `a` and using a variable `mex` to track the minimum excluded value (MEX).

### Key Points in the Program
1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized to `n` (the length of the array).
   - `res` is initialized as a list of `None` with length `n`.

2. **Backward Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates from the last index to the first index of `ar`.
   - For each index `i`, it sets `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]`.
   - If `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, it updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Output**:
   - The constructed permutation `res` is printed.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it fails to handle the construction of the permutation `p` correctly. Specifically, it provides an example where the program outputs an incorrect permutation.

### Example Analysis
Let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
- **Input**: `1 5 1 1 -2 1 2`
- **Expected Output**: `0 1 4 2 3`
- **Actual Output**: `0 1 2 3 4`

#### Step-by-Step Execution
1. **Initial State**:
   - `n = 5`
   - `ar = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
   - `res = [None, None, None, None, None]`
   - `mex = 5`

2. **Backward Iteration**:
   - **i = 4**: `res[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = 3`
   - **i = 3**: `res[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`
   - **i = 2**: `res[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = 4`
   - **i = 1**: `res[1] = 4 - 1 = 3`, but `mex` should not be updated here because `mex` is already 2.
   - **i = 0**: `res[0] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = 1`

3. **Final State**:
   - `res = [1, 3, 4, 2, 3]` (which is incorrect)

### Correctness Evaluation
The program's logic for updating `mex` and constructing `res` is indeed flawed. The issue lies in the incorrect handling of the `mex` value and the construction of the permutation `p`. The program does not correctly account for the MEX calculation and the relationship between `a[i]` and `p[i]`.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` in all cases, leading to incorrect outputs.

Final: **False**
