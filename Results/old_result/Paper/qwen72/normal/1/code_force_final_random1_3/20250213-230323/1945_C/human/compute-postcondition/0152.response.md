Output State: **`lst` is an empty list, `t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a new input string, `sl` is a list of characters from the new `s`, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum of the original `mini` and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (n - 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // 1`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If the length of `final` is 0, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, and if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes the element 0. Otherwise, `final` includes the value `n`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `lst = []` initializes `lst` as an empty list.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `pk`, `o`, `z`, `mini`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `final`, `c1`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
