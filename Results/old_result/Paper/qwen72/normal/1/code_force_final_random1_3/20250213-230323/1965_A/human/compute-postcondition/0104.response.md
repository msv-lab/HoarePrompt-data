The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `lis`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `lis`. If `j` is less than the length of `lis`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 (so `j` is 3), and `lis` must have at least 4 elements.

State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 4 elements, `j` is 3, `test` is True**
