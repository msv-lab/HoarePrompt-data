Initial State: 
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.
- `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in `a`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. The user is prompted to enter an integer greater than 0. This integer represents the number of elements in the list `a`.
2. The user then enters a list of integers, which are stored in the list `a`.
3. For each element `x` in the list `a`, the expression `math.floor(x / 2)` is evaluated. This means that each element `x` is divided by 2, and the result is rounded down to the nearest integer.
4. The results of these operations are summed up to get the value of `cnt`.
5. The `print(cnt)` statement outputs the value of `cnt`.

Since the exact values of the elements in the list `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, we can describe the process and the expected output based on the given conditions.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of math.floor(x / 2) for all elements x in the list a)**
