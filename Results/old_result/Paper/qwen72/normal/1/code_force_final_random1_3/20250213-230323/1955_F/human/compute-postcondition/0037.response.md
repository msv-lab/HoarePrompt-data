The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element of `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 3 elements, and `x` will be the third element of `a`.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `a`, `cnt` is increased by `math.floor(x / 2)`**
