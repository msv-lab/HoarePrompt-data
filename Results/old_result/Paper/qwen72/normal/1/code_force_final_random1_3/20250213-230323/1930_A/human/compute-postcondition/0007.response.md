Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `score` is now equal to the sum of the first and third elements of `l`, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet `score += l[i]` adds the value of the third element of the list `l` (since `i` is 2) to the current value of `score`. Initially, `score` was equal to the first element of `l`. After executing the code, `score` is now the sum of the first and third elements of `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
