Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

    for _ in range(int(input())):

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9. For each iteration, `a` and `b` are lists of integers converted from the input strings `x` and `y`, respectively. The lists `new` and `new2` are generated for each pair of `a` and `b` such that: 
    #- `new` contains the maximum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`, and the minimum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` from the first index where `a[i] != b[i]` to the end of the list.
    #- `new2` contains the minimum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`, and the maximum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` from the first index where `a[i] != b[i]` to the end of the list.
