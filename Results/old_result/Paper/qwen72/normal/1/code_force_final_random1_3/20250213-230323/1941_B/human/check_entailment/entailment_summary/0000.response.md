Reasoning:  
The logic in the provided program is flawed. The conditions checked in the program do not fully capture the requirements of the problem. Specifically, the program only checks the first and last elements of the array along with their immediate neighbors, which is insufficient to determine if the entire array can be reduced to zeros using the specified operations.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following points:
1. The operation reduces the values at indices \(i-1\), \(i\), and \(i+1\) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
2. For the array to be reduced to all zeros, the total sum of the array must be even because each operation reduces the sum by 4 (an even number).
3. Additionally, the array must be such that the cumulative effect of the operations can balance out the values to zero without leaving any non-zero residues.

The provided program does not check the total sum of the array or ensure that the operations can be applied in a way that balances all elements to zero. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
