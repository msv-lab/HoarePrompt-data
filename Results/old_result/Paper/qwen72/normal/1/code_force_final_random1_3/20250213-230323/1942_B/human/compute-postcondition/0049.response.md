Postcondition: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers derived from the user input and must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements where `res[-1]` is now `mex - ar[-1]`, `mex` is `n - ar[-1]` if `mex > mex - ar[-1]` (which simplifies to `ar[-1] > 0`), and `i` is -1.**
