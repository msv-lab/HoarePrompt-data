Output State: **`ops` is an empty list, `n` is the last non-negative value in the `previous` list that leads back to node 0, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to the original `n`, each sublist contains the indices of the nodes connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index, `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes, `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` followed by the sequence of node indices leading back to node 0, including the final value of `n`. If the final value of `n` is -1, it indicates that the path has been fully traced back to the starting node 0.**
