The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. These values are read using the `map` function which applies the `int` function to each element in the input split by spaces.

Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated based on the input. The other variables such as `_`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `max_val`, and `cnt_b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder for iterating over a range determined by a positive integer input, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 (values are taken from input), `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of length 1000001 initialized with all elements set to 0, and the input must be a positive integer.**
