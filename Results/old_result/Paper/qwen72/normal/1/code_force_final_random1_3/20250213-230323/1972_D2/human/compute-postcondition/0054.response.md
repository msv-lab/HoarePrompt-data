Output State: **`x` is 5, `y` is 5, `cnt` is the sum of the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1. `n` is at least 32, and `m` is at least 25.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is incremented by 1, changing from 4 to 5.
- The values of `y`, `cnt`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- The conditions and the calculation for `cnt` remain the same, as they are not affected by the increment of `x`.
