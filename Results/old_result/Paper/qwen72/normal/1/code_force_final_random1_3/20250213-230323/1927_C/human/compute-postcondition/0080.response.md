Postcondition: ***`t` is `t + 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `b` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 1. If `i` (which is 1) is present in both lists `a` and `b`, then: if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is set to 1 and `bOnes` is greater than `aOnes`; otherwise, `aOnes` is set to 0 and `bOnes` is set to 1, with `aOnes` being greater than or equal to `bOnes`. If `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`, then: if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is set to 1; otherwise, `aOnes` remains 0. Similarly, if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is set to 1; otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
