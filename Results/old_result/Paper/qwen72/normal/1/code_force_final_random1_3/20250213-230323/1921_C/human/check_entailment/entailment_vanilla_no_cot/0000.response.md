Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The logic in the provided program is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:` is used to decide whether to add the charge consumption between two consecutive messages to the `array2` list. However, this condition does not correctly capture the scenario where Stepan should turn off and on the phone to save charge.

The correct approach should consider the following:
1. Calculate the total charge required to keep the phone on from one message to the next.
2. Determine if it is more efficient to turn off and on the phone between messages.
3. Ensure that the total charge required (including the cost of turning the phone off and on) does not exceed the initial charge `f`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initial charge after the first message
        remaining_charge = f - arr[0] * a
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            # Charge needed to stay on from the previous message to the current one
            charge_needed = (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a
            
            # If turning off and on is cheaper, do it
            if charge_needed > b:
                remaining_charge -= b
            else:
                remaining_charge -= charge_needed
            
            # Check if the remaining charge is sufficient
            if remaining_charge <= 0:
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('Yes')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the phone is turned off and on only when it is more efficient to do so, and it correctly checks if the remaining charge is sufficient to send all messages.
