Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `9 + n`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and is greater than or equal to 2, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the value associated with `pf[r]` in the dictionary `mp` or an empty list if `pf[r]` is not a key in `mp`, `v2` is the value associated with `pf[l - 1]` in the dictionary `mp` or an empty list if `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost element in `v1` that is greater than or equal to `l`, `it2` is the index of the rightmost element in `v2` that is less than `r`, `it2` is now `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If `x == 0`, the `results` list contains the string 'YES', and the program skips the rest of the current iteration. Otherwise, the `results` list may contain the string 'NO' depending on the conditions `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, `v1[it1] <= r`, and `v2[it2] >= l`.**

Explanation:
- The code `v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])` updates the value of `v2` to be the value associated with `pf[l - 1]` in the dictionary `mp`. If `pf[l - 1]` is not a key in `mp`, `v2` is set to an empty list.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
