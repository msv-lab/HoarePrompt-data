To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Given Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `tc` is an input integer where 0 < tc ≤ 10^4 - 2
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is greater than 1
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0
- `i` is `n`
- `dp` is `arr[n] - arr[n + 1] > 1 or not True`

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive). The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented to `n-1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Variable `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` at the start of each iteration, we need to set `i` to `n-1` for the loop to execute one more time.
- **Other Variables**: The other variables (`tc`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `dp`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

### Updated State:
- `tc` remains an input integer where 0 < tc ≤ 10^4 - 2
- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` remains greater than 1
- `arr` remains a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0
- `i` is now `n-1`
- `dp` remains `arr[n] - arr[n + 1] > 1 or not True`

### Final State:
State: **`tc` is an input integer where 0 < tc ≤ 10^4 - 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `n-1`, `dp` is `arr[n] - arr[n + 1] > 1 or not True`**
