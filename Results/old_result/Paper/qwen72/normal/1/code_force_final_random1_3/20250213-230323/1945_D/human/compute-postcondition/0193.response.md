Output State: **`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is `max_p - 2`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` must be greater than or equal to 2, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 2] + a_values[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `custo += a_values[0]` increments the value of `custo` by the value of `a_values[0]`.
- The initial state specifies that `custo` was already increased by `b_values[max_p - 2]`.
- Therefore, after executing the code, `custo` is now increased by both `b_values[max_p - 2]` and `a_values[0]`.
- All other variables (`b`, `y`, `b_values`, `num_fila`, `max_p`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
