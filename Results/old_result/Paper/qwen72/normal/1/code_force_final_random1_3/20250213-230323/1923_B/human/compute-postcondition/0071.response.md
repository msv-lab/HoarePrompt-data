Output State: **`rest` is `k - 2*delta`, `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is `-delta`, `distance` is `distance + 1`, `delta` is the minimum of `k - delta` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is 0. All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) retain their initial values.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is updated from 0 to `-delta`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
