t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the size of the grid. Each grid is represented by a list of n strings, each string containing n characters ('0' or '1'). The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'.
