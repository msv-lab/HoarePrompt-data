The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an integer greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 3), and `n` must still be greater than `i` (so `n` must be greater than 3).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to 1000, the second element set to 1000 + x[0], and the third element set to 1000 + x[0] + x[1], `i` is 3**
