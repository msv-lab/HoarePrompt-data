Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from the previous value), `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be non-zero, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `L` is an empty list, `a` is undefined, `tot` is undefined, `pow` is undefined, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
