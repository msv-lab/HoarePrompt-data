The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, and `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` should be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string containing the input with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr[::-1]` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.**
