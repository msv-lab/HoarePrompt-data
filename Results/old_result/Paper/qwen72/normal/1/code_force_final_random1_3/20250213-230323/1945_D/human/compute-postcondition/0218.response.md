Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but reads from predefined inputs (likely global variables or input streams) that include multiple test cases. Each test case consists of integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. The function processes each test case to determine the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position not exceeding `m` by bribing people in the queue, where the costs are defined by the lists `a` and `b`. The function returns the minimum cost for each test case.**
