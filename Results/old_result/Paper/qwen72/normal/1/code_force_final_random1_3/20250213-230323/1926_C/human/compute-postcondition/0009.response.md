The value of `num` is updated to the integer division of the original `num` by 10, which effectively removes the last digit of `num`. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is based on the original `num` and its digits before the division. Since `num` was originally an integer such that 0 < num <= 2000, after the division, `num` will be an integer such that 0 <= num < 200 (since the last digit is removed).

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 0 <= num < 200, `a` is the last digit of the original `num` plus the last digit of the original `num` before the division plus the last digit of the original `num`.**
