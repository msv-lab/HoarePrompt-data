Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `None` except for the last element which is `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `mex` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[len(ar) - 1] - ar[i]` and `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]`.**
