The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and `n_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n_cases`. For the loop to execute, `n_cases` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0, as this is the starting point for the loop's iteration.

State: **`i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0**
