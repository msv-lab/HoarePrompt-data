Output State: **After the loop has completed all iterations, the variable `idx` will be `3 + n + 2 * q + n + 1 + 2 * q + 2 + n + 2 * q`, `results` will contain 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, followed by two empty strings at the end, and `i` will be `n`. The variables `t`, `data`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, and `mp` will remain unchanged.**
