The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the value `m`. For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 1 (since the loop runs from 0 to `m-2`). The other variables and conditions mentioned in the state before the loop do not affect the loop's ability to execute directly, as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `m` is greater than 1 and `j` is initialized to 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is `True`, `j` is 0, the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`)**
