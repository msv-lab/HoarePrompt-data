Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 4.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `k` is 1 if `res` (before the input) is not `<`, otherwise `k` is 3.
   - `best` is the last index `i` for which `res` was `<`, if no such `i` exists, `best` remains 0.
   - `res` is the new input string. If `res` is `<`, `k` is updated to 3.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The first argument to `print` is the string `'?'`.
   - The second argument is `0`.
   - The third argument is `k`.
   - The fourth argument is `0`.
   - The fifth argument is `i`.

4. **Evaluate `k`:**
   - `k` is determined based on the value of `res` before the input.
   - If `res` (before the input) is not `<`, then `k` is 1.
   - If `res` (before the input) is `<`, then `k` is 3.
   - After the input, if `res` is `<`, `k` is updated to 3.

5. **Evaluate `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 4.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'`, followed by `0`, the value of `k`, `0`, and `4`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the value of `k` can be either 1 or 3 depending on the value of `res` before the input. Therefore, the output will be one of the following:

- If `res` (before the input) is not `<`, then `k` is 1.
- If `res` (before the input) is `<`, then `k` is 3.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 1 0 4** (if `res` before the input is not `<`)
or
Output: **? 0 3 0 4** (if `res` before the input is `<`)
