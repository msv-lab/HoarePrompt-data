Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` containing the cumulative products of the elements of `arr` in reverse order, starting from the last element to the first.** 

This means that if `arr` was initially `[a, b, c, d]`, then `ans` would contain the values `[a*b*c*d, b*c*d, c*d, d]`. Each element in `ans` represents the product of all elements in `arr` from that position to the end of the list.
