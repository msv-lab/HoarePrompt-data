### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to find a permutation `p` of length `n` such that the Manhattan value of `p` equals `k`.
   - The Manhattan value is defined as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).
   - If no such permutation exists, we should output "No".

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_4**: This function reads the input values `n` and `k`, checks if `k` is even (since the Manhattan value must be even), and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. If `k` exceeds this maximum, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation exists.
     - **Correctness**: This function is correct. It correctly checks the parity of `k` and the maximum possible Manhattan value.
   - **func_1**: This function attempts to construct a permutation that achieves the required Manhattan value `k`. It uses a series of swaps to adjust the permutation.
     - **Correctness**: The logic in `func_1` is complex and involves a loop that iterates over a range of values, performing swaps based on the value of `k`. The function divides `k` by 2 and uses a loop to reduce `k` by the sum of a series of odd numbers. It also calls `func_2` and `func_3` to perform specific swaps.
     - **Potential Issues**: The condition `if k < i - 1:` might not always lead to the correct permutation. The loop and swap conditions might not cover all edge cases, especially for large values of `n` and `k`.
   - **func_2** and **func_3**: These functions perform specific swaps in the permutation list `l` to adjust the Manhattan value.
     - **Correctness**: These functions are correct in their implementation. They swap elements in the list as specified.
   - **func_6**: This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4` to validate the input, then `func_1` to generate the permutation, and finally `func_5` to print the result.
     - **Correctness**: This function is correct in its overall flow and output handling.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **func_4** is correct and ensures that `k` is even and within the possible range for the given `n`.
   - **func_1** is the most complex part of the program and has potential issues. The logic for constructing the permutation might not always produce the correct result, especially for edge cases or large values of `n` and `k`.
   - **func_2** and **func_3** are correct and perform the necessary swaps.
   - **func_6** is correct in its overall flow and output handling.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity and potential issues in the permutation construction logic in `func_1`, the program might not always produce the correct permutation for all valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is not guaranteed.

Final: **False**
