The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It first reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) and generates a string `word` based on the value of `n`:
- If `n` > 52, `word` is the character at position `n - 53` in the lowercase English alphabet followed by `'zz'`.
- If `n` > 26 and `n` ≤ 52, `word` is `'a'` followed by the character at position `n - 28` in the alphabet and then `'z'`.
- If `n` ≤ 26, `word` is `'aa'` followed by the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet.
After processing each test case, the generated `word` is printed on a new line. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
