Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `results` will contain `t` elements, each corresponding to the final value of `current_year` for each test case in `test_cases`. For each test case, `current_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the sum of the multiples of each element in `a` that were added to the initial `current_year` (which was 0). The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, and `results` contains the final `current_year` for each test case.**
