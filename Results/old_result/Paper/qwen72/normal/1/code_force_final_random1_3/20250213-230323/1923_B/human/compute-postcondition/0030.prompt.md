Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second, `n` is the length of the list `a` (and also the length of the list `x`), `sorted_indices` is a list of indices from 0 to `n-1` sorted based on the absolute values of the elements in `x`, `distance` is 0, `pos` is 0, the absolute value of the element at the index `sorted_indices[pos]` in `x` is not equal to `distance`, `rest` is `k`.
Code of the loop:
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
    delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
    rest -= delta
    a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
    if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
        pos += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is updated such that the health of the monster at the position `sorted_indices[pos]` is reduced by `delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` becomes 0, the health of the monster at the position `sorted_indices[pos-1]` is reduced by `delta` and is now 0, and `pos` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, `distance`, `rest`, and `delta`) retain their previous values.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is reduced by `delta`, `rest` is now `rest - delta`, and `pos` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`, and `rest` is now `rest - delta`. All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, `distance`) retain their previous values, and `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. `rest` is now `rest - delta`. `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` becomes 0, then `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, `rest` is now `rest - delta`, `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is now `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]] - delta`, and `pos` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, `distance`) retain their previous values.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
