Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The list `new` will have the maximum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`, and the value at index `i` (where `a[i] != b[i]`) is now `max(a[i], b[i])`. The list `new2` will have the minimum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`. The variable `i` is equal to the first index where `a[i] != b[i]`, and `i` is not equal to the length of `a`.**
