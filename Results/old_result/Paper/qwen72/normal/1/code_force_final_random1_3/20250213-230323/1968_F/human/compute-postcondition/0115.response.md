Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is `3 + n + 2 * q + n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[i]` is set to `int(data[3 + n + 2 * q + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to index `i`, `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value from `pf` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where that prefix XOR value occurs, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and an additional empty string at the end, and `i` is `n`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The list `data` remains unchanged.
- The variable `idx` has been incremented by `n + 1` from its initial value.
- The list `a` now contains `n` integers, each set to the corresponding value from `data`.
- The list `pf` contains the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to each index.
- The dictionary `mp` maps each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where it occurs.
- The list `results` remains unchanged except for the additional empty string at the end.
- The loop counter `i` is equal to `n`.
