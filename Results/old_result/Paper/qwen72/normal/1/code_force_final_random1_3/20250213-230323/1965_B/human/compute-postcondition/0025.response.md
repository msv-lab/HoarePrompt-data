Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with new values assigned by `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `l` is the length of the binary string `b`. `k` is not equal to 1. `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 up to 2^(lk-2). `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk` and must be at least 2, `i` is lk-2.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `lk - 1` times, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.
- Each iteration appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`, starting from `i = 0`.
- After all iterations, `ans` will contain the values `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2)]`.
- The variable `i` will be `lk - 2` after the last iteration.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `lk`) remain unchanged.
