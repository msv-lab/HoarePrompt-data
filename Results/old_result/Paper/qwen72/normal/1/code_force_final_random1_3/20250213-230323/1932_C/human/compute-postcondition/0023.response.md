Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list that is constructed based on the value of `s[0]` and now includes either `a[l]` or `a[r]` appended to it depending on whether `s[i]` is 'L' or 'R'. If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` includes `a[l]` and `l` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is 'R', `b` includes `a[r]` and `r` is decremented by 1. `l` is 2 if `s[0]` is 'L' or 1 if `s[0]` is 'R', `r` is `n - 1` if `s[0]` is 'L' or `n - 2` if `s[0]` is 'R', `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.**
