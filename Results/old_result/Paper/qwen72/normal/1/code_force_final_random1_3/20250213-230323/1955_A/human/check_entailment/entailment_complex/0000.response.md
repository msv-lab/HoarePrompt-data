Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` (renamed to `A`, `B`, and `C` in the function).

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost**:
   - **Case 1**: If the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is less than the promotional price (`C`), then it's cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price. The function correctly prints `A * B`.
   - **Case 2**: If the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is greater than or equal to the promotional price (`C`), and `A` is even, then it's cheaper to buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price. The function correctly prints `int(A * C / 2)`.
   - **Case 3**: If the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is greater than or equal to the promotional price (`C`), and `A` is odd, then it's cheaper to buy as many pairs as possible at the promotional price and the remaining one at the regular price. The function correctly calculates and prints `X * C + B`, where `X` is `A // 2`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `A` is 1 correctly by falling into the third case, where it buys one yogurt at the regular price.
   - The function also handles the case where `A` is even and the promotional price is cheaper, ensuring that the total cost is minimized.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the correct minimum cost for each test case, as required by the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to handle all the specified conditions and edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
