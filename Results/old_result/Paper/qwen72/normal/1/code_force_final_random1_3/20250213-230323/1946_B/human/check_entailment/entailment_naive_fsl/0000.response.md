Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the calculation of the maximum possible sum after k operations. Specifically, the formula `sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm` is incorrect. This formula attempts to calculate the effect of performing k operations, but it does not correctly account for the exponential growth of the sum due to repeated insertions of the maximum subarray sum.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 3
2 2 8
```
The expected output is `96`, as explained in the problem description. However, the program will output a different result due to the incorrect formula used to calculate the final sum.

### Explanation of the Error:
The correct approach to calculate the maximum possible sum after k operations involves recognizing that the maximum subarray sum can be added to the array up to \(2^k\) times. The correct formula should be:
\[ \text{max\_sum} = (\text{max\_subarray\_sum} \times (2^k - 1)) + \text{initial\_sum} \]

However, the program uses:
\[ \text{sm} = 2^k \times \text{sm} - \text{sm} \]
which simplifies to:
\[ \text{sm} = (2^k - 1) \times \text{sm} \]

This formula is close but does not correctly handle the initial sum of the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
