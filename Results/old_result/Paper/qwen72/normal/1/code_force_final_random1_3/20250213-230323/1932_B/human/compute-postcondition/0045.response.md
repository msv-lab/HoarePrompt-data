The only object in the loop head is the variable `test` and the list `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `test_cases` list. If there are more elements in `test_cases`, the loop will execute again with the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `current_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the sum of the multiples of each element in `a` that were added to the initial `current_year` (which was 0). The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `test`, `results`, and `n` remain unchanged, except that `results` now includes `current_year` as its last element.

For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, and `test` will be the next element in `test_cases`.

State: **`current_year` will be the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the sum of the multiples of each element in `a` that were added to the initial `current_year` (which was 0), `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `results` now includes `current_year` as its last element, `t`, `test_cases`, `test`, `results`, and `n` remain unchanged except for the changes mentioned above.**
