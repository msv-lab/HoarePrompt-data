Output State: **`feat` is updated to a list of integers input by the user, `i` is no longer `n`, `n` is the first element of the new `feat` list, `f` is the second element of the new `feat` list, `a` is the third element of the new `feat` list, `b` is the last element of the new `feat` list, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `array2` contains elements based on the conditions specified in the loop, and `n` must be less than `test_cases`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]` updates the `arr` variable to a list of integers input by the user.
- The initial state mentions that `feat` is updated to a list of integers input by the user, and this remains unchanged.
- The variables `i`, `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are derived from the elements of the `feat` list, and their values remain as described in the initial state.
- The condition that `n` must be less than `test_cases` remains valid.
- The `array2` variable is mentioned to contain elements based on conditions specified in a loop, which is not affected by the given code snippet.
