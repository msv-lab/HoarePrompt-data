Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the input efficiently using `sys.stdin.read` and processes each test case individually. The prefix XOR array (`pf`) is used to quickly calculate the XOR of any subarray, which is a common and efficient technique for this type of problem. The dictionary `mp` maps each unique XOR value to the indices where it occurs, allowing the program to check if a subarray can be split into parts with the same XOR value.

The key steps in the program are:
1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The prefix XOR array `pf` is calculated such that `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
2. **Mapping XOR Values to Indices**: The dictionary `mp` maps each XOR value to the list of indices where it occurs.
3. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` using the prefix XOR array. If the XOR is zero, the subarray is interesting. Otherwise, it checks if there exist indices within the subarray that have the same XOR values, indicating that the subarray can be split into parts with the same XOR.

The program also handles the input and output format correctly, ensuring that the results are printed in the required format.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
