Output State: **`ops` contains the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, `(c2, 5)`, ..., `(c1, len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`, `(c2, len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `i` is the last valid index in the loop, `n` is the last non-negative value in the `previous` list that leads back to node 0, `u2vs` is a list of lists with length equal to the original `n`, each sublist contains the indices of the nodes connected to the node corresponding to the sublist's index, `d` holds the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes, `previous` holds the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` followed by the sequence of node indices leading back to node 0, including the final value of `n`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range starting from 1 to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of 2. This means that the loop will run as long as `i` is less than `len(path_ba) - c1`.
- For each iteration, two tuples are appended to the `ops` list: `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`.
- The final state of `ops` will contain all the tuples generated during the loop execution.
- The values of `c1` and `c2` remain constant throughout the loop, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
- The value of `i` will be the last valid index in the loop, which is `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, `b`, `path_ba`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
