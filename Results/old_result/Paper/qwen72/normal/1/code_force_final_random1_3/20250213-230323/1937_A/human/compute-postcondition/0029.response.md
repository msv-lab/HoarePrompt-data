Output State: **`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the input integer and must be greater than 1, `power` is 2.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `power` by 1. Initially, `power` was 1, so after the increment, `power` is now 2. The values of `i`, `n_cases`, and `n` remain unchanged.
