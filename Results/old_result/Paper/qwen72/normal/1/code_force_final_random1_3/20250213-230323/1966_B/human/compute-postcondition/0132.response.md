Let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial Variables:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `tc` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `ans` is 'YES'.
   - `impossible` is `False`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then:
     - `n` is greater than 1.
     - `m` is greater than 1.
     - `i` is `n - 2`.
     - `j` is `m - 2`.
     - `ans` is 'NO'.
     - For all `j` from 0 to `m - 2`, `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`.
     - If any `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]` for `i` from 0 to `n - 2`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` is `True`.

3. **Final Condition:**
   - If `impossible` is `True`, the program does not change any variables.

Given these conditions, let's determine the value of `ans`:

- Initially, `ans` is set to 'YES'.
- The condition `if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]` checks if the top-left corner of the grid is different from the bottom-right corner.
  - If this condition is true, `ans` is set to 'NO'.
  - Additionally, other conditions are checked to ensure the consistency of the grid, but they do not affect the value of `ans` directly unless `impossible` is set to `True`.

- If `impossible` is `True`, no changes are made to any variables, including `ans`.

Therefore, the value of `ans` will be:
- 'NO' if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`.
- 'YES' otherwise.

Since the exact values of `gr`, `n`, and `m` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the conditions given.

Output: **ans (where ans is 'YES' if gr[0][0] == gr[n - 1][m - 1], and 'NO' otherwise)**
