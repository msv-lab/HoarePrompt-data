The code snippet `p.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`.

- Initially, `p` is `[0, i, i]`.
- After appending `i`, `p` becomes `[0, i, i, i]`.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `i` is the sum of the first three elements of `l`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `l` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `p` is `[0, i, i, i]`, `c` is `[0, j, j]`, `x` is the third element of `l`. If `x` is 1, then `j` is 3. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
