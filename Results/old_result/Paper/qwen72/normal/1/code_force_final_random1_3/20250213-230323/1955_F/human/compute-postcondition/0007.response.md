The code snippet `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then maps each integer to its nearest even number (by subtracting the remainder when divided by 2). This new list of nearest even numbers is then assigned to `p`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `p` is a list of the nearest even numbers derived from the input integers
- The loop has run once
- There are `int(input()) - 2` iterations left

After executing the code snippet, the list `p` is updated to contain the nearest even numbers derived from the new input integers. The number of remaining iterations is reduced by 1 because the loop has run one more time.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p` is a list of the nearest even numbers derived from the new input integers, the loop has run twice, and there are `int(input()) - 3` iterations left.**
