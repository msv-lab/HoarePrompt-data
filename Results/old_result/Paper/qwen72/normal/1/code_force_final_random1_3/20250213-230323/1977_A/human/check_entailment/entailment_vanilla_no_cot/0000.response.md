Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem. It checks various conditions to determine if it's possible to end up with a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves:

1. If `n` equals `m`, it's possible to add a cube in each move, so the answer is "Yes".
2. If `m` is greater than `n`, it's impossible to have more cubes in the tower than the number of moves, so the answer is "No".
3. If `m` is exactly one less than `n`, it's possible to achieve this by adding a cube in all but one move, where one cube is removed, so the answer is "Yes".
4. If both `m` and `n` are even, it's possible to achieve the desired number of cubes, so the answer is "Yes".
5. If both `m` and `n` are odd, it's also possible to achieve the desired number of cubes, so the answer is "Yes".
6. In all other cases, it's not possible to achieve the desired number of cubes, so the answer is "No".

These conditions cover all the necessary scenarios to determine the possibility of achieving a tower of `m` cubes after `n` moves, making the program correct.
