Let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers from the input.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 2.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `B * 2` is less than `C`, no further changes are made.
   - If `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`:
     - If `A` is even, no further changes are made.
     - If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code prints `A * B`.

### Analysis:
- **Step 1:** Check the condition `B * 2 < C`.
  - If true, no further changes are made, and the code will print `A * B`.
  - If false, proceed to the next condition.

- **Step 2:** Check the condition `B * 2 >= C`.
  - If true, check if `A` is even.
    - If `A` is even, no further changes are made, and the code will print `A * B`.
    - If `A` is odd, set `X` to `A // 2`, but this does not affect the value of `A * B`.

### Conclusion:
- Regardless of the conditions, the value of `A * B` remains unchanged and will be printed.

### Final Output:
Output: **A * B (where A and B are the input integers)**
