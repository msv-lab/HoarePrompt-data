Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input, `ad` is a list containing `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`, `bd` is a list containing only the integer 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- The placeholders and input variables (`_`, `n`, `k`, `q`) remain unchanged.
- The list `a` starts with 0 and contains the integers read from the input, and it must have at least as many elements as its length.
- The list `b` also starts with 0 and contains the integers read from the input, but it remains unchanged.
- The list `ad` now contains the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, starting with 0.
- The list `bd` still contains only the integer 0.
- The loop index `i` reaches `len(a) - 1` after all iterations.
