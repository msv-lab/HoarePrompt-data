Output State: **`tc` is an input integer where 0 < tc ≤ 10^4 - 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `n-1`, `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not (arr[n] - arr[n + 1] > 1 or not True)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `dp` is updated to `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`.
- Given `i` is `n-1`, the expression `arr[i] - arr[i + 1]` becomes `arr[n-1] - arr[n]`.
- The new value of `dp` is therefore `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not (arr[n] - arr[n + 1] > 1 or not True)`.
- All other variables (`tc`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `i`) remain unchanged.
