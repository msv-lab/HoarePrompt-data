Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `ad` is a list containing `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`, `bd` is a list containing `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b)-1] - b[len(b)-2]]`, `i` is `len(b) + len(a) - 2`, `len(a) <= len(b)`, `v` is `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
    print(int(m), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `i`, `v`, `s`) retain their original values. If `a[s] == ql`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`. `m` is increased by `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `l` (incremented by 1), `m` (now `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`), `i` (now 1), `s` (index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order), `ql` (decremented by `a[s - 1]`). If `a[s] == ql`, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. `q` must be greater than the new value of `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `l` (now `l + 1`), `m` (now `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`), `i` (now 1), `s` (index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order), `ql` (decremented by `a[s - 1]`), `ql` is now an input integer. If `a[s] == ql`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
