The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', then `idx_A` is a list containing [0]. If `len(idx_A) == 0`, then `A` is a list containing [0]. Otherwise, `A` is a list containing one element `[x]`, where `x` is calculated as `(0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not '>', then `A` and `idx_A` remain empty lists.**
