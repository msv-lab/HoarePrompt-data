Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and q where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of elements in the array and the number of queries, respectively. The array a contains n integers a_1, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30. Each query is represented by two integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases and the sum of q over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5. `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input. `idx` is 0.**
