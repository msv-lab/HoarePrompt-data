To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24
- `j` is 3
- `nx` is determined based on the conditions provided:
  - If the character at position `[1][1]` in the array `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is the character at position `[1][1]` in the array `xx` concatenated with itself.
  - If the character at position `[1][1]` in the array `xx` is '?', then `nx` is 'F' if either `i` (1) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `j` (3) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.
  - Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
nx += xx[i][j - 1]
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `nx` before the code execution:**
   - If `xx[1][1]` is not '?', then `nx` is `xx[1][1] + xx[1][1]`.
   - If `xx[1][1]` is '?', then:
     - If `i` (1) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `j` (3) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, then `nx` is 'F'.
     - Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.

2. **Execute the code snippet:**
   - The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at position `[i][j - 1]` in the array `xx` to the string `nx`.
   - Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, the position `[i][j - 1]` is `[1][2]`.

3. **Update the value of `nx`:**
   - If `xx[1][1]` is not '?', then `nx` was initially `xx[1][1] + xx[1][1]`, and now it becomes `xx[1][1] + xx[1][1] + xx[1][2]`.
   - If `xx[1][1]` is '?', then:
     - If `i` (1) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `j` (3) is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, then `nx` was initially 'F', and now it becomes 'F' + `xx[1][2]`.
     - Otherwise, `nx` was initially 'S', and now it becomes 'S' + `xx[1][2]`.

### Output State:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24
- `j` is 3
- `nx` is updated based on the initial value of `nx` and the character at position `[1][2]` in the array `xx`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` is 3, `nx` is updated to include the character at position `[1][2]` in the array `xx` appended to its initial value.**
