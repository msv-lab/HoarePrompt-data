Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `j` starts at 1 and increments up to `n`, the character at position `j-1` in the list `x` is 'S', and the value at index `j` in the list `b` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value at index `j` in the list `b` is incremented by 1. All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
