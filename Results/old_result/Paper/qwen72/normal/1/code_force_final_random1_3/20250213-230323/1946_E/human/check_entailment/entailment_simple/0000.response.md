Reasoning:

1. **Factorial Precomputation**: The program starts by precomputing factorials up to 200,000 and storing them in the list `facts`. This is necessary for later calculations involving combinations and permutations, which are essential for counting the number of valid permutations.

2. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`. It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

3. **Initial Validity Check**: The program checks if the last prefix maximum index is the same as the first suffix maximum index, the first prefix maximum index is 1, and the last suffix maximum index is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, the program prints 0, indicating that no valid permutation exists.

4. **Combination Calculation**: The program uses the `func_2` function to calculate combinations. The `func_2` function, in turn, uses the `func_1` function to compute the modular multiplicative inverse, which is necessary for calculating combinations under modulo 10^9 + 7.

5. **Permutation Counting**:
   - The program iterates over the suffix maximums and calculates the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements.
   - It then iterates over the prefix maximums in reverse order and performs similar calculations.
   - Finally, it multiplies the results by the factorials of the gaps between consecutive prefix and suffix maximums.

6. **Modulo Operations**: All intermediate results and final answers are taken modulo 10^9 + 7 to ensure they fit within the required constraints.

7. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, which are used to find the modular multiplicative inverse.
   - The function handles base cases and recursive calls correctly, ensuring that the GCD and coefficients are computed accurately.

8. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses the results from `func_1` to compute the modular multiplicative inverse and then multiplies it by the given value `a` to get the final result modulo 10^9 + 7.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The use of modular arithmetic, precomputed factorials, and the combination of prefix and suffix maximums is appropriate for the problem's constraints and requirements.
