The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`i` is 200000, `pd[200000]` contains the cumulative sum of all previous elements in `pd` plus the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to 199999, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `t` is now `t - 1`**
