Postcondition: ***`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` depending on the condition. `rest` is updated to `rest - delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, `rest` is `rest - delta`, `pos` is incremented by 1, and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is updated to `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]] - delta`. Otherwise, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is updated to `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`. `distance` remains unchanged, and `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` retain their initial values.***
