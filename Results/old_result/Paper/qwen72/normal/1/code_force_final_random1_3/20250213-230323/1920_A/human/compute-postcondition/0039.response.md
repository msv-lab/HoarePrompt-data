Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` is the number of iterations completed, `i` is `n-1`, `start` is the maximum value encountered when `t` was 1, `end` is the minimum value encountered when `t` was 2, and `num` is a list containing all values of `v` encountered when `t` was 3. The initial values of `start` (-1) and `end` (1000000000.0) are updated only if conditions within the loop are met.**

Explanation:
- `n` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed.
- `i` is the index of the last iteration, which is `n-1`.
- `start` is updated to the highest value of `v` encountered when `t` was 1, but only if `v` is greater than the current `start`.
- `end` is updated to the lowest value of `v` encountered when `t` was 2, but only if `v` is less than the current `end`.
- `num` is a list that contains all the values of `v` encountered when `t` was 3.
