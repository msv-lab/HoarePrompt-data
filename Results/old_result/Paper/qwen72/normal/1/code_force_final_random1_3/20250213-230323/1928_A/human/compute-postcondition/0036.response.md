Postcondition: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is a throwaway variable, `a` and `b` are integers from the input. If `a` is even, `a1` is set to `a // 2` and `a2` is set to `a // 2`. If `b` is even, `b1` is set to `b // 2` and `b2` is set to `b // 2`. If `a1` is not equal to `b`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `b1` is not equal to `a`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program does not change `a`, `b`, or `t`, and continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
