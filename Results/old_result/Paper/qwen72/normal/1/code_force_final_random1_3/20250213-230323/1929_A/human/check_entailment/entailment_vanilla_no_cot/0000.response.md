Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as specified. The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. However, the program simply sorts the array and prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements. This approach does not account for the sum of the differences between all consecutive elements, which is required to calculate the maximum beauty.

To correctly solve the problem, one should sort the array and then compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This is because sorting the array maximizes the positive differences and minimizes the negative differences, leading to the maximum possible beauty.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        beauty = sum(a[i] - a[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)
```

This version correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
