Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `num` is a list. If `t` is 3, `num` contains `v`. If `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, `end` is updated to `v`. If `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`, `start` remains unchanged. `t` and `v` are integers provided by user input. If `t` is 2, `end` is updated to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`. Otherwise, `start` remains unchanged.***
