Correctness: **True**

The provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic needed to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and constraints. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
2. **Unique Pile Sizes**: It uses `set` to filter out duplicate pile sizes and sorts them in descending order. This step is crucial because the game dynamics depend on the unique sizes of the piles.
3. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The program uses a boolean variable `dp` to track the winning state. The loop iterates through the sorted unique pile sizes and updates `dp` based on the difference between consecutive pile sizes.
   - If the difference between two consecutive pile sizes is greater than 1, it means the current player can force a win by making a move that leaves the opponent in a losing position.
   - The `or not dp` part ensures that the winning state alternates correctly based on the previous state.
4. **Output**: The program prints "Alice" if `dp` is `True` and "Bob" otherwise, which correctly reflects the winner based on the optimal play.

This approach effectively captures the essence of the game and the conditions under which Alice or Bob would win, making the solution correct.
