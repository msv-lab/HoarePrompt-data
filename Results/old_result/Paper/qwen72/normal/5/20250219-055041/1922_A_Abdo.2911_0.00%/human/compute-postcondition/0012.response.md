Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 0. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, `template` is a list containing the first character of `a`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of the first character of `a`.***
