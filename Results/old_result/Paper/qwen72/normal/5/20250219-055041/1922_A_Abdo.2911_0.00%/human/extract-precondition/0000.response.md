Precondition: **The function `func_1` should actually be defined with parameters `n, a, b, c` where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n, a, b, c` as described above.
