Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n`, `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) for all `n` characters in `a`, `match_a_b` is `True` or `False` depending on the conditions described, and if `c[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, then `match_c` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
