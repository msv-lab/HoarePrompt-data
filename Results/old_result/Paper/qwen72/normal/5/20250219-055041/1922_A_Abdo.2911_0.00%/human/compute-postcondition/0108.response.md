Output State: **`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is `n-1`, `template` is a list of length `n`. Each element in `template` is the corresponding character from `a` if the character at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a`. `match_a_b` is `True`.**

The variable `match_a_b` is set to `True`, and all other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
