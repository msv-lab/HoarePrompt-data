Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a logical flaw in how it constructs the template and checks for matches. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Template Construction**:
   - The template is constructed by iterating over the characters of `a` and `b`. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, it appends `a[i]` to the template. Otherwise, it appends the uppercase version of `a[i]`.
   - This approach is incorrect because it doesn't consider the possibility that `a[i]` and `b[i]` might be different but still match a template. For example, if `a[i] = 'a'` and `b[i] = 'b'`, the template could be `'C'` (or any other uppercase letter), but the program incorrectly sets it to `'A'`.

2. **Matching Checks**:
   - The program checks if `a` and `b` match the template by ensuring that for each lowercase character in the template, the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are the same. For uppercase characters, it checks if the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are different from the lowercase version of the template.
   - However, the program incorrectly sets the template to the uppercase version of `a[i]` when `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, which can lead to incorrect matches.

3. **Checking `c`**:
   - The program checks if `c` matches the template by ensuring that for each lowercase character in the template, the corresponding character in `c` is the same. For uppercase characters, it checks if the corresponding character in `c` is different from the lowercase version of the template.
   - This is also incorrect because it should ensure that `c` does not match the template, which means for lowercase characters in the template, `c[i]` should be different, and for uppercase characters, `c[i]` should be the same.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, you need to:

1. **Construct the Template**:
   - For each position `i`, if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, the template must be `a[i]` (lowercase).
   - If `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, the template must be an uppercase letter that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

2. **Check if `a` and `b` Match the Template**:
   - For each position `i`, if the template is lowercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must equal the template.
   - If the template is uppercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of the template.

3. **Check if `c` Does Not Match the Template**:
   - For each position `i`, if the template is lowercase, `c[i]` must be different from the template.
   - If the template is uppercase, `c[i]` must be the same as the lowercase version of the template.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                # Choose an uppercase letter that is different from both a[i] and b[i]
                for char in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ':
                    if char.lower() != a[i] and char.lower() != b[i]:
                        template.append(char)
                        break
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i] == template[i].lower() or b[i] == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        match_c = False
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] == template[i]:
                    match_c = True
                    break
            elif c[i] == template[i].lower():
                match_c = True
                break
        if match_a_b and not match_c:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func_1()
```

This corrected program should correctly determine if there exists a template such that `a` and `b` match it, while `c` does not.
