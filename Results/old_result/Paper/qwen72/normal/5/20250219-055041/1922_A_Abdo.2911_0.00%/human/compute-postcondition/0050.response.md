Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 2, `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) for all `n` characters in `a`. If `template[i]` is a lowercase letter and `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_a_b` is `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter and `a[i]` or `b[i]` (or both) match `template[i]` in a case-insensitive manner, `match_a_b` is `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`.***
