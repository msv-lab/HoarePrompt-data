Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n-1`, `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) for all `n` characters in `a`, `match_a_b` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
            match_a_b = False
            break
    elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
        ].lower():
        match_a_b = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 0, `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) for all `n` characters in `a`. If the character at index `i` in `template` is a lowercase letter and `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_a_b` is `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `i` in `template` is not a lowercase letter and the character at index `i` in `a` or `b` (or both) is the same as the character at index `i` in `template` when compared in a case-insensitive manner, `match_a_b` is `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 1, `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) for all `n` characters in `a`. If `template[i]` is a lowercase letter and `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_a_b` is `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter and the character at index `i` in `a` or `b` (or both) is the same as the character at index `i` in `template` when compared in a case-insensitive manner, `match_a_b` is `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 2, `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) for all `n` characters in `a`. If `template[i]` is a lowercase letter and `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_a_b` is `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter and `a[i]` or `b[i]` (or both) match `template[i]` in a case-insensitive manner, `match_a_b` is `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
