Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n + 1`, `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) for all `n` characters in `a`, `match_c` is `False`, and `match_a_b` retains its original value, which could be `True` or `False`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
