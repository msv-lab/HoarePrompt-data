Postcondition: ***`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is 1, `template` is a list of length `n`. Each element in `template` is the corresponding character from `a` if the character at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_c` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_c` retains its previous value.***
