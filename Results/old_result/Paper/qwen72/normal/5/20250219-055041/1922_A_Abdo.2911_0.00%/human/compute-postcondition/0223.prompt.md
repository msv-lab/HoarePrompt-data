Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is the corresponding element from `a` if it matches the corresponding element in `b`, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding element from `a`, and `match_a_b` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
            match_a_b = False
            break
    elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
        ].lower():
        match_a_b = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is the corresponding element from `a` if it matches the corresponding element in `b`, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding element from `a`. If `template[0]` is a lowercase letter and `a[0]` is not equal to `template[0]` or `b[0]` is not equal to `template[0]`, `match_a_b` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `template[0]` is not a lowercase letter, `match_a_b` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is the corresponding element from `a` if it matches the corresponding element in `b`, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding element from `a`. If `template[i]` is a lowercase letter and `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_a_b` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter and `a[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` matches `template[i].lower()`, `match_a_b` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `template[0]` is a lowercase letter and `a[0]` is not equal to `template[0]` or `b[0]` is not equal to `template[0]`, `match_a_b` is `False`. If `template[0]` is not a lowercase letter, `match_a_b` is `False`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is the corresponding element from `a` if it matches the corresponding element in `b`, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding element from `a`. If `template[i]` is a lowercase letter and either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_a_b` is `False` and the program has exited the most immediate loop or conditional block. If `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter and either `a[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` matches `template[i].lower()`, `match_a_b` is `False` and the program has exited the most immediate loop or conditional block. If `template[0]` is a lowercase letter and either `a[0]` is not equal to `template[0]` or `b[0]` is not equal to `template[0]`, `match_a_b` is `False`. If `template[0]` is not a lowercase letter, `match_a_b` is `False`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
