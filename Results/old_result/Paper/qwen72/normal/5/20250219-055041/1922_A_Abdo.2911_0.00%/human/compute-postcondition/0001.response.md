The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` does not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
