Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 1. `template` is a list containing the first character of `a` (or the uppercase version of the first character of `a` if the first characters of `a` and `b` are not equal). If the second characters of `a` and `b` are equal, `template` also contains the second character of `a`. Otherwise, `template` contains the uppercase version of the second character of `a`.***
