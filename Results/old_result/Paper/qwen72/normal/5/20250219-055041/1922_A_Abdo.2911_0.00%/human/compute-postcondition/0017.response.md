The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 2. `template` is a list containing the first character of `a` (or the uppercase version of the first character of `a` if the first characters of `a` and `b` are not equal). If the second characters of `a` and `b` are equal, `template` also contains the second character of `a`. Otherwise, `template` contains the uppercase version of the second character of `a`.**
