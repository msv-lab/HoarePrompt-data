Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be an integer greater than 0, `num` is `n-1`, `final` is a list containing the sums of all elements at even indices in each of the `n` sorted lists `list2` generated during the loop, `s` is the sum of all elements at even indices in the last `list2`, `list1` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the last user input `b` by spaces, `i` is the last even index in the last `list2` (or `len(list2) - 1` if the length of the last `list2` is odd), `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all the strings in the last `list1`, `a` is the user input, `b` is the last user input.
Code of the loop:
for fin in final:
    print(fin)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be an integer greater than 0, `num` is `n-1`, `final` is a list containing the sums of all elements at even indices in each of the `n` sorted lists `list2` generated during the loop, `s` is the sum of all elements at even indices in the last `list2`, `list1` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the last user input `b` by spaces, `i` is the last even index in the last `list2` (or `len(list2) - 1` if the length of the last `list2` is odd), `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all the strings in the last `list1`, `a` is the user input, `b` is the last user input, `final` must contain at least one element

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be an integer greater than 0, `num` is `n-1`, `final` is a list containing the sums of all elements at even indices in each of the `n` sorted lists `list2` generated during the loop and must contain at least two elements, `s` is the sum of all elements at even indices in the last `list2`, `list1` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the last user input `b` by spaces, `i` is the last even index in the last `list2` (or `len(list2) - 1` if the length of the last `list2` is odd), `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all the strings in the last `list1`, `a` is the user input, `b` is the last user input, `fin` is the second element in `final`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be an integer greater than 0, `num` is `n-1`, `final` is a list containing the sums of all elements at even indices in each of the `n` sorted lists `list2` generated during the loop and must contain at least three elements, `s` is the sum of all elements at even indices in the last `list2`, `list1` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the last user input `b` by spaces, `i` is the last even index in the last `list2` (or `len(list2) - 1` if the length of the last `list2` is odd), `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all the strings in the last `list1`, `a` is the user input, `b` is the last user input, `fin` is the third element in `final`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
