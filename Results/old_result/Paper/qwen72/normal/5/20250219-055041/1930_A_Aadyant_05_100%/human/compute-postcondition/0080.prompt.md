You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) with each integer a_i in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        
        list2 = []
        
        a = input()
        
        list1 = []
        
        b = input()
        
        list1 = b.split()
        
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        
        list2.sort()
        
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        
        final.append(s)
        
    #State: `n` must be an integer greater than 0, `num` is `n-1`, `final` is a list containing the sums of all elements at even indices in each of the `n` sorted lists `list2` generated during the loop, `s` is the sum of all elements at even indices in the last `list2`, `list1` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the last user input `b` by spaces, `i` is the last even index in the last `list2` (or `len(list2) - 1` if the length of the last `list2` is odd), `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all the strings in the last `list1`, `a` is the user input, `b` is the last user input.
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
        
    #State: `n` must be an integer greater than 0, `num` is `n-1`, `final` is a list containing the sums of all elements at even indices in each of the `n` sorted lists `list2` generated during the loop, `s` is the sum of all elements at even indices in the last `list2`, `list1` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the last user input `b` by spaces, `i` is the last even index in the last `list2` (or `len(list2) - 1` if the length of the last `list2` is odd), `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all the strings in the last `list1`, `a` is the user input, `b` is the last user input, `fin` is the last element in `final`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists where each inner list contains 2n integers. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
