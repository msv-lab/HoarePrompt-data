Output State: **`n` must be an integer greater than 0, `num` is 0, `final` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer values of all words in `list1`, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string, `list1` is a list of words from `b` split by whitespace, `str` is the last word in `list1`**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- `n`: Remains an integer greater than 0, as it is not modified by the loop.
- `num`: Remains 0, as it is not modified by the loop.
- `final`: Remains an empty list, as it is not modified by the loop.
- `s`: Remains 0, as it is not modified by the loop.
- `list2`: Contains the integer values of all the words in `list1`. Each word in `list1` is converted to an integer and appended to `list2`.
- `a`: Remains the input string, as it is not modified by the loop.
- `b`: Remains the input string, as it is not modified by the loop.
- `list1`: Remains a list of words from `b` split by whitespace, as it is not modified by the loop.
- `str`: Is the last word in `list1` after the loop has completed all iterations. This is because the loop iterates over each word in `list1`, and `str` will hold the value of the last word processed.
