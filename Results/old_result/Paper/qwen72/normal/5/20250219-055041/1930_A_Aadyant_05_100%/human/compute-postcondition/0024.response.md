The value of `s` (the sum of all elements at even indices in `list2`) is appended to the `final` list, which was initially an empty list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be an integer greater than 0, `num` is 0, `final` is a list containing the sum of all elements at even indices in `list2`, `s` is equal to the sum of all elements at even indices in `list2`, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all words in `list1` and must have at least one element, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string, `list1` is a list of words from `b` split by whitespace, `str` is the last word in `list1`, `i` is the last even index in `list2` or the length of `list2` if it is even.**
