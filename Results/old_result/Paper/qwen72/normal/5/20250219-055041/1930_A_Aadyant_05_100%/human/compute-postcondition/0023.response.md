Output State: **`n` must be an integer greater than 0, `num` is 0, `final` is an empty list, `s` is equal to the sum of all elements at even indices in `list2`, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all words in `list1` and must have at least one element, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string, `list1` is a list of words from `b` split by whitespace, `str` is the last word in `list1`, `i` is the last even index in `list2` or the length of `list2` if it is even.**

In natural language, this means:
- `n` remains an integer greater than 0.
- `num` remains 0.
- `final` remains an empty list.
- `s` is the sum of all elements at even indices in `list2`.
- `list2` is still a sorted list containing the integer values of all words in `list1`, and it must have at least one element.
- `a` and `b` remain the input strings.
- `list1` remains a list of words from `b` split by whitespace.
- `str` is still the last word in `list1`.
- `i` is the last even index in `list2` or the length of `list2` if it is even.
