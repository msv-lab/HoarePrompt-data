The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases and is constrained to the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. The list of lists contains `t` inner lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) with each integer `a_i` in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases. For each test case, the function processes the 2n integers and returns a specific value based on the processing logic.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists where each inner list contains 2n integers. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case.**
