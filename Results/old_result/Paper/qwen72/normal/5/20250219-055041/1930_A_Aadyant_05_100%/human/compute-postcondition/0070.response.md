The code `final.append(s)` appends the value of `s` to the list `final`. The value of `s` is the sum of all the elements at even indices in `list2`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be an integer greater than 2, `num` is 2, `final` is a list containing the values of `s` (which is the sum of all the elements at even indices in `list2`), `s` is the sum of all the elements at even indices in `list2`, `list1` is a list of strings resulting from splitting `b` by spaces, `i` is the last even index in `list2` (or `len(list2) - 1` if the length of `list2` is odd), `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all the strings in `list1`, `a` is the user input, `b` is the new user input.**
