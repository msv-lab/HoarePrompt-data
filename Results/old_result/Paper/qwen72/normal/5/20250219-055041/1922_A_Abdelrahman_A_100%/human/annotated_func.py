#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but within the function, it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `i` is `tests - 1`, `tests` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string, and `counter` is the length of `c`. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, `no` is False. Otherwise, `c` must have at least as many characters as the length of `a` and `b`, `counter` is the length of `a` or `b` (whichever is shorter), and `no` is True if all characters in `c` are found in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`. If `no` was initially True, it remains True after the if statement.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` containing lowercase Latin letters. The function reads the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and then, for each test case, it checks if the string `c` is either equal to `a` or `b`. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if each character in `c` is present in the corresponding positions of `a` or `b`. If any character in `c` is not found in the corresponding positions of `a` or `b`, it prints 'YES'. If all characters in `c` are found in the corresponding positions of `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
