The given `print` statement is:
```
print('NO')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `tests` must be greater than 2.
   - `slength` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a new input string.
   - `b` is a new input string.
   - `c` is a new input string.
   - `counter` is the length of `c`.
   - `no` is False.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is printing a string literal `'NO'`.

3. **Variables and Objects**:
   - The `print` statement does not reference any of the variables or objects defined in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables and objects in the initial state.

Output: **NO**
