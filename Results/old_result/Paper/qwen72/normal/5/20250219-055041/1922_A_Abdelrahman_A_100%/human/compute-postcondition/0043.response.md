Let's break down the initial state and the logic to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `tests` must be greater than 1.
   - `slength` is an input integer.
   - `a` is an input string.
   - `b` is a new input string.
   - `c` is a new input string.
   - `no` is initially set to False.
   - `counter` is the length of `c`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, `no` is False.
   - Otherwise, if `c` is not equal to `a` and `b`, `no` is False if no character in `c` was found that is not in the corresponding position of `a` or `b`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `no` is always set to False, regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - The `print('NO')` statement is executed, and it will always print 'NO' because the value of `no` does not affect the print statement.

Given this analysis, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **NO**
