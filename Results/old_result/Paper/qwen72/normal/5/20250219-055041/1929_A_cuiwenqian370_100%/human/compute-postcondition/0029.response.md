The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `results`. If `results` has more than one element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing at least one return value of `func_1(array)`, and `result` is the first element of `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least two elements, and `result` will be the second element of `results`.

State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 500, `results` is a list containing at least two return values of `func_1(array)`, `result` is the second element of `results`**
