You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the array has duplicate elements correctly. The problem description requires the maximum beauty of the array, which is achieved by sorting the array in non-decreasing order and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. However, the `func_1` function calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, which is not the correct way to compute the maximum beauty as defined in the problem.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
3 4 3 3
```
The expected output is 1, but the program will output 4 because it calculates the sum of absolute differences:
```
|4 - 3| + |3 - 3| + |3 - 3| = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1
```
However, the program will output:
```
|4 - 3| + |3 - 3| + |3 - 3| = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1
```
But if we rearrange the array to `[3, 3, 3, 4]`, the beauty would be:
```
(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
```
The correct approach should be to sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences without taking the absolute value, as the problem specifies the beauty as the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for `i` from 2 to `n`.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += array[i] - array[i - 1]
    return beauty
```
