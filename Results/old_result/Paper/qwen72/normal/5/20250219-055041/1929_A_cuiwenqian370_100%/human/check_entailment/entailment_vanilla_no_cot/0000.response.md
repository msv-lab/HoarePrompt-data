Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the way the beauty of the array is calculated in `func_1`. According to the problem, the beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`. However, in `func_1`, the beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])`.

To achieve the maximum beauty, Sasha should arrange the array such that the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` are maximized, which means the array should be sorted in descending order. This way, each difference `(a_i - a_{i-1})` will be positive and as large as possible.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort(reverse=True)
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += array[i - 1] - array[i]
    return beauty
```

With this correction, the program will correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array for each test case. The rest of the program (`func_2`) is correct in terms of reading input and processing multiple test cases.
