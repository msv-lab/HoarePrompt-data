Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 499, `index` is `3 + 2*n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(array)`, `n` is the integer value of the element at the position `2 + n` in the list `data`, `array` is a list of `n` integers starting from the element at position `3 + n` in `data` (i.e., `data[3 + n:3 + 2*n]` converted to integers).**
