Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 500, `index` is `1 + t + t*n`, `results` is a list containing `t` return values of `func_1(array)`, `n` is the integer value of the element at the position `1 + (t-1) + (t-1)*n` in the list `data`, `array` is a list of `n` integers starting from the element at position `2 + (t-1) + (t-1)*n` in `data`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)` for the last iteration.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `t` iterations:
- `t` remains the integer value of the first element in the list `data`, and it must be in the range 1 to 500.
- `index` is updated to `1 + t + t*n`, which is the position in the `data` list after all the elements used in the loop have been processed.
- `results` is a list containing `t` return values from the function `func_1(array)`, one for each iteration of the loop.
- `n` is the integer value of the element at the position `1 + (t-1) + (t-1)*n` in the list `data`, which is the value of `n` used in the last iteration.
- `array` is a list of `n` integers starting from the element at position `2 + (t-1) + (t-1)*n` in `data`, which is the array used in the last iteration.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)` for the last iteration.
