The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `array` and returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `array`. The function modifies the input list `array` to be sorted in ascending order. The length of the list remains the same as in the initial state, and the elements are within the range 1 to 10^9.
