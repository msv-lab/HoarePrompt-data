Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 498, `index` is `4 + 2*n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(array)` and the value of `result`, `n` is the integer value of the element at the position `3 + 2*n` in the list `data`, `array` is a list of `n` integers starting from the element at position `3 + n` in `data`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`**

The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing it from `3 + 2*n` to `4 + 2*n`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
