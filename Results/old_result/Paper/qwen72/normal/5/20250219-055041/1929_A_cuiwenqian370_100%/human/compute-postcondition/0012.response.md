The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 500. Since `t` is decremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be in the range 1 <= t <= 499.

The other variables (`index`, `results`, `n`, `array`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 499, `index` is `2 + n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(array)`, `n` is the integer value of the second element in the list `data`, `array` is a list of `n` integers starting from the third element in `data` (i.e., `data[2:2 + n]` converted to integers).**
