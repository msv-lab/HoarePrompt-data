Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 500, `results` is a list containing `t` return values of `func_1(array)`, `result` is the last element of `results`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `t` remains the same as it was in the initial state, which is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be within the range of 1 to 500.
- The list `results` contains exactly `t` return values from the function `func_1(array)`.
- The variable `result` holds the last element of the `results` list, which is the return value of `func_1(array)` from the last iteration of the loop.
