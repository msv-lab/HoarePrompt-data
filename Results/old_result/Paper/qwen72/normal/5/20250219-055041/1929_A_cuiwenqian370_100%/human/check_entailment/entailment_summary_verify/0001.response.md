### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the "beauty" of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Rearranging the elements of the array can change the beauty.

2. **Analyzing Function 1:**
   - **Sorting the Array:** The function `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order.
   - **Calculating Beauty:** It then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - **Absolute Differences:** The use of `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])` ensures that the differences are always non-negative.
   - **Summing Differences:** The sum of these absolute differences is returned as the beauty.

3. **Optimality of Sorting:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that sorting the array in ascending order is not the optimal way to maximize the beauty.
   - The optimal way to maximize the beauty is to sort the array in a way that maximizes the differences between consecutive elements. This can be achieved by alternating the largest and smallest elements.
   - For example, for the array \([2, 1, 3]\), the optimal arrangement is \([1, 3, 2]\) or \([3, 1, 2]\), which gives a beauty of \(2\).
   - For the array \([100, 54, 80, 43, 90]\), the optimal arrangement is \([43, 100, 54, 90, 80]\) or \([100, 43, 90, 54, 80]\), which gives a beauty of \(57\).

4. **Function 2:**
   - **Reading Input:** The function `func_2` reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - **Processing Test Cases:** It processes each test case by extracting the length \(n\) and the array elements.
   - **Calling Function 1:** It calls `func_1` to calculate the beauty of the array.
   - **Storing Results:** It stores the results in a list and prints them at the end.

5. **Input Handling:**
   - The input handling in `func_2` is correct. It reads the input, splits it, and processes each test case as described.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The current implementation of `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order, which does not maximize the beauty as required by the problem.
   - The correct approach should involve sorting the array in a way that maximizes the differences between consecutive elements, such as alternating the largest and smallest elements.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly maximize the beauty of the array as required by the problem. It sorts the array in ascending order, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\). The optimal approach should involve sorting the array in a way that alternates the largest and smallest elements to maximize the beauty.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
