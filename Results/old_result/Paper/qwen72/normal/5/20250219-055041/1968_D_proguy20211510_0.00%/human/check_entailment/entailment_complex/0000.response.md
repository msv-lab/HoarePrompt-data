### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` and converts them to integers.
   - It reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` and converts them to lists of integers.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if both Bodya and Sasha are initially at positions with the maximum value in `a`. If so, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
   - If only Bodya is at a position with the maximum value in `a`, it prints "Bodya" and continues.
   - If only Sasha is at a position with the maximum value in `a`, it prints "Sasha" and continues.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program initializes two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores of Bodya and Sasha for each turn.
   - It also initializes two boolean variables `founds` and `foundb` to track if either player has found a position with the maximum value in `a`.
   - For each turn up to `k`, it updates the scores and positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the rules of the game.
   - If both players have found positions with the maximum value in `a`, it appends the remaining score for the remaining turns as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to both `b` and `s`.

4. **Cumulative Scores:**
   - The program calculates the cumulative scores for Bodya and Sasha using the lists `b` and `s`.
   - It stores these cumulative scores in `preb` and `pres`.

5. **Final Scores:**
   - The program calculates the final scores for Bodya and Sasha by considering the remaining turns if they have found positions with the maximum value in `a`.
   - It stores these final scores in `ptsb` and `ptss`.

6. **Determine the Winner:**
   - The program compares the maximum values in `ptsb` and `ptss` to determine the winner.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Logic for Final Scores:**
  - The program incorrectly assumes that once a player finds a position with the maximum value in `a`, they will stay at that position for the remaining turns. This is not necessarily true because the game rules allow a player to either stay or move to `p_x`.
  - The program should simulate the game for all `k` turns and then determine the winner based on the final scores.

- **Redundant Calculations:**
  - The program calculates the cumulative scores and final scores separately, which is redundant. It should directly calculate the final scores for each player after simulating the game for `k` turns.

### Correctness:
- **False**

The program's logic for determining the final scores is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that players will stay at positions with the maximum value in `a` for the remaining turns, which is not always the optimal strategy. The program should simulate the game for all `k` turns and then determine the winner based on the final scores.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k, pb, ps = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize scores and positions
        score_bodya, score_sasha = 0, 0
        pos_bodya, pos_sasha = pb, ps
        
        # Simulate the game for k turns
        for _ in range(k):
            score_bodya += a[pos_bodya - 1]
            score_sasha += a[pos_sasha - 1]
            
            # Move to the next position or stay
            pos_bodya = p[pos_bodya - 1]
            pos_sasha = p[pos_sasha - 1]
        
        # Determine the winner
        if score_bodya > score_sasha:
            print('Bodya')
        elif score_bodya < score_sasha:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program simulates the game for all `k` turns and correctly determines the winner based on the final scores.
