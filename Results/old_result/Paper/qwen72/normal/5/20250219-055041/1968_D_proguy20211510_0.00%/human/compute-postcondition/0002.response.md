Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S` are integers such that 1 ≤ `P_B`, `P_S` ≤ `n` ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^9, representing the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively. `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ `n`, representing the permutation `p`. `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, representing the array `a`. The sum of values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO'. `MOD` is 1000000007. `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.**
