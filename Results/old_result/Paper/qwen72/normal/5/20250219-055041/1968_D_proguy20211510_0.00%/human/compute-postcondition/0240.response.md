Output State: **`i` is 0, `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index and must have at least one element, `rem` is `k - 1`, `ptsb` is a list that now contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`, `ptss` is a list that now contains the value `pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The list `pres` still contains the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index and must have at least one element.
- The value of `rem` remains `k - 1`.
- The list `ptsb` still contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`.
- The list `ptss` is updated to include the value `pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0]`.
