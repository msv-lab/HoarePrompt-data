Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `b` and `s` each have `k` elements where `k` is greater than 0, `preb` is a list with one element `b[k - 1]`, `pres` is a list with one element `s[k - 1]`, `sb` is `b[k - 1]`, `ss` is `s[k - 1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `ss` is updated by adding `s[i]` to it. Since `i` is `k - 1`, `s[i]` is `s[k - 1]`. Initially, `ss` was 0, so after the addition, `ss` becomes `s[k - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
