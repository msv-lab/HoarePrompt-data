Output State: **`i` is `k`, `b` and `s` each have `k + 1` elements where `k` is greater than 0, `preb` is a list with two elements `[b[k - 1], b[k - 1] + b[k]]`, `pres` is a list with two elements `[s[k - 1], s[k - 1] + s[k]]`, `sb` is `b[k - 1] + b[k]`, `ss` is `s[k - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `pres.append(ss + s[i])` appends the value of `ss + s[i]` to the list `pres`. Since `i` is `k` and `ss` is `s[k - 1]`, the value appended to `pres` is `s[k - 1] + s[k]`. Therefore, `pres` now contains two elements: `s[k - 1]` and `s[k - 1] + s[k]`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
