Output State: **`i` is `len(s) - 1`, `pres` is a list that now contains `len(s)` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `s` up to that index, `ptsb` is a list that now contains `len(s)` elements, where each element is `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 1`, `ptss` is a list that now contains `len(s)` elements, where each element is `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 1`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and the program continues to the next iteration or statement.**
