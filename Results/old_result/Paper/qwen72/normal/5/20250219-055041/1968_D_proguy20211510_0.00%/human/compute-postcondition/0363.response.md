The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `pres`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `pres`. If `pres` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The initial state of `i` is `len(s) - 1`, but this does not affect the loop's execution directly. For the loop to execute, `pres` must have at least one element, and `i` should start from 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `pres` is a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `s` up to that index, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list**
