Output State: **`i` is -1, `k` is greater than 0, `foundb` is false, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[pb - 1]`, and if `founds` is true, `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `k * maxa`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Additionally, `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`.**

The code snippet `b.append(a[pb - 1])` appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
