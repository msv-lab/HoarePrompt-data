Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `foundb` is true if `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `maxa`. If both `foundb` and `founds` are true, `b` and `s` each have a new element appended, which is equal to `(k - 1) * maxa`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. `founds` is true. The current value of `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`.**
