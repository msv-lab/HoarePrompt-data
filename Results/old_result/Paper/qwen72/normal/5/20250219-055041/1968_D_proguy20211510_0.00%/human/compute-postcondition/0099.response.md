The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the length of the list `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `s` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`i` is 1, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `preb` is a list that now contains one more element, which is the value of `sb` plus the first element of `s`, `sb` is updated to `sb + s[0]`, `pres` is a list that now contains one more element, which is the value of `ss` plus the first element of `s`, `ss` is updated to `ss + s[0]`**
