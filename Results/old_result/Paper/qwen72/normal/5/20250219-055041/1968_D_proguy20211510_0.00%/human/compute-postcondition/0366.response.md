Output State: **`i` is 0, `pres` is a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `s` up to that index, `ptsb` is a list with one element equal to `preb[0] + rem * b[0]`, `ptss` is a list with one element equal to `pres[0] + rem * s[0]`, `rem` is `k - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- `pres` remains a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `s` up to that index.
- `ptsb` remains a list with one element equal to `preb[0] + rem * b[0]`.
- `ptss` is now a list with one element, which is the result of `pres[0] + rem * s[0]`.
- `rem` remains `k - 1`.
