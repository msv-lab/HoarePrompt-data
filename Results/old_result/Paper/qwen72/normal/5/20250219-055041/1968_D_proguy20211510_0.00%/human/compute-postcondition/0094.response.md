The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `s`. If the list `s` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `i` should be 0, and the list `s` must have at least 1 element.

State: **`i` is 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element**
