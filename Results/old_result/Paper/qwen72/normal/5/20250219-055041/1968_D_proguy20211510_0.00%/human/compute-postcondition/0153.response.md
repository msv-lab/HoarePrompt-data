Output State: **`i` is -1, `k` is greater than 0, `foundb` is true, `founds` is true, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `(k - 0) * maxa`**. 

This means the list `b` now contains an additional element, which is the result of multiplying `k` (a value greater than 0) by `maxa`. The values of `i`, `k`, `foundb`, and `founds` remain unchanged.
