Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `foundb` is either true or false, `founds` is true, `s` has a new element appended which is `a[ps - 1]`.** 

The initial state is preserved, and the only change is that the list `s` now includes an additional element, which is the element at the index `ps - 1` of the list `a`.
