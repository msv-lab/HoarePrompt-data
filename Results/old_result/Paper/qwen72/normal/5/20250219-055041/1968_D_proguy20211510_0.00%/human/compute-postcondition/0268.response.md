The provided `print` statement is:
```
print('Bodya')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Bodya'`. The initial state describes various variables and lists, but none of these variables or lists are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the same string regardless of the values of the variables and lists described in the initial state.

Output: **Bodya**
