Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `(k - 2) * maxa`, `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `(k - 2) * maxa`.**

The code snippet appends a new element to the list `s`, which is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Given that `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `(k - 2) * maxa`. Therefore, the new element appended to `s` is the same as the element appended to `b`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
