The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `pres`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `pres` and the value of `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `pres`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `pres` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `pres` must have at least two elements.

State: **`i` is 1, `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index and must have at least two elements, `rem` is `k - 1`, `ptsb` is a list that now contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`, `ptss` is a list that now contains the value `pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0]`**
