Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, both `foundb` and `founds` are true, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `(k - 1) * maxa`, `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `(k - 1) * maxa`.**

The code snippet `s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)` appends a new element to the list `s`. Given that `i` is 0, the expression `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` simplifies to `(k - 1) * maxa`. Therefore, the new element appended to `s` is the same as the new element appended to `b`, which is `(k - 1) * maxa`. The other variables remain unchanged.
