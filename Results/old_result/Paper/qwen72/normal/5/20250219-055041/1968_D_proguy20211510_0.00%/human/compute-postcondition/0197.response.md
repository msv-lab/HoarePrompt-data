Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `foundb` is either true or false, and `founds` is either true or false. If `founds` is true, `s` is a list that includes the value `maxa`. If `foundb` is true and both `foundb` and `founds` are true, `b` is a list that includes the value `(k - 1) * maxa` and `maxa`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `foundb` is true but `founds` is false, the state of the program remains unchanged. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] == maxa` and `founds` is true, `b` is a list that includes the value `(k - 1) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] == maxa` and `founds` is false, `b` is a list that includes the value `a[pb - 1]` and the state of the program remains unchanged. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] != maxa` and both `foundb` and `founds` are true, `b` is a list that includes the value `(k - 1) * maxa` and the value `a[pb - 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] != maxa` and either `foundb` or `founds` is false, `b` is a list that includes the value `a[pb - 1]` and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `founds` is false and `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `s` has a new element appended which is `a[ps - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa` and `founds` is true, `s` has a new element appended which is `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa` and `founds` is false, `s` has a new element appended which is `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`.***
