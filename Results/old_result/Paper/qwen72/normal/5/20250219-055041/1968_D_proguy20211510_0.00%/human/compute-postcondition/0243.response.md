Output State: **`i` is 1, `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index and must have at least two elements, `rem` is `k - 2`, `ptsb` is a list that now contains the values `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]` and `preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1]`, `ptss` is a list that now contains the value `pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0]`**

Explanation:
- The code `ptsb.append(preb[i] + rem * b[i])` appends a new value to the list `ptsb`.
- The value appended is `preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1]`, since `i` is 1 and `rem` is `k - 2`.
- The initial value of `ptsb` is `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`, and now it contains an additional value.
- The other variables (`i`, `pres`, `rem`, `ptss`) remain unchanged.
