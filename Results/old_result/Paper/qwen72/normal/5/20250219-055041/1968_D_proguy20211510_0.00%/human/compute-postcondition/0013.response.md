Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. Additionally, `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, and `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`.**
