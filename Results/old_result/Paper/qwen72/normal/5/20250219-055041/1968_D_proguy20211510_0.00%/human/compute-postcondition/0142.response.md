The provided Python code snippet is:
```python
print('Bodya')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing a string literal `'Bodya'`.
- The initial state describes several variables and lists (`i`, `pres`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, `maxb`, `maxa`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`), but none of these variables or lists are used in the `print` statement.
- The string `'Bodya'` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Output:
Output: **Bodya**
