Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is -1, `pres` is an empty list, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, `maxs` is undefined, `maxb` is undefined, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is False, `foundb` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is -1, `k` is greater than 0, `foundb` is either true or false, and `founds` is either true or false. If `founds` is true, `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `k * maxa`, and `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`. If `founds` is false, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`. Additionally, if `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `foundb` is set to true, and `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `maxa`. If `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[pb - 1]`. In all cases, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `foundb` is either true or false, and `founds` is either true or false. If `founds` is true, `s` is a list that includes the value `maxa`. If `foundb` is true and both `foundb` and `founds` are true, `b` is a list that includes the value `(k - 1) * maxa` and `maxa`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `foundb` is true but `founds` is false, the state of the program remains unchanged. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] == maxa` and `founds` is true, `b` is a list that includes the value `(k - 1) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] == maxa` and `founds` is false, `b` is a list that includes the value `a[pb - 1]` and the state of the program remains unchanged. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] != maxa` and both `foundb` and `founds` are true, `b` is a list that includes the value `(k - 1) * maxa` and the value `a[pb - 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] != maxa` and either `foundb` or `founds` is false, `b` is a list that includes the value `a[pb - 1]` and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `founds` is false and `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `s` has a new element appended which is `a[ps - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa` and `founds` is true, `s` has a new element appended which is `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa` and `founds` is false, `s` has a new element appended which is `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `foundb` is either true or false, and `founds` is either true or false. If `founds` is true, `s` includes the value `maxa` and the new value `(k - 2) * maxa`. If `foundb` is true and `founds` is true, `b` includes the values `(k - 2) * maxa` and `maxa`. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] == maxa` and `founds` is true, `b` includes the values `(k - 2) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] != maxa` and `founds` is true, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `founds` is false and `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `s` includes the values `maxa`, `(k - 2) * maxa`, and `a[ps - 1]`. If `foundb` is true and `founds` is false, `b` includes the values `(k - 2) * maxa` and `maxa`. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] == maxa` and `founds` is false, `b` includes the values `(k - 2) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] != maxa` and `founds` is false, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa` and `founds` is false, `s` includes the value `a[ps - 1]` in addition to its previous values, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. In all other cases, the state of `b`, `pb`, `s`, and `ps` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
