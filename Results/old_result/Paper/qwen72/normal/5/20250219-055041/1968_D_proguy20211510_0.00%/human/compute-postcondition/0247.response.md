Output State: **`i` is 2, `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index and must have at least three elements, `rem` is `k - 3`, `ptsb` is a list that now contains the values `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`, `preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1]`, `preb[2] + (k - 3) * b[2]`, and `preb[2] + (k - 3) * b[2]`, `ptss` is a list that now contains the values `pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0]`, `pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1]`, and `pres[2] + (k - 3) * s[2]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The list `ptsb` is updated by appending the value `preb[2] + (k - 3) * b[2]` to it.
- The list `pres` remains unchanged.
- The value of `rem` remains `k - 3`.
- The list `ptss` remains unchanged.
