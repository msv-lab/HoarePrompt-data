Postcondition: **`i` is -1, `k` is greater than 0, `foundb` is either true or false, and `founds` is either true or false. If `founds` is true, `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `k * maxa`, and `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`. If `founds` is false, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`. Additionally, if `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `foundb` is set to true, and `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `maxa`. If `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[pb - 1]`. In all cases, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
