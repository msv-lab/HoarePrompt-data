Output State: **`i` is `k`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` is either true or false, `founds` is either true or false, `preb` is a list containing the values `sb + b[i]` and `sb + b[k]`, `pres` is a list containing the value `ss + s[i]`, `sb` is `b[i] + b[i]`, `ss` is `s[i]`, `s` must have a length greater than `k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sb` is updated to `b[i] + b[i]`.
- All other variables (`i`, `k`, `foundb`, `founds`, `preb`, `pres`, `ss`, and the condition that `s` must have a length greater than `k`) remain unchanged.
