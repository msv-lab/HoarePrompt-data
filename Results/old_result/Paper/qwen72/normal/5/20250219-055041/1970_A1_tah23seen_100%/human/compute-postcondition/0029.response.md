The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The function returns a string `ans` containing the characters from `s` at the indices specified by the first elements of all tuples in `d`, in the order they appear in `d`. The list `d` is sorted by the depth of the parentheses sequence in ascending order, with positions of the same depth sorted by their indices in descending order.

Functionality: **The function accepts a balanced parentheses sequence `s` and returns a string `ans` containing characters from `s` at indices specified by the first elements of tuples in `d`, where `d` is sorted by the depth of the parentheses in ascending order and by indices in descending order for the same depth.**
