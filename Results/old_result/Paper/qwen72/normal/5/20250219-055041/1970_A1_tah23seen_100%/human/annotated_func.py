    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with `d[0] = 0` and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `d[i]` is the depth of the parentheses sequence at position `i-1`. The final value of `d[n]` is 0, indicating that the parentheses sequence is balanced.

    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` at the indices specified by the first elements of all tuples in `d`, in the order they appear in `d`; `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the depth of the parentheses sequence in ascending order, and for positions with the same depth, they are sorted by their indices in descending order.
    return ans
    #The program returns a string `ans` containing the characters from `s` at the indices specified by the first elements of all tuples in `d`, in the order they appear in `d`. The string `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, and `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the depth of the parentheses sequence in ascending order, with positions of the same depth sorted by their indices in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")", which is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. It returns a string `ans` that contains the characters from `s` rearranged based on their depth in the parentheses sequence. Specifically, the characters are ordered by their depth in ascending order, and for characters at the same depth, they are ordered by their original indices in descending order. The original string `s` remains unchanged.
