Output State: **The program returns a string `ans` containing the characters from `s` at the indices specified by the first elements of all tuples in `d`, in the order they appear in `d`. The string `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, and `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the depth of the parentheses sequence in ascending order, with positions of the same depth sorted by their indices in descending order.**
