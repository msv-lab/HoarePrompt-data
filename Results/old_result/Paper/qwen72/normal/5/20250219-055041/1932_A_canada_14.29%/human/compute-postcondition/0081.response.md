Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 2 if a second '*' character is encountered, otherwise `thorn` is 0, `i` is the last character processed in the loop, `_` is incremented by 1, `len` is the integer value of the input.**

The value of `ret` is set to 0. The other variables (`s`, `thorn`, `i`, `_`, `len`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
