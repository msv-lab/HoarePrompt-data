Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list `s`, `thorn` remains 0, `ret` is increased by 1 if `i` is '@', otherwise `thorn` is increased by 1 if `i` is '*', and if `thorn` reaches 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not equal to '@' or '*', `thorn` remains 0.**
