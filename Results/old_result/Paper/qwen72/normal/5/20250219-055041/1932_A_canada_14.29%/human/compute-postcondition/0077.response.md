To determine what will be printed by the `print(ret)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **`s` is a list of characters from the input string**: This means `s` contains the characters of the input string in the order they appear.

2. **`ret` is the number of '@' characters encountered before the second '*' character**: This means `ret` counts the occurrences of the character '@' in the list `s` up to the point where the second '*' character is encountered.

3. **`thorn` is 2 if a second '*' character is encountered, otherwise `thorn` is 0**: This indicates that `thorn` is a binary flag that is set to 2 if the second '*' character is found in the list `s`, and remains 0 otherwise.

4. **`i` is the last character processed in the loop**: This means `i` is the last character in the list `s` that was processed before the loop either breaks or completes.

5. **`_` is the number of characters processed before the loop breaks or completes**: This indicates the total number of characters processed in the list `s` before the loop either encounters the second '*' character or finishes processing the entire list.

6. **`len` remains the initial input integer**: This means the variable `len` is not modified and retains its initial value, which is the length of the input string.

Given these conditions, the `print(ret)` statement will print the value of `ret`, which is the count of '@' characters encountered before the second '*' character.

Since the exact input string is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ret`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of '@' characters up to the point where the second '*' character is encountered.

Output: **ret (where ret is the number of '@' characters encountered before the second '*' character in the list `s`)**
