Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the first character in the list `s`, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `len` is the integer value of the input, and `i` is not equal to '@' or '*'**

The code snippet `thorn == 0` is a condition check and does not change any variable values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
