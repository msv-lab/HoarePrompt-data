Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of n characters ('.', '@', '*') representing the path. The first character of each string is always '.'.**

However, since the provided function definition does not include parameters, it should be corrected to match the problem description:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of n characters ('.', '@', '*') representing the path. The first character of each string is always '.'.**
