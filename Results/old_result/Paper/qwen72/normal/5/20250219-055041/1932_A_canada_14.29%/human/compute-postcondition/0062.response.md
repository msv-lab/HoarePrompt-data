Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the list, `ret` is 0 if the first character is not '@', otherwise `ret` is 1, `thorn` is 1 if the first character is not '*' and is not '@', otherwise `thorn` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
