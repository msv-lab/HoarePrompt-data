Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of `n` characters from the input. The function then counts the number of occurrences of the character `@` in the string `s` before the second occurrence of the character `*`. If the second `*` is encountered, the counting stops. The function prints the count for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input strings are processed, and the counts are printed for each test case. The final state of the program includes the printed counts and the input variables remain as they were read from the input. **
