Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', `thorn` is 0 and `ret` is increased by 1. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is incremented by 1 and `ret` remains unchanged. If `thorn` was equal to 2 before the increment, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `i` is neither '@' nor '*', both `thorn` and `ret` remain unchanged.***
