To determine what will be printed by the `print(ret)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **`ret`**: This variable is defined as the number of '@' characters in the string `s` up to the point where the second '*' character is encountered.
2. **`thorn`**: This variable is defined as 2 if the loop breaks due to encountering the second '*', otherwise it is the number of consecutive '*' characters encountered.
3. **`i`**: This variable is the last character processed in the loop.

Given the initial state, we need to focus on the value of `ret`:

- The loop processes the string `s` character by character.
- It counts the number of '@' characters until it encounters the second '*' character.
- The loop breaks as soon as the second '*' is encountered.

Since the exact string `s` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ret`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the `print(ret)` statement will output the count of '@' characters up to the point where the second '*' is encountered.

Output: **ret (where ret is the number of '@' characters in the string `s` up to the point where the second '*' character is encountered)**
