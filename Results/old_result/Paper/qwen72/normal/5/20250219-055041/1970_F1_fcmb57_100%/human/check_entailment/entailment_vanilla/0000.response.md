### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions of the field `n` and `m`.
   - It initializes dictionaries for `players` and `goals` and a dictionary for `movements`.
   - It reads the field and correctly identifies and stores the positions of players and goals.

2. **Movement Function:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle the movement of players. It takes the current position `(x, y)` and the movement direction `(dx, dy)` and returns the new position `(x + dx, y + dy)`.
   - This function is used to update the player positions when they move.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program reads the number of moves `T` and then simulates each move.
   - For each move, it checks if the move is a direction (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), and if so, it updates the player's position using `func_1`.
   - If the move is a throw (`T`), it checks if the player is at a goal position.
   - If the player is at a red goal, it increments the blue team's score and prints the event.
   - If the player is at a blue goal, it increments the red team's score and prints the event.

4. **Final Score Output:**
   - After processing all the moves, the program prints the final score in the format `FINAL SCORE: r b`, where `r` is the score of the red team and `b` is the score of the blue team.

### Issues:
- **Quaffle Handling:**
  - The program does not handle the Quaffle's movement or the player's ability to catch and throw the Quaffle. The Quaffle's position is not tracked, and there is no mechanism to check if a player is carrying the Quaffle.
  - This is a critical issue because the problem description specifies that a player must catch the Quaffle before throwing it, and the Quaffle must be thrown to the correct goal to score a point.

- **Goal Scoring Logic:**
  - The program incorrectly checks if the player is at a goal position without considering whether they are carrying the Quaffle.
  - The program also does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal, which should award a point to the opposing team.

### Conclusion:
The program is incomplete and does not correctly handle the Quaffle's movement, player actions, and goal scoring logic as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
