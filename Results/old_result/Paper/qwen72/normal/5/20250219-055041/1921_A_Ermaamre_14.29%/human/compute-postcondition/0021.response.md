Postcondition: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are input integers, `x2` and `y2` are input integers, `x3` and `y3` are input integers, `x4` and `y4` are input integers, and `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`. Additionally, either `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `x3` is not equal to `x4`. The current value of `y1` is less than the current value of `y2`.**
