To determine what will be printed by the `print(res ** 2)` statement, we need to analyze the conditions under which `res` is defined and its value based on the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `a` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are input integers.
- If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y1` and `y3`.
- If `x1 != x4` or `x3 != x2`, `res` remains undefined.
- If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`**
   - If both conditions are true, `res` is defined as `abs(y1 - y3)`.
   - The `print(res ** 2)` statement will print the square of `abs(y1 - y3)`.

2. **Condition 2: `x1 != x4` or `x3 != x2`**
   - If either of these conditions is true, `res` remains undefined.
   - The `print(res ** 2)` statement will raise a `NameError` because `res` is not defined.

3. **Condition 3: `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`**
   - If both conditions are true, `res` is defined as `abs(y2 - y1)`.
   - The `print(res ** 2)` statement will print the square of `abs(y2 - y1)`.

### Conclusion:
- If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, the output will be `abs(y1 - y3) ** 2`.
- If `x1 != x4` or `x3 != x2`, the output will be a `NameError` because `res` is not defined.
- If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, the output will be `abs(y2 - y1) ** 2`.

Since the exact values of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y1`, `y2`, `y3`, and `y4` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the conditions given.

Output: **res ** 2 (where res is defined as `abs(y1 - y3)` if `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, or `abs(y2 - y1)` if `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, otherwise a `NameError` is raised because `res` is not defined)**
