Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are input integers, `x2` and `y2` are input integers, `x3` and `y3` are input integers, `x4` and `y4` are input integers, `x1` is equal to `x2`, `x3` is equal to `x4`, and either `x1` is not equal to `x3` or `x2` is not equal to `x4`. If `y1` < `y2`, `res` is equal to `y2 - y1`. If `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, `res` is equal to `y1 - y2`.***
