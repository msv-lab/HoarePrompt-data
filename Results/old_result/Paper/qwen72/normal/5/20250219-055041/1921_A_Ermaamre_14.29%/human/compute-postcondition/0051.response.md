Output State: **`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are input integers, `x2` and `y2` are input integers, `x3`, `y3` are input integers, `x4` and `y4` are input integers, and `res` remains undefined.**

The code snippet `x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `x3` and `y3` to be the integers provided by the user input, split by a space. The other variables remain unchanged.
