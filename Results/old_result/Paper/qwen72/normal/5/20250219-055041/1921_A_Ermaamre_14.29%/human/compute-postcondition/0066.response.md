Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `a-1`, and for each iteration, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are input integers. If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then if `y1 < y3`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`. If `y1` is greater than or equal to `y3`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`. If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, or if `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. For each iteration, the square of `res` is printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `a` iterations, the value of `i` will be `a-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration. For each iteration, the loop reads four pairs of coordinates representing the corners of a square. If the coordinates indicate that the square is aligned with the axes, the loop calculates the side length of the square and prints the square of this side length. If the coordinates do not form a valid square aligned with the axes, the loop does not define `res` for that iteration. The loop will have printed the square of the side length for each valid square in the input.
