The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `a` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `a` must be greater than 2.

State: **`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are input integers. If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then if `y1 < y3`, `res` is the absolute value of `y3 - y1`. Otherwise, `res` is the absolute value of `y1 - y3`. If `x1 != x4` or `x3 != x2`, `res` remains undefined. If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then if `y1 < y2`, `res` is the absolute value of `y2 - y1`. Otherwise, `res` is the absolute value of `y1 - y2`.**
