Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided is incorrect because it does not handle the coordinates of the square's corners correctly. The logic in the program assumes a specific order of the coordinates, which is not guaranteed by the problem description. The coordinates of the square's corners are given in random order, and the program needs to identify the correct pairs of coordinates to calculate the side length of the square.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Random Order**: The program checks specific pairs of coordinates (e.g., `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`) to determine the side length, but this approach will fail if the coordinates are not in the expected order.
2. **Redundant Conditions**: The conditions `x1 == x3 and x2 == x4`, `x1 == x2 and x3 == x4`, and `x1 == x4 and x3 == x2` are not necessary. The side length of the square can be determined by finding the unique differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you should:
1. Collect all x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
2. Find the unique differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
3. The side length of the square is the absolute difference between the two unique x-coordinates (or y-coordinates, since the square's sides are parallel to the axes).
4. Calculate the area as the side length squared.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        corners = []
        for _ in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            corners.append((x, y))
        
        # Extract all x and y coordinates
        x_coords = [corner[0] for corner in corners]
        y_coords = [corner[1] for corner in corners]
        
        # Find the unique differences
        side_length_x = max(x_coords) - min(x_coords)
        side_length_y = max(y_coords) - min(y_coords)
        
        # The side length of the square should be the same in both dimensions
        side_length = side_length_x  # or side_length_y, they should be equal
        
        # Calculate the area
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program will handle the coordinates in any order and correctly compute the area of the square.
