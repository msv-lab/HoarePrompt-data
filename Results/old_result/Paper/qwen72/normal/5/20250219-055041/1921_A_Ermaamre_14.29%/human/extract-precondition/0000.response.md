Precondition: **The function should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and there is exactly one square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area for each test case. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 <= t <= 100.**

However, the provided function definition `def func():` does not match the problem description. It should be updated to accept the input as described. Here is a more appropriate function definition:

```python
def find_square_area(test_cases):
```

Precondition: **test_cases is a list of lists, where each inner list contains four tuples, each tuple representing the coordinates (x_i, y_i) of a corner of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and there is exactly one square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area for each test case. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 <= t <= 100.**
