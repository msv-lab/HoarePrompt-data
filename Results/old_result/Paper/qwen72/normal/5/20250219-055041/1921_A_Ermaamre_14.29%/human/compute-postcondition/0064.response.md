Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are input integers. If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y1` and `y3`. If `x1 != x4` or `x3 != x2`, `res` remains undefined. If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1`.***
