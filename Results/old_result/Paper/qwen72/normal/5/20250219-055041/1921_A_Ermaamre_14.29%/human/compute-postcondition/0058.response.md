Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are input integers, and `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1`. If `y1` < `y2`, `res` is the absolute value of `y2 - y1`. Otherwise, `res` is the absolute value of `y1 - y2`.***
