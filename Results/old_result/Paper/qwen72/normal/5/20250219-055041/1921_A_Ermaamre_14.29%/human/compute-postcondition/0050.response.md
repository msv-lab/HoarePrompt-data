Output State: **`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are input integers, `x2` and `y2` are input integers, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are input integers, and `res` remains undefined.**

The code snippet `x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())` takes an input string, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer, assigning them to `x2` and `y2` respectively. The values of `x1` and `y1`, as well as `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4`, remain unchanged as input integers. The variable `res` is still undefined, and `a` remains greater than 2, and `i` remains 2.
