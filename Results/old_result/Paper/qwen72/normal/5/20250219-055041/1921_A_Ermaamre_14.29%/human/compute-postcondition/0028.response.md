Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are input integers. If `x1` is equal to `x3` and `x2` is equal to `x4`, then if `y1` < `y3`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`. If `y1` is greater than or equal to `y3`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`. Otherwise, if `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, or if `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. If none of the above conditions are met, the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` remain unchanged.***
