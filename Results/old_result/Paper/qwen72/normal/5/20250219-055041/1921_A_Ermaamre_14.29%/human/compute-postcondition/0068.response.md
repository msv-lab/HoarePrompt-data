Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a series of test cases from the input. Each test case consists of four pairs of coordinates (x_i, y_i) representing the corners of a square. The function calculates the side length of the square by finding the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the appropriate pairs of points. It then prints the area of the square (side length squared) for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the input coordinates have been processed, and the areas of the squares have been printed for each test case. **
