The only objects in the loop head are the variables `r` and the list `vals`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `vals`. If `vals` has at least two elements, the loop will execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `vals` must have at least one element, `prod` is now equal to the first element of `vals`, and `r` is the first element of `vals`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `vals` must have at least two elements. At the start of the next iteration, `r` will be the second element of `vals`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of test cases, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `prod` is now equal to the first element of `vals`, `r` is the second element of `vals`.**
