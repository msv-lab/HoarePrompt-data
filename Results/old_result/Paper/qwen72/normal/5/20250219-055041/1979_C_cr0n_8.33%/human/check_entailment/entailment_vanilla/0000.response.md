### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total amount bet is the sum of all `x_i` values, and it must be less than `k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_N`.
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`.
   - It then calculates `vprod` as the list of `prod // k_i` for each `k_i`.
   - The denominator `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` and returns, indicating no solution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the `vprod` list as the distribution of coins.

3. **Mathematical Analysis:**
   - The key idea is to ensure that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The program uses the product of all multipliers `prod` and divides it by each multiplier to get `vprod`.
   - The sum of `vprod` should be strictly less than `prod` for the solution to be valid.
   - If `prod - sum(vprod) <= 0`, it means the total amount bet is not strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, and thus, there is no valid solution.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic of using `prod` and `vprod` is based on the fact that `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, ensuring that the distribution is valid.
   - The condition `prod - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The program correctly handles the case where no valid solution exists by printing `-1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the multipliers are all the same (e.g., `5 5 5 5 5`), which should result in `-1` because it's impossible to distribute the coins such that the total bet is less than the amount received back for any outcome.
   - The program also handles the case where the multipliers are different and a valid distribution exists.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the distribution of coins for each test case and handles the edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
