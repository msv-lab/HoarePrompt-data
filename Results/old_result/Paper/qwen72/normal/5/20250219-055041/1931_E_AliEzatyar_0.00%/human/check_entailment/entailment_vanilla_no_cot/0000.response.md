Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Typographical Error**: The program outputs `'Sashah'` instead of `'Sasha'`. This is a typo and should be corrected.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Total Digits**: The program calculates the total number of digits in the list correctly, but it incorrectly handles the logic for the number of trailing zeros. The function `func_1` is supposed to count the number of trailing zeros in a string representation of a number, but the way it is used in the main loop is not optimal for determining the game outcome.

3. **Incorrect Winning Condition**: The condition `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:` is not the correct way to determine the winner. The game is about the final number being greater than or equal to \(10^m\), not just the total number of digits minus some trailing zeros.

4. **Optimal Play Consideration**: The program does not consider the optimal play for both players. For example, Anna can reverse the digits of any number, and Sasha can concatenate any two numbers. The program should simulate the optimal moves for both players to determine the winner.

### Correct Approach:
To determine the winner, we need to consider the following:

- **Anna's Move**: Anna can reverse any number, which might change the number of digits in the final concatenated number.
- **Sasha's Move**: Sasha can concatenate any two numbers, which will always increase the number of digits in the list.
- **Winning Condition**: The game ends when there is exactly one number left in the list. Sasha wins if this number is greater than or equal to \(10^m\).

A more correct approach would involve:

1. **Counting the Maximum Number of Digits**: Determine the maximum number of digits that can be achieved by any combination of reversing and concatenating.
2. **Optimal Strategy**: Simulate the optimal strategy for both players, considering that Anna will always try to minimize the number of digits and Sasha will try to maximize it.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def reverse_number(num):
    return int(str(num)[::-1])

def can_sasha_win(array, m):
    # Anna's move: reverse the digits of any number
    reversed_array = [reverse_number(num) for num in array]
    
    # Sasha's move: concatenate any two numbers
    # The maximum number of digits in the final number
    max_digits = max(len(str(num)) for num in reversed_array)
    
    # If the maximum number of digits is greater than or equal to m, Sasha can win
    return max_digits >= m

n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if can_sasha_win(array, m):
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'

for answer in answers:
    print(answer)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly determines the winner based on the optimal play for both players.
