Postcondition: **`i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and contains the accumulated values of `s` at each step of the loop, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and `d2[start]` is `s`, `t` is greater than `m`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user and `len(lst)` must be greater than 1, `inc` is -1. If `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `start - 1` is greater than -1, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`. If `start - 1` is not greater than -1, `s` remains unchanged. In all cases, `mini` remains unchanged.**
