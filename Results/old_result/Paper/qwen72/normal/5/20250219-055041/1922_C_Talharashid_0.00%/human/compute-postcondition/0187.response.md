Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `start` is `len(lst) - 1` and `start` must be greater than or equal to 1, `end` is 0, `s` is 1, `d1[start]` is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between adjacent elements in the list `lst` from the initial `start` to `end - 1`, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`. Additionally, the current value of `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.**
