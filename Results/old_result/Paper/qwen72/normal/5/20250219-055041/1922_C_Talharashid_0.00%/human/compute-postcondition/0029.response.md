Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is `start + inc`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1` and `end` must be greater than 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[0] - lst[start + inc])`, and `d1[start]` is now equal to `s`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mini` is updated to the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and its previous value.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
