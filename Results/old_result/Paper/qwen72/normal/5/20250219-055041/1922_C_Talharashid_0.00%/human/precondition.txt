t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n integers in ascending order where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and each query (x_i, y_i) is a pair of integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. Additionally, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
