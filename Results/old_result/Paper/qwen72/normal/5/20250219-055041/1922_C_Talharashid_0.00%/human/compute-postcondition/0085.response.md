Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user such that `len(lst) > 1`, `start` is `len(lst) - 4`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `mini` remains the same, `s` is incremented by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, and `d2[start]` is now `s`.**

Explanation:
- The code `s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` increments `s` by the absolute difference between the element at index `start` and the element at index `start + inc` in the list `lst`.
- Since `inc` is -1, `start + inc` refers to the element immediately before `start` in the list.
- The value of `s` is updated, and this new value of `s` is stored in `d2[start]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
