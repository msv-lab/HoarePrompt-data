Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is 0, `start` is an input integer - 1, `end` is an input integer - 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0. If `start` < `end`, `s1` is the absolute value of the difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute value of the difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s1` is the absolute value of the difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute value of the difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`. `t` must be greater than `m`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `d1` as a defaultdict with a default value of 0. This means that any key accessed in `d1` that does not exist will default to 0. The initial values of `i`, `m`, `s`, `start`, `end`, `s1`, `s2`, and `t` remain unchanged, but `d1` is now a defaultdict. The conditions for `s1` and `s2` based on the values of `start` and `end` are still valid.
