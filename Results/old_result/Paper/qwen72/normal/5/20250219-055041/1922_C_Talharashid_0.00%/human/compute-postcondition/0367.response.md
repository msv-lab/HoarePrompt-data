The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `m` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`. If `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end - 1]` and `d2[start - 1]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.**
