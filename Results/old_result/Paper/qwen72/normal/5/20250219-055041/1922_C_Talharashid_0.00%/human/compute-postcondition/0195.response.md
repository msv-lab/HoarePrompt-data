Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and the previous value of `mini`, `s` is 1 if `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`; otherwise, `s` is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `d2[start]` is `s`.**
