Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s1` is the absolute value of the difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s2` is the absolute value of the difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.** 

Explanation:
- The code snippet `s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` assigns the absolute value of the difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` to `s1`.
- The initial state specifies that `start` is `start - 1` and `end` is `end - 1`, so these values are used in the calculation.
- The other variables (`i`, `m`, `s`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for `s2` is not affected by the code snippet, so the initial state for `s2` remains as specified.
