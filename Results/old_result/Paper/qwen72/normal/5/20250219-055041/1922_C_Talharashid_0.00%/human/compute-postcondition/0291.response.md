Postcondition: **`i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `start` is 2, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `t` is greater than `m`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `inc` is 1, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[2] - lst[3])` and 11111111 if `start + 1 < len(lst)`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.**
