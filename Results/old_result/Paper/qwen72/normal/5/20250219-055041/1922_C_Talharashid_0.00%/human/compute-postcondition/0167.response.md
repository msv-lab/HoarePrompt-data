Postcondition: ***`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is `start + inc` from the previous iteration, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `d1[start]` is now `s`. If `start - 1 > -1` and `start + 1 < len(lst)`, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`, and `s` is `s + 1` if `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, otherwise `s` is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`. If `start - 1 > -1` but `start + 1` is not less than `len(lst)`, the variables remain unchanged. If `start - 1` is not greater than -1, the variables also remain unchanged.***
