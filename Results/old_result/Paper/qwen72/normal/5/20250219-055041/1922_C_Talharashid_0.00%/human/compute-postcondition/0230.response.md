To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(m):`, so the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `m`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 0
- `m` is greater than 0
- `start` is `start - 1`
- `end` is `end - 1`
- `s` is 0
- `s1` and `s2` are defined based on the conditions involving `start` and `end`

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.
- `m` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue executing, so `m` must be greater than 1.

The other variables (`start`, `end`, `s`, `s1`, and `s2`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0. If `start` < `end`, `s1` is the absolute value of the difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute value of the difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s1` is the absolute value of the difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute value of the difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.**
