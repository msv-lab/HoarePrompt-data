Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `start` is 1, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and `d1[1]` is `s + abs(lst[1] - lst[2])`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `t` is greater than `m`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `inc` is 1, and `mini` is updated to `min(abs(lst[1] - lst[0]), mini)` if `start - 1 > -1`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is incremented by the absolute difference between `lst[1]` and `lst[2]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- `d1[1]` is updated to the new value of `s`, which is `s + abs(lst[1] - lst[2])`.
- The conditions for `mini` remain the same as in the initial state.
