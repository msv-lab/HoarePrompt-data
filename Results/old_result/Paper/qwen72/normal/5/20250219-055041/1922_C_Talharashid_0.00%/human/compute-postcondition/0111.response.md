Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`.**

The code snippet `s1 = abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` calculates the absolute difference between the values of `d2` at indices `end` and `start`, and assigns this value to `s1`. The values of `d2` are taken from the defaultdict `d2`, which has a default value of 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
