Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d2[end - 1] - d2[start - 1])`, and `start` is greater than or equal to `end`**

Explanation:
- `s1` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `d2[end - 1]` and `d2[start - 1]`.
- The values of `i`, `m`, `start`, `end`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `start` is greater than or equal to `end` still holds true.
