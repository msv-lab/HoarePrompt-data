Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`.**

The code snippet `s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` calculates the absolute difference between the values of `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` and assigns it to `s2`. The values of `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` are retrieved from the `defaultdict` `d2`, which defaults to 0 if the keys `start` or `end` are not present. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
