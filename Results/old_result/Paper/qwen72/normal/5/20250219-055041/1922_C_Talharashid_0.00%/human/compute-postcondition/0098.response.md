Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` remains 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is an input integer minus 1, `end` is an input integer minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`.**

In natural language: The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the values of `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` and assigns this difference to `s2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The value of `s2` is now the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`.
