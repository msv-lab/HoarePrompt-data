Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s1` is the absolute value of the difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`.** 

In natural language: The initial state remains the same, but a new variable `s1` is created and assigned the value of the absolute difference between the elements at the `end` and `start` indices of the list `d2`. The values of `i`, `m`, `start`, `end`, and `s` remain unchanged, and `start` is still greater than or equal to `end`.
