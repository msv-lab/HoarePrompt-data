Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. `i` and `j` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`.
- The values of `i` and `j` are not changed by this code snippet.
- The other variables (`a`, `k`, `c`, `t1`, `t2`) retain their initial values and conditions.
