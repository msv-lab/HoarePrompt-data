Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers and must have at least one element, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])` calculates the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` of the lists `a` and `c`.
- The value of `t1` is now the result of this calculation.
- The initial state variables `a` and `k` remain unchanged.
- The index `i` is not specified, so the exact value of `t1` depends on the values of `a[i]` and `c[i]` at the given index.
