Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the input.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from a new input.
- `c` is a sorted list of integers read from a new input in descending order.
- `ans` is the sum of the maximum differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` for each iteration.
- `i` is the number of iterations where `t1` was not greater than `t2`.
- `j` is the number of iterations where `t2` was greater than `t1` plus 1.
- `k` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `_` is incremented by 1, and the loop will execute one more time if the total number of iterations specified by `int(input())` is greater than the current value of `_`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(0)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.
- The value `0` is a constant and will be printed as is.

### Output:
Output: **0**
