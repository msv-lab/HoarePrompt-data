Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned the integer values from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input in descending order, `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 0, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`, and if `t2` > `t1`, `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding the maximum value between `t1` and `t2` to it.
- The initial value of `ans` was 0, so after the execution, `ans` is now `max(t1, t2)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged or retain their initial conditions.
