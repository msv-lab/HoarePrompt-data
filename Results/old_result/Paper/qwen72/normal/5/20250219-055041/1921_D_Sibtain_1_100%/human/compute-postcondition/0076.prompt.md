Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are assigned the integer values from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input, `c` is now a sorted list of integers read from the new input in descending order, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `_` is incremented by 1, and the loop will execute one more time if the total number of iterations specified by `int(input())` is greater than the current value of `_`. If all elements in `a` and `c` are the same and equal to each other, the program retains the above state. If `len(a) == 1`, the program retains the above state.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(len(a)):
    t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
    t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
    if t2 > t1:
        j += 1
    else:
        i += 1
    ans += max(t1, t2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input and must have at least one element, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is 1 or 2, `k` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1, and the loop will execute one more time if the total number of iterations specified by `int(input())` is greater than the current value of `_`. If all elements in `a` and `c` are the same and equal to each other, or if `len(a) == 1`, the program retains the above state. `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`. `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - 1]` and `c[len(c) - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input and must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` and the previous value of `ans`, `i` is either 0 or 1 if `t2 > t1` and either 1 or 2 otherwise, `j` is 2 or 3 if `t2 > t1` and 1 or 2 otherwise, `k` is 1, `_` is incremented by 1, and the loop will execute one more time if the total number of iterations specified by `int(input())` is greater than the current value of `_`. `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]` if `t2 > t1` and between `a[i-1]` and `c[i-1]` otherwise. `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` and the previous value of `ans`, `n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input and must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input in descending order, `k` is 2, `_` is incremented by 1, and the loop will execute one more time if the total number of iterations specified by `int(input())` is greater than the current value of `_`. If `t2 > t1`, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is 3 or 4. Otherwise, `i` is either 1 or 2, and `j` is 2 or 3. `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
