Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned new integer values from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input and must have at least one element, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, `i` is the number of times `t1` was not greater than `t2`, `j` is the number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` plus 1, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `_` is incremented by 1, and the total number of iterations specified by `int(input())` must be greater than the current value of `_`. If `a` and `c` both contain only one unique element and that element is the same in both lists, then all these conditions are retained. Otherwise, the conditions are also retained, but no additional changes are made.**
