Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, `j` is increased by 1. If `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`, `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t1` is updated to be the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`.
- The values of `a`, `k`, `t2`, `ans`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The initial state conditions for `a`, `k`, `t2`, `ans`, `i`, and `j` are still valid.
- The new value of `t1` is now the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` in lists `a` and `c`.
