t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. cases is a list of tuples, each containing two lists: the first list has n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) and the second list has m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9), where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
