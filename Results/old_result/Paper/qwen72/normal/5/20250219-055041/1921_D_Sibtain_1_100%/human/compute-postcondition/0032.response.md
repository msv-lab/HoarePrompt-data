Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned the integer values from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input in descending order, `ans` is `max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `i` is 1 if `t2` > `t1`, otherwise `i` is 2, `j` is 3 if `t2` > `t1`, otherwise `j` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])` updates the value of `t1` to the absolute difference between the `i`-th element of `a` and the `i`-th element of `c`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, and `t2` remain unchanged.
- The values of `i` and `j` are determined by the condition `t2 > t1`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is 2 and `j` is 1.
