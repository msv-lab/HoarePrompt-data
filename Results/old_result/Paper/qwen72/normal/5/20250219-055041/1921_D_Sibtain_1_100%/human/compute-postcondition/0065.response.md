Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input and must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input in descending order, `ans` is the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is 2 or 3, `k` is 1, `_` is incremented by 1, and the loop will execute one more time if the total number of iterations specified by `int(input())` is greater than the current value of `_`. `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`. `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`.**
