Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned the integer values from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input, `c` is now a sorted list of integers read from the new input in descending order, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `_` is incremented by 1, and the loop will execute one more time if the total number of iterations specified by `int(input())` is greater than the current value of `_`. If all elements in `a` and `c` are the same and equal to each other, the program retains the above state. If `len(a) == 1`, the program retains the above state.**
