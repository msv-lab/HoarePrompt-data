### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and the signs must occur sequentially. Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases, `num_tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs, `n`, and then a list of integers `nums` representing the periodicities of the signs.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the year in which the current sign occurs.

3. **Iterating Through Signs:**
   - The program iterates through each sign's periodicity in the list `nums`.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by finding the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than or equal to the current `start_year`.
   - This is done using the expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which ensures that the next occurrence is strictly after the current `start_year`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs, the program prints the `start_year` for the current test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Correctness of the Calculation:**
  - The expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` correctly calculates the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.
  - This ensures that the signs occur sequentially and strictly after the previous sign.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly, as it will simply return the first sign's periodicity.
  - The program also handles the case where all signs have the same periodicity (e.g., `1 1 1 1 1`), as it will correctly calculate the year based on the sequential requirement.

- **Test Case Validation:**
  - The program correctly processes multiple test cases by using a while loop that runs `num_tests` times.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Input:**
   ```
   4
   6
   3 2 4 5 9 18
   5
   1 2 3 4 5
   5
   1 1 1 1 1
   6
   50 30 711 200 503 1006
   ```

2. **Output:**
   - For the first test case:
     - `3 2 4 5 9 18`
     - `start_year` starts at 0.
     - After the first sign: `start_year = 3` (3 is the smallest multiple of 3 greater than 0).
     - After the second sign: `start_year = 4` (4 is the smallest multiple of 2 greater than 3).
     - After the third sign: `start_year = 8` (8 is the smallest multiple of 4 greater than 4).
     - After the fourth sign: `start_year = 10` (10 is the smallest multiple of 5 greater than 8).
     - After the fifth sign: `start_year = 18` (18 is the smallest multiple of 9 greater than 10).
     - After the sixth sign: `start_year = 36` (36 is the smallest multiple of 18 greater than 18).
     - Output: `36`

   - For the second test case:
     - `1 2 3 4 5`
     - `start_year` starts at 0.
     - After the first sign: `start_year = 1` (1 is the smallest multiple of 1 greater than 0).
     - After the second sign: `start_year = 2` (2 is the smallest multiple of 2 greater than 1).
     - After the third sign: `start_year = 3` (3 is the smallest multiple of 3 greater than 2).
     - After the fourth sign: `start_year = 4` (4 is the smallest multiple of 4 greater than 3).
     - After the fifth sign: `start_year = 5` (5 is the smallest multiple of 5 greater than 4).
     - Output: `5`

   - For the third test case:
     - `1 1 1 1 1`
     - `start_year` starts at 0.
     - After the first sign: `start_year = 1` (1 is the smallest multiple of 1 greater than 0).
     - After the second sign: `start_year = 2` (2 is the smallest multiple of 1 greater than 1).
     - After the third sign: `start_year = 3` (3 is the smallest multiple of 1 greater than 2).
     - After the fourth sign: `start_year = 4` (4 is the smallest multiple of 1 greater than 3).
     - After the fifth sign: `start_year = 5` (5 is the smallest multiple of 1 greater than 4).
     - Output: `5`

   - For the fourth test case:
     - `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
     - `start_year` starts at 0.
     - After the first sign: `start_year = 50` (50 is the smallest multiple of 50 greater than 0).
     - After the second sign: `start_year = 60` (60 is the smallest multiple of 30 greater than 50).
     - After the third sign: `start_year = 711` (711 is the smallest multiple of 711 greater than 60).
     - After the fourth sign: `start_year = 800` (800 is the smallest multiple of 200 greater than 711).
     - After the fifth sign: `start_year = 1006` (1006 is the smallest multiple of 503 greater than 800).
     - After the sixth sign: `start_year = 2012` (2012 is the smallest multiple of 1006 greater than 1006).
     - Output: `2012`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs sequentially and strictly after the previous sign. The provided examples are also correctly handled by the program.
