Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is an integer such that 0 <= num_tests < initial `num_tests`**. 

The value of `num_tests` is decreased by 1, but the values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged. The new value of `num_tests` is one less than its initial value, and it must now be greater than or equal to 0.
