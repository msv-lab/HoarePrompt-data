Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year before the first sign occurs.
3. **Loop Through Signs**: It iterates through each sign's periodicity (`nums` list) and calculates the next year in which the sign will occur, ensuring that it is strictly after the previous sign.
4. **Calculation**: The expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that the next occurrence of the sign is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.
5. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, it prints the year in which the last sign occurs.

This logic correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs and ensures that the year for the next sign is always greater than the year of the previous sign. The program will produce the correct output for the given example and other valid inputs.
