### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given that the i-th sign occurs every \(a_i\) years and must occur strictly after the (i-1)-th sign.
   - The key is to determine the first year in which each sign occurs after the previous sign has occurred.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs \(n\) and the list of periodicities \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\).

3. **Algorithm:**
   - The program initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year just before the first sign occurs.
   - For each sign \(a_i\), it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur after the previous sign has occurred.
   - The formula used is `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`:
     - `start_year // nums[x]` gives the number of times the current sign has already occurred by `start_year`.
     - Adding 1 to this quotient ensures that the next occurrence is strictly after `start_year`.
     - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the exact year of the next occurrence.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final `start_year`, which is the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1:**
     - \(a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]\)
     - Start with `start_year = 0`.
     - First sign: `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
     - Second sign: `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
     - Third sign: `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
     - Fourth sign: `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
     - Fifth sign: `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
     - Sixth sign: `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
     - Output: 36 (Correct)
   - **Example 2:**
     - \(a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\)
     - Start with `start_year = 0`.
     - First sign: `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
     - Second sign: `start_year = (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
     - Third sign: `start_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
     - Fourth sign: `start_year = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
     - Fifth sign: `start_year = (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
     - Output: 5 (Correct)
   - **Example 3:**
     - \(a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\)
     - Start with `start_year = 0`.
     - First sign: `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
     - Second sign: `start_year = (1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
     - Third sign: `start_year = (2 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3`
     - Fourth sign: `start_year = (3 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`
     - Fifth sign: `start_year = (4 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5`
     - Output: 5 (Correct)
   - **Example 4:**
     - \(a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]\)
     - Start with `start_year = 0`.
     - First sign: `start_year = (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
     - Second sign: `start_year = (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
     - Third sign: `start_year = (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
     - Fourth sign: `start_year = (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 800`
     - Fifth sign: `start_year = (800 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
     - Sixth sign: `start_year = (1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
     - Output: 2012 (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the program.
