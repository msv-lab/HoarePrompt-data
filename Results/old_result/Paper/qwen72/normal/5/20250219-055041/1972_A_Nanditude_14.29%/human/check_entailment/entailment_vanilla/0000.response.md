### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the array `a` of current problem difficulties, and the array `b` of expected problem difficulties.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of new problems proposed.
   - It also initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to iterate through the arrays `a` and `b`.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The program uses a while loop to iterate through the arrays `a` and `b` until either `i` or `j` reaches `n`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current expected difficulty `b[j]` is less than the current actual difficulty `a[i]`.
   - If `b[j] < a[i]`, it means the current problem is too difficult and needs to be replaced:
     - The program removes the last element from `a` using `a.pop(-1)`.
     - It then inserts `b[j]` into the array `a` at the correct position to maintain the non-decreasing order. This is done by slicing the array `a` and inserting `b[j]` at position `i`.
     - The counter `cnt` is incremented to reflect the new problem proposed.
     - The pointer `j` is incremented to move to the next expected difficulty.
   - If `b[j] >= a[i]`, it means the current problem is within the expected difficulty, so both pointers `i` and `j` are incremented.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the counter `cnt`, which represents the minimum number of new problems needed to make `a_i <= b_i` for all `i`.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined but not used in the program. It sorts an array in descending order, which is not relevant to the problem.

### Analysis of the Program:

- The program correctly identifies when a problem in `a` is too difficult compared to the corresponding expected difficulty in `b`.
- It then replaces the most difficult problem in `a` with the new problem of difficulty `b[j]` and maintains the non-decreasing order of `a`.
- The program ensures that the number of new problems proposed is minimized by always replacing the most difficult problem in `a` with the next expected difficulty from `b`.

### Issues:

- **Insertion Logic:**
  - The insertion logic `a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]` is correct but inefficient. It involves creating new lists and concatenating them, which can be costly in terms of time complexity.
  - A more efficient approach would be to use a binary search to find the correct position for `b[j]` and then insert it, but the current logic is still correct.

- **Unnecessary Function:**
  - The function `func_1` is not used and can be removed to clean up the code.

### Conclusion:

The program is logically correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem. However, it can be optimized for better performance, especially for larger inputs.

### Correctness:
