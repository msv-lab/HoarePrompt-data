The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list containing two sublists. The first sublist represents an array `a` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) with elements (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), and the second sublist represents an array `b` of length `n` (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9). Both `a` and `b` are sorted in non-decreasing order. The function returns a list containing the two sublists from `arr`, but in reverse order, meaning the second sublist `b` comes first, followed by the first sublist `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` containing two sorted sublists `a` and `b`, and returns a new list with the sublists in reverse order, where `b` is the first sublist and `a` is the second sublist.**
