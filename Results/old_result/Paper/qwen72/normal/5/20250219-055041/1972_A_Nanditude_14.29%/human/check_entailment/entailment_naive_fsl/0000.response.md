Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the arrays `a` and `b` are such that the difficulties in `a` are already less than or equal to the corresponding difficulties in `b`, but the program still performs unnecessary operations. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4 5 6
```

In this case, the difficulties in `a` are already less than or equal to the corresponding difficulties in `b`, so no new problems should be proposed. However, the program will still perform operations and return an incorrect count of new problems. The program should return `0` for this case, but it will return a non-zero value.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the difficulties in `a` are not in the correct order after inserting a new difficulty. The problem description requires that the array `a` remains sorted in non-decreasing order after each insertion and deletion, but the program does not ensure this. For instance, consider the following input:

```
1
6
1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
```

The program will insert `800` and `1800` into `a`, but it does not sort `a` after each insertion, which can lead to incorrect results. The correct approach would be to insert the new difficulty in the appropriate position to maintain the sorted order, or to sort the array after each insertion.
