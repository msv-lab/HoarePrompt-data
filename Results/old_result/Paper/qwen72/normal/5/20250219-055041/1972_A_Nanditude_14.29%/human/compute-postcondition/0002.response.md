Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` containing two sublists, `a` and `b`, both of which are sorted in non-decreasing order. It returns a new list where the sublists are sorted in reverse order, meaning the sublist `b` will come first, followed by the sublist `a`. The elements within each sublist remain in their original order. **
