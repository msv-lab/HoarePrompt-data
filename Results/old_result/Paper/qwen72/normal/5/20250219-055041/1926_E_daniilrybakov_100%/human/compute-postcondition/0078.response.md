Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `(n // 4) // 2` and must be at least 4, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `n //= 2`, which means `n` is now `n // 2`.
- Since `n` was initially `(n // 4)`, after the update, `n` becomes `(n // 4) // 2`.
- The condition that `n` must be at least 4 remains valid.
- The values of `t`, `k`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- The value of `x` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`, but since `n` has changed, `x` is now based on the new value of `n`.
