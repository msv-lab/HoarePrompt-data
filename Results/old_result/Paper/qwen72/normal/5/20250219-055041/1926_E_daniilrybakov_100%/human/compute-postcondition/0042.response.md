Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is equal to `n // 2` and must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `x`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

The value of `x` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `x` was already `(n + 1) // 2`, so the value of `x` remains the same after the code execution. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions, with no changes to the variables.
