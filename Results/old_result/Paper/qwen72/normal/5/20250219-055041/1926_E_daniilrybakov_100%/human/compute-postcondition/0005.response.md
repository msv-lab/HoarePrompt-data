The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is truthy (i.e., not 0), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` and `k` are input integers, and `n` being an input integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is not 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers and `n` must be non-zero, `s` is 0, `m` is 1**
