Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of all `(n + 1) // 2` values before `n` became 0, `m` is \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\), `x` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0.** 

In natural language, this means:
- `t` is still greater than 0 but has been decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.
- `n` has been repeatedly divided by 2 until it became 0.
- `k` remains unchanged as it was an input integer.
- `s` is the cumulative sum of all the values of `(n + 1) // 2` calculated during the loop before `n` reached 0.
- `m` is the power of 2 corresponding to the number of iterations the loop went through.
- `x` holds the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0.
