The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is expected to accept two parameters, `n` and `k`. These parameters are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the function is likely to be called multiple times with different values of `n` and `k`, where the number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. The function returns a value that is determined by the relationship between `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and returns a value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, with the number of test cases `t` being an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.**
