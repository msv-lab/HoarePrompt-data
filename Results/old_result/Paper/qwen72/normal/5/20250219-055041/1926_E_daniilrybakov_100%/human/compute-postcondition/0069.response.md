The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is `(n // 2)`, which means `n` has been halved and rounded down. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be non-zero after this operation.

Given that `n` is `(n // 2)` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `n` must have been at least 2 before the division (since 1 // 2 = 0, which would terminate the loop). Therefore, `n` must be at least 1 after the division to ensure the loop can proceed.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `(n // 2)` and must be at least 1, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `x`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
