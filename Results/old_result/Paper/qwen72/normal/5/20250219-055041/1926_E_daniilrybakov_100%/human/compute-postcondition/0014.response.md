Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers with `n` being non-zero, `s` is now `x`, `m` is 2, `x` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, and `n` is now `n // 2` and must be non-zero**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The value of `n` is updated to `n // 2`, and it must remain non-zero.
- The other variables (`t`, `k`, `s`, `m`) are not affected and retain their initial values or conditions.
