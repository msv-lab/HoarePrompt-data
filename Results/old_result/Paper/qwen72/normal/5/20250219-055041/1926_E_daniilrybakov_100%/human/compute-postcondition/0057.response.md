The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0 after the decrement.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of all `(n + 1) // 2` values before `n` became 0, `m` is \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\), `x` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0.**

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` has been decremented by 1, it must have been at least 1 at the end of the previous iteration to still be greater than 0 now.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of all `(n + 1) // 2` values before `n` became 0, `m` is \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\), `x` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` became 0.**
