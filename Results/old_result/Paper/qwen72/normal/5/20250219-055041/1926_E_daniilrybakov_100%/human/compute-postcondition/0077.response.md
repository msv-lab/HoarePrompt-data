Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `(n // 4)` and must be at least 4, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `x` is calculated based on the current value of `n`.
- The initial state information for `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `m` is still valid.
