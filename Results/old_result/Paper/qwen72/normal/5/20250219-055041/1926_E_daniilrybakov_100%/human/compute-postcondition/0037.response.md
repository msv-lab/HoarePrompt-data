Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is equal to `n // 2` (where `n` is the original input integer and must be non-zero), `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2` (where `n` is the original value before the division), and `k` is greater than `s` and less than or equal to `s + x`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
