The only variables in the loop head are `qi` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `qi` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, and `qi` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `qi` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than `qi`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `qi` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers, `ans` is equal to `m // a + m // b + 2`**
