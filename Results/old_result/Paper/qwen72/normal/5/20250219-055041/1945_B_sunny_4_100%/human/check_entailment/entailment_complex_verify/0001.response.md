### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have two installations that launch fireworks at intervals of `a` and `b` minutes, respectively.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
   - We need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - A firework launched at time `x` will be visible from `x` to `x + m` inclusive.
   - If a firework from the first installation is launched at time `x`, it will be visible from `x` to `x + m`.
   - If a firework from the second installation is launched at time `y`, it will be visible from `y` to `y + m`.

3. **Simultaneous Visibility:**
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the overlap of the visibility periods.
   - The maximum number of fireworks visible at any given minute is the sum of the number of fireworks launched by both installations within the visibility window of `m + 1` minutes, plus any additional fireworks that might be visible due to the overlap.

4. **Calculating the Number of Fireworks:**
   - The number of fireworks launched by the first installation within `m + 1` minutes is `m // a + 1`.
   - The number of fireworks launched by the second installation within `m + 1` minutes is `m // b + 1`.
   - The total number of fireworks visible at any given minute is the sum of these two values.

5. **Handling Overlap:**
   - The provided solution does not explicitly handle the overlap of visibility periods. However, the problem's constraints and the nature of the intervals suggest that the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given minute is simply the sum of the number of fireworks launched by both installations within the visibility window, plus any additional fireworks that might be visible due to the overlap.
   - The solution adds 2 to the sum of `m // a + m // b` to account for the possibility of overlap.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `a` and `b` are both 1, the installations will launch fireworks every minute, and the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given minute will be `m + 2`.
   - The solution correctly handles this case by adding 2 to the sum of `m // a + m // b`.

7. **General Case:**
   - For other values of `a` and `b`, the solution correctly calculates the number of fireworks launched within the visibility window and adds 2 to account for the overlap.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:
- The annotated code confirms that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \le a, b, m \le 10^{18}\).
- The function `func` reads `t` test cases and for each test case, it reads `a`, `b`, and `m`.
- The calculation `ans = m // a + m // b + 2` is performed for each test case.
- The function prints `ans` for each test case.

### Evaluation of the Calculation:
- The calculation `m // a + m // b + 2` is intended to account for the number of fireworks launched by both installations within the visibility window of `m + 1` minutes, plus an additional 2 to handle potential overlap.
- However, this calculation is incorrect. The correct calculation should be:
  - The number of fireworks launched by the first installation within `m + 1` minutes is `m // a + 1`.
  - The number of fireworks launched by the second installation within `m + 1` minutes is `m // b + 1`.
  - The maximum number of fireworks visible at any given minute is the sum of these two values, plus the number of overlapping fireworks.

### Correct Calculation:
- The correct formula to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is:
  \[
  \text{max\_visible} = \left(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + 1\right) + \left(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 1\right) - \left(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{\text{lcm}(a, b)} \right\rfloor + 1\right)
  \]
  where \(\text{lcm}(a, b)\) is the least common multiple of `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not account for the overlap of visibility periods correctly. The addition of 2 is not a valid way to handle the overlap. The correct approach should use the least common multiple to determine the number of overlapping fireworks.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
