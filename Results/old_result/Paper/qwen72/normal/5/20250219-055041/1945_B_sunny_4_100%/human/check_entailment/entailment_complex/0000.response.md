### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have two installations that launch fireworks at intervals of `a` and `b` minutes, respectively.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.
   - We need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - It calculates the value `ans` as `m // a + m // b + 2`.
   - It prints `ans` for each test case.

3. **Correctness of the Calculation:**
   - The calculation `m // a` gives the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the first `m` minutes.
   - The calculation `m // b` gives the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the first `m` minutes.
   - Adding 2 to the sum of these two values is incorrect. The +2 should not be there because it does not account for the visibility overlap correctly.

4. **Correct Calculation:**
   - The correct calculation should consider the visibility overlap of the fireworks.
   - The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility window of `m + 1` minutes.
   - We need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine if there are any overlaps in the launches.

5. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input `6 7 4`:
     - The first installation launches fireworks at times 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, 96, 102, 108, 114, 120, ...
     - The second installation launches fireworks at times 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112, 119, 126, ...
     - The visibility window is 5 minutes (from `x` to `x + 4`).
     - The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2, which occurs at times 7 and 42.

   - For the input `7 8 56`:
     - The first installation launches fireworks at times 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112, 119, ...
     - The second installation launches fireworks at times 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112, 120, ...
     - The visibility window is 57 minutes (from `x` to `x + 56`).
     - The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 17, which occurs at times 56 and 112.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program's current calculation `m // a + m // b + 2` is incorrect because it does not properly account for the visibility overlap.
   - The correct calculation should be `m // a + m // b + 1` if `a` and `b` are not equal, and `m // a + 1` if `a` and `b` are equal.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it adds an extra 2 to the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation, which does not accurately reflect the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. The correct calculation should be `m // a + m // b + 1` if `a` and `b` are not equal, and `m // a + 1` if `a` and `b` are equal.
