Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the logic used to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

The program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility time `m` and then adds 2 to the result. However, this approach does not account for the overlap in visibility times of fireworks launched by the two installations.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to consider the following:
1. Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility time `m`.
2. Determine the maximum overlap in visibility times between the fireworks launched by the two installations.

The correct approach would involve finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the overlap and then calculating the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility time m
        count_a = (m + a) // a
        count_b = (m + b) // b
        # Calculate the LCM of a and b to find the overlap
        l = lcm(a, b)
        # Calculate the number of overlaps within the visibility time m
        overlaps = (m + l) // l
        # The maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is the sum of the counts minus the overlaps plus 1
        max_visible = count_a + count_b - overlaps + 1
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly accounts for the overlap in visibility times and provides the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
