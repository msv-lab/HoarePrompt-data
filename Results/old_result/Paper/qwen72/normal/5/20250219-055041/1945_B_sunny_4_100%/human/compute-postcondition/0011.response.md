Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `qi` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers, `ans` is equal to `m // a + m // b + 2`**

Explanation:
- The values of `t` and `qi` remain unchanged.
- The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` are now assigned the values of the input integers provided by the user.
- The value of `ans` is still calculated as `m // a + m // b + 2`, using the new values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
