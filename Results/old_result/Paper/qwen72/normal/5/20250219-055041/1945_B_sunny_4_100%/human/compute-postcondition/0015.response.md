The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `m` where 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18, and the total number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The function is expected to return a result for each test case, but the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints. 

Given the typical structure of such functions, it is reasonable to infer that the function might return a list or a collection of results, one for each test case, or it might print the results directly. However, without the specific output details, the exact nature of the return value cannot be determined.

Functionality: **The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), with the total number of test cases `t` being a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4).
