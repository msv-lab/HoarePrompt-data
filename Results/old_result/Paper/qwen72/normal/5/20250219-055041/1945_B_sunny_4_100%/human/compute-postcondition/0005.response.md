Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `qi` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers.
- `ans` is equal to `m // a + m // b + 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Variables**:
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided as input.
   - The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not explicitly given, so we need to consider their general properties.

2. **Calculation of `ans`**:
   - `m // a` is the integer division of `m` by `a`, which gives the quotient (the largest integer less than or equal to the division result).
   - `m // b` is the integer division of `m` by `b`, which gives the quotient.
   - `ans` is the sum of these two quotients plus 2.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`.

### Final Output:
The value of `ans` is calculated as `m // a + m // b + 2`, where `m`, `a`, and `b` are input integers.
Output: **m // a + m // b + 2 (where m, a, and b are input integers)**
