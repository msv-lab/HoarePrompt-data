Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary as described, `cur` is 0, `i` is 0, and if `M[0]` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains greater than 0.***
