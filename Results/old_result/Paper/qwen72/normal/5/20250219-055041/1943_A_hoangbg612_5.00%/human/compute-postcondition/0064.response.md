Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cur` is -1, `num` is the first element in `N`, and `num` is greater than `cur`. If `num` > `cur + 1`, `cur` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
