Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and 1 as the value, `cur` is the first element in `N`, `num` is the first element in `N`, and the current value of `num` is greater than -1. If `num` > `cur` + 1, `cur` is set to 0 and `num` is greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is the first element in `N` and `num` is greater than -1.**
