The only objects in the loop head are `num` and the list `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N`. If `N` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `num` will take the value of the first element in `N` at the start of the loop.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cur` is -1, `num` is the first element in `N`**
