Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, and `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in `N` that are not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears consecutively in `N`. If the sum of the values in `M` is equal to `S`, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, incremented by 1. If `N` contains no such integers, `cur` is 0, and `M` is a dictionary with -1 as the key and the count of all elements in `N` as its value. Otherwise, `cur` remains the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, and `M` is unchanged.***
