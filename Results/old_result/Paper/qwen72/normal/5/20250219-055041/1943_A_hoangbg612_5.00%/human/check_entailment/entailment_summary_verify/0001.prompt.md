You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        cur = -1
        M = {}
        for num in N:
            if num > cur:
                if num > cur + 1:
                    cur += 1
                    break
                cur = num
                M[cur] = 1
            else:
                M[cur] += 1
        if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
            cur += 1
        for i in range(cur):
            if M[i] <= i:
                cur = i
                break
        print(cur)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `S` and a list of `S` integers. It sorts the list and then constructs a dictionary `M` where each key is an integer from the list that is exactly one more than the previous integer, and the value is the count of consecutive integers equal to the key. The function then determines the smallest index `cur` such that the count of integers up to `cur` in `M` is less than or equal to `cur`. If no such index exists, `cur` is the largest integer in the list plus one. The function prints `cur` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually. This is in line with the problem statement.

2. **Sorting the Array**: The program sorts the array `N`. This is a good approach because the MEX of an array is determined by the smallest missing non-negative integer, and sorting helps in identifying the sequence of numbers more easily.

3. **Tracking the Current MEX**: The variable `cur` is used to track the current MEX. It is initialized to -1, which is appropriate because we start checking from 0.

4. **Building the Frequency Dictionary**: The program uses a dictionary `M` to keep track of the frequency of each number in the sorted array. This is useful for determining how many times each number appears.

5. **Updating the Current MEX**: The program iterates through the sorted array and updates `cur` to the current number if it is greater than the previous `cur`. If the current number is greater than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks out of the loop. This is because the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is missing, and if the current number is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur + 1` is the MEX.

6. **Checking the Total Frequency**: The program checks if the sum of the frequencies in the dictionary `M` equals the size of the array `S`. If it does, it increments `cur` by 1. This step is unnecessary and incorrect. The MEX should be determined by the smallest missing integer, not by the total frequency.

7. **Final MEX Calculation**: The program iterates through the range from 0 to `cur` and checks if the frequency of the current number `i` is less than or equal to `i`. If it is, it sets `cur` to `i` and breaks out of the loop. This step is also incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest integer that is not in the array, not based on the frequency of the numbers.

8. **Output**: The program prints the final value of `cur` for each test case. This is the correct output format.

However, the logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The correct approach should be to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c` after all elements have been processed. The program's current logic does not correctly handle this.

Correctness: **False**

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        cur = 0
        for num in N:
            if num == cur:
                cur += 1
            elif num > cur:
                break
        print(cur)
```

This corrected version correctly determines the MEX by iterating through the sorted array and finding the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array.
