Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in `N` (if any), and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears consecutively in `N` up to the point where `num` > `cur + 1` or the end of the list is reached, `cur` is the last integer in `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in `N` (if any).**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `T` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `_` remains 1.
- The variable `S` remains the input integer.
- The variable `N` remains the sorted list of integers provided by the user.
- The dictionary `M` will contain keys that are integers from `N` which are exactly one more than the previous integer in `N` (if any), and the values will be the count of how many times each of these integers appears consecutively in `N` up to the point where `num` is more than `cur + 1` or the end of the list is reached.
- The variable `cur` will be the last integer in `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in `N` (if any). If the loop breaks early because `num` > `cur + 1`, `cur` will be the integer just before the break. If the loop completes without breaking, `cur` will be the last element in `N`.
