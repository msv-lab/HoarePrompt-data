To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `cur`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `cur`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `T` is greater than 0
- `_` is 1
- `S` is an input integer
- `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user
- `M` is a dictionary as described
- `cur` is 0
- `i` is 0

Let's analyze the loop head:
```python
for i in range(cur):
    # the loop body is omit
```

1. **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. Since this is a `for` loop, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
2. **`cur`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `cur` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `cur`. However, since `cur` is 0, the loop will not execute again unless `cur` is increased.

Since `cur` is 0, the loop will not execute again unless `cur` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `cur` must be at least 1, and `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary as described, `cur` is 1, `i` is 1**
