Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list `N`. If `num` > `cur + 1`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged and the program continues execution.***
