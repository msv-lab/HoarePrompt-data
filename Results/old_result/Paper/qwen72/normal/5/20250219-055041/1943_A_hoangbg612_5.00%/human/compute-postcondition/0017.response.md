Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `num` is the first element in `N`. If `num` > -1, `cur` is updated to `num`, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and 1 as its value, and if `num` > `cur` + 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num` <= -1, `cur` remains -1, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` (-1) as a key and its value incremented by 1.**
