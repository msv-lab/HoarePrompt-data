To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `cur`. The loop will execute if `cur` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment up to `cur - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is greater than 0
- `_` is 1
- `S` is an input integer
- `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user
- `M` is a dictionary as described
- `cur` is the last integer in `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in `N` (if any)

The loop will execute if `cur` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is not explicitly initialized, but it will be set to 0 by the `for` loop itself.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `cur` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary as described, `cur` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
