Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and its value is 0 (since `cur` was -1 and `M` was initially empty, `M[cur]` would raise a KeyError, so it is initialized to 0 and then incremented by 1), `cur` is -1, `num` is the first element in `N`, and `num` is less than or equal to `cur`.**
