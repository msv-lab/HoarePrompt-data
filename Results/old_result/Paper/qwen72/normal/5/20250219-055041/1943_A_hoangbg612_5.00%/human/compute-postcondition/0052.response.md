Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `T` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `S` is an input integer.
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
   - `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in `N` that are not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears consecutively in `N`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print(cur)` statement.
   - `cur` is set based on the conditions described in the initial state.

3. **Determining the Value of `cur`:**
   - If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `cur` is set to the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, incremented by 1.
   - If the loop breaks, `cur` is set to the first integer `i` where `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.

4. **Analyzing the Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates through the list `N` and checks the conditions for setting `cur`.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, it means that all integers in `N` are either equal to or greater than the previous integer by exactly 1. In this case, `cur` will be the largest integer in `N` plus 1.
   - If the loop breaks, it means that there is an integer `i` in `N` where `M[i]` (the count of `i` in `N`) is less than or equal to `i`. In this case, `cur` will be set to this integer `i`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `cur` will be either the largest integer in `N` plus 1 (if the loop completes without breaking) or the first integer `i` where `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i` (if the loop breaks).

Since the exact values of `N` and `M` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **cur (where cur is either the largest integer in N plus 1 if the loop completes without breaking, or the first integer i where M[i] is less than or equal to i if the loop breaks)**
