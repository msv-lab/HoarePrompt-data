Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `M` is a dictionary, `num` is the third element in `N`, `cur` is the second element in `N` if `num` > `cur` + 1, otherwise `cur` is incremented by 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
