The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N`. If `N` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, and `cur` is -1. These states do not directly affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to execute, `N` must have at least one element, and `num` will be the first element of `N`.

State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cur` is -1, `num` is the first element in `N`**
