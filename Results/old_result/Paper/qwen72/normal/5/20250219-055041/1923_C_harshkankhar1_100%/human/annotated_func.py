#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `q` are integers representing the length of the array `c` and the number of queries (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `queries` is a list of q pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `a` is a list where the first element is 0, and the subsequent elements are integers provided by the input, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `c` and must be greater than 0, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries and is now the second integer from the input, `c` is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), `queries` is a list of q pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is `n`, `x` is 1 if `a[n]` > 1 else `x` is 2, `b[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n` is `b[i-1] + 1` if `a[i]` > 1 else `b[i]` is `b[i-1] + 2`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `a` is a list of cumulative sums, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (n > 0), `q` is 0, `c` is a list of integers (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), `queries` is a list of q pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` and `y` are input integers, and either 'NO' or 'YES' has been printed for each query based on the conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of queries on an array `c`. It reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q` from input, followed by the elements of the array `c`. It then constructs a prefix sum array `a` and another prefix sum array `b` based on the elements of `c`. For each query, it reads a pair of indices `(x, y)` and prints 'YES' if the sum of elements in `c` from index `x` to `y` is at least the corresponding sum in `b` and `x` is not equal to `y`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input arrays and variables are consumed, and the results of the queries are printed to the console.
