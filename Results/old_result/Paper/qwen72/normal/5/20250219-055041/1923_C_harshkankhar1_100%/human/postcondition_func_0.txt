The function `func_1` processes a series of queries on an array `c`. It reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q` from input, followed by the elements of the array `c`. It then constructs a prefix sum array `a` and another prefix sum array `b` based on the elements of `c`. For each query, it reads a pair of indices `(x, y)` and prints 'YES' if the sum of elements in `c` from index `x` to `y` is at least the corresponding sum in `b` and `x` is not equal to `y`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input arrays and variables are consumed, and the results of the queries are printed to the console.
