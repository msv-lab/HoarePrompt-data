Output State: **`a` is a list of cumulative sums, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (n > 0), `q` is 0, `c` is a list of integers (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), `queries` is a list of q pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` and `y` are input integers, and either 'NO' or 'YES' has been printed for each query based on the conditions.**

Natural Language Description:
- The list `a` remains a list of cumulative sums of the elements from the initial `a` list.
- The integer `t` remains within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The integer `n` remains greater than 0.
- The integer `q` is now 0, indicating that all queries have been processed.
- The list `c` remains a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9.
- The list `queries` remains a list of pairs of integers, where each pair represents a query.
- The list `b` remains a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, but its values have been updated based on the conditions in the loop.
- The integer `i` remains `n + 1`.
- The integers `x` and `y` are input integers for each query.
- For each query, the loop has printed either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
