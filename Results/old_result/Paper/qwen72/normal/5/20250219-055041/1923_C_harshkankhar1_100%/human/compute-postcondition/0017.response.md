The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a counter for the number of iterations. The loop iterates `q` times, and the state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that the loop has already run `n` times. However, since the loop is defined to run `q` times, and `q` is greater than 0, the loop can still execute if `n` is less than `q`.

Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly tracked in the state, we can infer that for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `n` should be incremented by 1 to reflect the next iteration. However, the loop counter itself is not part of the state we need to adjust, as it is handled implicitly by the `for` loop.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect that the loop is about to start its next iteration, which means `n` should be `n + 1` (or `i` should be `n + 1` if `i` is used as the loop counter).

State: **`a` is a list of cumulative sums, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (n > 0), `q` is an integer (q > 0), `c` is a list of integers (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), `queries` is a list of q pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is 1 if the last element in `a` was greater than 1 else `x` is 2, `y` is an input integer, 'NO' or 'YES' is printed based on the conditions.**
