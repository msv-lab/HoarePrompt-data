Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 4, `_` is 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 4, and `j` remains 0 unless `l[4] == 6` and `l[5] == 5`, in which case `j` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
