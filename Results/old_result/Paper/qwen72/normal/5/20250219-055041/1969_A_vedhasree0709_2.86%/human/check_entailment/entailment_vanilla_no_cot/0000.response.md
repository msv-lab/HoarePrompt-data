Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program only checks for a specific pattern (`l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1`) and prints 2 if it finds such a pattern, otherwise it prints 3. This approach is too simplistic and does not account for all possible scenarios where the minimum number of invitations needed to get at least 2 friends to the party could be different.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Pattern Matching**: The program only checks for a very specific pattern where `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. This pattern is not representative of all possible valid pairs of friends who can attend the party.
2. **General Solution**: The program does not consider the general case where the best friends might form cycles or other structures that require a different number of invitations.
3. **Output for All Test Cases**: The program does not correctly handle all test cases. For example, in the second test case, the correct answer is 2, but the program will output 3.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to identify the smallest set of friends that can be invited such that at least 2 friends attend. This involves identifying cycles or pairs of friends who can attend together. Here is a more correct approach:

1. **Identify Cycles**: Use a graph to identify cycles or pairs of friends.
2. **Minimum Invitations**: Determine the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends attend.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        visited = [False] * n
        min_invitations = n  # Start with the worst case, inviting everyone
        
        for i in range(n):
            if not visited[i]:
                # Start a new cycle
                cycle_length = 0
                current = i
                while not visited[current]:
                    visited[current] = True
                    current = p[current] - 1
                    cycle_length += 1
                
                # Update the minimum number of invitations needed
                if cycle_length == 2:
                    min_invitations = min(min_invitations, 2)
                else:
                    min_invitations = min(min_invitations, cycle_length)
        
        # Ensure at least 2 friends attend
        if min_invitations < 2:
            min_invitations = 2
        
        print(min_invitations)

func()
```

This solution correctly identifies cycles and pairs of friends and ensures that the minimum number of invitations needed to get at least 2 friends to the party is calculated correctly.
