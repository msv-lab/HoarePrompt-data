The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` is mentioned in the state but is not directly used in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, the value of `t` should be consistent with the number of test cases that the loop is expected to handle.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
