Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `i` is 1, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is 1.**

The value of `j` is now 1, regardless of the initial conditions of the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
