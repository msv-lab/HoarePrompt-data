The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `l`.

- `l` is now a list of integers provided by the user.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `_`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0 if there does not exist an index `i` such that `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` in the list `l`. Otherwise, `j` is 1, and `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
