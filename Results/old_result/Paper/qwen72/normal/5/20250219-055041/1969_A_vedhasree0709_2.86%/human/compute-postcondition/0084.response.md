Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `_` is `t`, `i` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user. If any element `l[k]` is `k + 2` and the next element `l[k + 1]` is `k + 1` for any `k` in the range 0 to `n-2`, then `j` is 1 and the program has printed 2 for that test case. Otherwise, `j` remains 0, and the program has printed 3 for that test case.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to `t`, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop has finished processing the list `l`. If the loop found any index `k` in the list `l` such that `l[k]` is `k + 2` and `l[k + 1]` is `k + 1`, then `j` will be 1, and the program will have printed 2 for that test case. If no such index was found, `j` will remain 0, and the program will have printed 3 for that test case. The list `l` and the integer `n` will remain unchanged from their initial values for each test case.
