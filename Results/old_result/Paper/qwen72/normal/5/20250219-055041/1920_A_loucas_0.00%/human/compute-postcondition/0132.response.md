The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `big`, and `less`. The loop can execute again if `i` is within the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `big` is a non-empty list.
- `less` is a non-empty list.
- `max(big) < min(less)`.
- `i` is the first integer in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1 to move to the next integer in the range.
- The range itself (`max(big)` to `min(less)`) must still be valid, meaning `max(big) < min(less)` must still hold true.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is the next integer in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`.
- `big` and `less` remain non-empty lists with `max(big) < min(less)`.

State: **`big` is a non-empty list, `less` is a non-empty list, `max(big) < min(less)`, and `i` is the next integer in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`.**
