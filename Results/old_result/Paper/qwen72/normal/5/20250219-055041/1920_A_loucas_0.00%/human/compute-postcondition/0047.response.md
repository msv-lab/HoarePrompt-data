Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- The loop will execute until it finds the first value of `i` that is not in `no` and is within the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1`.
- If such a value is found, `num` will be set to this value, and the loop will terminate.
- If no such value is found, `num` will remain unchanged, and the loop will complete all iterations.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(num)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Range of `i`**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1`.
   - This means `i` will take values starting from the maximum value in the list `big` and ending at the minimum value in the list `less` minus 1.

2. **Condition for `i`**:
   - The loop checks if `i` is not in the list `no`.
   - If `i` is not in `no`, `num` is set to this value and the loop terminates.

3. **Behavior of `num`**:
   - If a value of `i` is found that meets the condition, `num` will be set to this value.
   - If no such value is found, `num` will remain unchanged.

4. **Initial Value of `num`**:
   - The initial value of `num` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we assume `num` is either not initialized or initialized to some default value (e.g., `None`).

### Possible Outcomes:
- **If a valid `i` is found**:
  - `num` will be set to the first value of `i` that is not in `no` and is within the specified range.
  - The `print(num)` statement will output this value.

- **If no valid `i` is found**:
  - `num` will remain unchanged.
  - If `num` was not initialized, it will be `None`.
  - If `num` was initialized to some value, it will retain that value.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `big`, `less`, and `no` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `num`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `num` after the loop has executed.

Output: **num (where num is the first value of i that is not in no and is within the range from max(big) to min(less) - 1, or num remains unchanged if no such value is found)**
