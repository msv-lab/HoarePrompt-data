Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin and write output to stdout. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains a single integer `loop` (1 ≤ `loop` ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a single integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, followed by `n` lines, each containing two integers `a` (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}) and `x` (1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^9), where `a` denotes the type of constraint and `x` is the value associated with the constraint. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.
Code of the loop:
for iterable in range(loop):
    less = []
    big = []
    no = []
    num = 0
    innerLoop = int(input())
    for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
        x, a = map(int, input().split())
        if x == 1:
            big.append(a)
        elif x == 2:
            less.append(a)
        else:
            no.append(a)
    for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
        if i not in no:
            num = i
            break
    print(num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop will execute until it finds the first value of `i` that is not in `no` and is within the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1`. If such a value is found, `num` will be set to this value, and the loop will terminate. If no such value is found, `num` will remain unchanged, and the loop will complete all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `loop` must be greater than `iterable + 1`, `num` is the first value in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `big` is a non-empty list containing all the values of `a` where `x` is 1, `less` is a non-empty list containing all the values of `a` where `x` is 2, `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` is the first value in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`, `no` is a list containing all the values of `a` where `x` is not 1 or 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `big` is a non-empty list, `less` is a non-empty list, `max(big) < min(less)`, and `i` is the first integer in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`. If such an integer exists, `num` is set to `i`. If no such integer exists, `num` remains 0. `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`, and `iterable` is `iterable + innerLoop`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
