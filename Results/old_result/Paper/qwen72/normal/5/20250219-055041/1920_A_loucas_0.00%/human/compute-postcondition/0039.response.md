Output State: **`big` must contain at least one element, `less` must contain at least one element, `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` is `max(big) + 1`, `num` is `max(big) + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `num` is assigned the value of `i`, which is `max(big) + 1`. The initial conditions for `big` and `less` remain unchanged.
