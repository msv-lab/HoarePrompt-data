Let's break down the initial state and determine the value of `num`:

1. **`big` and `less`**:
   - `big` is a non-empty list containing all the values of `a` where `x` is 1.
   - `less` is a non-empty list containing all the values of `a` where `x` is 2.
   - It is given that `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`. This means that the largest value in `big` is smaller than the smallest value in `less`.

2. **`no`**:
   - `no` is a list containing all the values of `a` where `x` is not 1 or 2.

3. **`num`**:
   - `num` is the first value in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`.

Given these conditions, let's determine the value of `num`:

- The range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` is a sequence of integers starting from the largest value in `big` and ending at the smallest value in `less`.
- We need to find the first value in this range that is not in `no`.

Since `max(big)` is less than `min(less)`, the range is a valid sequence of integers. The value of `num` will be the first integer in this range that is not in `no`.

Let's assume some example values to illustrate this:
- Suppose `big = [1, 3, 5]` and `less = [7, 9, 11]`.
- Then `max(big) = 5` and `min(less) = 7`.
- The range from 5 to 7 is `[5, 6, 7]`.
- Suppose `no = [4, 6, 8]`.

In this case, the first value in the range `[5, 6, 7]` that is not in `no` is `5`.

Therefore, the value of `num` will be `5` in this example. However, since the exact values of `big`, `less`, and `no` are not provided, we can only describe `num` in terms of the given conditions.

Output: **num (where num is the first value in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`)**
