Postcondition: ***`loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `less` is a list containing `[a]` if `x` is 2; otherwise, `less` is an empty list. `big` is an empty list. `no` is a list containing the value of `a` if `x` is not 2; otherwise, `no` is an empty list. `num` is 0, `iterable2` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and `x` is not equal to 1.***
