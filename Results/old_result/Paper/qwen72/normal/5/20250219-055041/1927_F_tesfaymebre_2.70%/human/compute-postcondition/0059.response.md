Output State: **`colors` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `graph[u]` contains the list `[v, v, ..., v]` with `m` elements, `graph[v]` contains the list `[u, u, ..., u]` with `m` elements, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order by the value of `w`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements, `node_u` and `node_v` are the last nodes that were unioned, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight among all the edges that were unioned, `res` is the result of the `dfs` function called with `node_u`, `-1`, and an empty list.** 

The `dfs` function is called with `node_u` as the starting node, `-1` as the parent node, and an empty list as the path. The result of this function call is stored in the variable `res`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
