Output State: **`u` and `v` are now in the same connected component in `dsu`, `_min_edge` is updated to the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated to the new parent of `u` and `v` as determined by `dsu.find(u)` and `dsu.find(v)` respectively, `node_u` is set to `u`, `node_v` is set to `v`, and `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is updated to `w` if `w` is less than the current `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `node_v = v` does not change any of the initial conditions provided. It simply reassigns `node_v` to `v`, which was already set to `v` in the initial state. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain valid and unchanged.
