Postcondition: ***`u` and `v` are now in the same connected component in `dsu`, `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated to the new parent of `u` and `v` as determined by `dsu.find(u)` and `dsu.find(v)` respectively, `node_u` is set to `u`, `node_v` is set to `v`. If `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`, `_min_edge` is updated to the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`. If `w` is less than the current `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is updated to `w`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.***
