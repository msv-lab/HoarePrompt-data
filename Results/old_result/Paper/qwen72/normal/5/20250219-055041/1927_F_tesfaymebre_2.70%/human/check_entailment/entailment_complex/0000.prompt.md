Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_2():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns the first line of input from the user, with any trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads the first line of input from the user via `sys.stdin`, removes any trailing whitespace from this line, and returns the modified line. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the user will have a string that represents the first line of input they provided, with any trailing whitespace removed.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input and returns a map object containing these integers. After the function concludes, the map object can be iterated over to access the integers.

#Function 4:

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line from standard input, removes any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line into separate strings, converts these strings to integers, and returns a list of these integers.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used. This function is a utility function to read a line from standard input, strip any leading or trailing whitespace, and split the line into a list of strings.

    print(*res)
    #This is printed: [nodes visited in the dfs traversal starting from node_u, including node_u and node_v] (where the exact nodes depend on the graph structure and the implementation of the dfs function)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` initializes an empty graph and an empty list of edges, then populates the graph and edges based on `m` iterations of values provided by `func_3()`. It sorts the edges in descending order by weight, processes them using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure to union nodes and track the minimum edge weight, and finally performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from a specific node to print the minimum edge weight and the number of nodes in the DFS traversal, followed by the nodes themselves. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. The final state of the program includes a populated graph, a sorted list of edges, and the printed results of the minimum edge weight and the DFS traversal nodes.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: curr and parent are integers representing vertices in the graph, and path is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal.

    if (colors[curr] == 1) :
        return path
        #The program returns the list `path` which represents the current path in the DFS traversal.
    #State: `curr` and `parent` are integers representing vertices in the graph, and `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal. Additionally, `colors[curr]` is not equal to 1.
    colors[curr] = 1
    path.append(curr)
    for nei in graph[curr]:
        if colors[nei] != 2 and nei != parent:
            res = dfs(nei, curr, path)
            set_res = set(res)
            if res and node_v in set_res:
                return res
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. `curr` and `parent` remain integers representing vertices in the graph, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal with `curr` appended to it, `colors[curr]` is still 1, and `graph[curr]` has been fully iterated over. If any neighbor `nei` of `curr` (where `nei` is not `parent` and `colors[nei]` is not 2) resulted in a non-empty `res` from the `dfs` function and `node_v` is in `set_res`, the function returns `res`. Otherwise, the function returns an empty list.
    colors[curr] = 2
    return []
    #The program returns an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal in a graph. It accepts three parameters: `curr` (the current vertex), `parent` (the parent vertex in the DFS traversal), and `path` (the current path in the DFS traversal). The function modifies the `colors` and `path` variables. If the current vertex `curr` is already being visited (i.e., `colors[curr]` is 1), it returns the current path. If a valid path is found from a neighbor of `curr` (excluding `parent` and any already fully visited vertices), and this path includes a specific node `node_v`, it returns this path. If no such path is found, it marks the current vertex as fully visited (i.e., `colors[curr]` is 2) and returns an empty list. The final state of the program is that the `colors` and `path` variables are updated, and the function returns either the current path or an empty list.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_7`.
def func_7():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        func_6()
        
    #State: `test_cases` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `func_6()` has been called `test_cases` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves a number of test cases from `func_1` and then calls `func_6` that many times. After the function concludes, `func_6` has been called a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_1`. The function itself does not return any value.
