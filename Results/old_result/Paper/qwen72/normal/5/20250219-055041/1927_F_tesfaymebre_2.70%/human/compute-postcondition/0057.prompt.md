Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `graph[u]` now contains the list `[v, v, ..., v]` with `m` elements, `graph[v]` now contains the list `[u, u, ..., u]` with `m` elements, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order by the value of `w`, `i` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements, `_min_edge` is `inf`, `node_u` is -1, `node_v` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for w, u, v in edges:
    parent_u = dsu.find(u)
    parent_v = dsu.find(v)
    if parent_u == parent_v:
        dsu.union(u, v, w)
        if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
            _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
            node_u = u
            node_v = v
    else:
        dsu.union(u, v, w)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `graph[u]` now contains the list `[v, v, ..., v]` with `m` elements, `graph[v]` now contains the list `[u, u, ..., u]` with `m` elements, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order by the value of `w` and must have at least 1 tuple, `i` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements. If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, `u` and `v` are in the same connected component, `_min_edge` remains `inf`, `node_u` and `node_v` remain -1, and `parent_u` is the same as `parent_v`. Otherwise, `u` and `v` are in different connected components, they are unioned, `node_u` is set to `u`, `node_v` is set to `v`, and if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`, `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`; otherwise, `_min_edge` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `graph[u]` contains the list `[v, v, ..., v]` with `m` elements, `graph[v]` contains the list `[u, u, ..., u]` with `m` elements, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order by the value of `w` and must have at least 2 tuples, `i` is `m-2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` as determined by `dsu.find(u)`, `parent_v` is the parent of `v` as determined by `dsu.find(v)`. If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, `u` and `v` are in the same connected component, `node_u` is set to `u`, `node_v` is set to `v`, and `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`; otherwise, `_min_edge` remains unchanged. If `parent_u` is not equal to `parent_v`, `u` and `v` are in different connected components, they are unioned, `node_u` is set to `u`, `node_v` is set to `v`, and `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`; otherwise, `_min_edge` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `graph[u]` contains the list `[v, v, ..., v]` with `m` elements, `graph[v]` contains the list `[u, u, ..., u]` with `m` elements, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order by the value of `w` and must have at least 3 tuples, `i` is `m-3`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements, `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated to the new parent of `u` and `v` as determined by `dsu.find(u)` and `dsu.find(v)` respectively, `node_u` is set to `u`, `node_v` is set to `v`. If `parent_u == parent_v`, `u` and `v` are in the same connected component, and if `w` is less than the current `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is updated to `w`. If `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`, `_min_edge` is updated to the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`. If `parent_u != parent_v`, `u` and `v` are now in the same connected component, and `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is updated to the minimum of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` and `w`. If `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`, `_min_edge` is updated to the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
