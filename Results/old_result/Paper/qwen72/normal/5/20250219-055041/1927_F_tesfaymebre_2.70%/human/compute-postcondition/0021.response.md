Output State: **`set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`, `curr` and `parent` are integers representing vertices in the graph, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal with `curr` appended to it, `colors[curr]` is 1, `graph[curr]` must have at least three neighbors, `nei` is the third neighbor in `graph[curr]`. If `colors[nei]` is not 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, `res` is the result of the `dfs` function called with `nei` as the current vertex, `curr` as the parent, and the current `path`. If `res` is not empty and `node_v` is in `set_res`, the function returns `res`. Otherwise, the function returns an empty list. If `colors[nei]` is 2 or `nei` is equal to `parent`, `res` remains an empty list and the function returns an empty list.**
