### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The input handling functions (`func_1`, `func_3`, etc.) are correctly implemented to read the input as specified in the problem description.
   - The main function `func_6` reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, constructs the graph, and initializes the list of edges.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The graph is correctly represented using a `defaultdict` of lists, where each key is a vertex and the value is a list of adjacent vertices.
   - The edges are stored in a list of tuples `(w, u, v)`, where `w` is the weight of the edge between vertices `u` and `v`.

3. **Edge Sorting**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight. This is indeed incorrect for the problem's requirements. The edges should be sorted in ascending order to ensure that the lightest edge in a cycle is considered first. This is a critical error that affects the correctness of the program.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - The `DSU` class is correctly implemented with methods `find` and `union` to manage the connected components of the graph.
   - The `min_edge` array in the `DSU` class is used to keep track of the minimum edge weight in each component, which is a good approach for finding the lightest edge in a cycle.

5. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges and uses the `DSU` to check if adding an edge would form a cycle.
   - The condition `if parent_u == parent_v` is used to detect a cycle. However, the edge is added to the component even if it doesn't form a cycle, which is incorrect. The edge should only be added to the component if it forms a cycle.
   - The program updates the minimum edge weight in the cycle correctly when a cycle is detected.

6. **DFS for Cycle**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to find the vertices in the cycle starting from the vertex `node_u`.
   - The function uses a `colors` array to keep track of the visited status of each vertex. A vertex is marked as `1` when it is being visited and `2` when the visit is complete.
   - The function should return the cycle path when a cycle is detected, but the current implementation may return incorrect paths if the cycle detection logic is flawed.

### Issues:
- **Edge Sorting**: The edges are sorted in descending order, which is incorrect. The edges should be sorted in ascending order to find the lightest edge in a cycle.
- **Cycle Detection**: The condition `if parent_u == parent_v` is used to detect a cycle, but the edge should be added to the component only if it forms a cycle. The current implementation adds the edge to the component even if it doesn't form a cycle.
- **DFS**: The `dfs` function is not correctly handling the cycle detection. It should return the cycle path when a cycle is detected, but the current implementation may return incorrect paths.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect. The edge sorting and cycle detection logic need to be fixed to ensure the program finds the correct cycle with the minimal lightest edge.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
