Postcondition: ***`u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `graph[u]` contains the list `[v, v, ..., v]` with `m` elements, `graph[v]` contains the list `[u, u, ..., u]` with `m` elements, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order by the value of `w` and must have at least 3 tuples, `i` is `m-3`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements, `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated to the new parent of `u` and `v` as determined by `dsu.find(u)` and `dsu.find(v)` respectively, `node_u` is set to `u`, `node_v` is set to `v`. If `parent_u == parent_v`, `u` and `v` are in the same connected component, and if `w` is less than the current `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is updated to `w`. If `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`, `_min_edge` is updated to the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`. If `parent_u != parent_v`, `u` and `v` are now in the same connected component, and `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is updated to the minimum of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` and `w`. If `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`, `_min_edge` is updated to the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.***
