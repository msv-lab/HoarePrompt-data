The only objects in the loop head are the variables `w`, `u`, and `v`, and the list `edges`. The loop iterates over the list `edges`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the list `edges` must have at least one more tuple to process. At the end of the last iteration, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order by the value of `w` and must have at least 1 tuple, and `i` is `m-1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple in `edges` will be processed. Since `edges` is sorted in descending order by `w` and `i` is `m-1`, the next tuple will be the one at index `m-2` (i.e., the second-to-last tuple). This means `w`, `u`, and `v` will be updated to the values of the tuple at index `m-2`.

State: **`u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `graph[u]` now contains the list `[v, v, ..., v]` with `m` elements, `graph[v]` now contains the list `[u, u, ..., u]` with `m` elements, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order by the value of `w` and must have at least 2 tuples, `i` is `m-2`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements. If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, `u` and `v` are in the same connected component, `_min_edge` remains `inf`, `node_u` and `node_v` remain -1, and `parent_u` is the same as `parent_v`. Otherwise, `u` and `v` are in different connected components, they are unioned, `node_u` is set to `u`, `node_v` is set to `v`, and if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`, `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`; otherwise, `_min_edge` remains unchanged.**
