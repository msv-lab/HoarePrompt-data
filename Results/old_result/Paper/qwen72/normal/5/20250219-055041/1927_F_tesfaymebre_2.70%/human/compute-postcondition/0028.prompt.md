You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: curr and parent are integers representing vertices in the graph, and path is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal.
```
def dfs(curr, parent, path):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns the list `path` which represents the current path in the DFS traversal.

Case_2: The program returns a non-empty list `res` that contains integers representing the path of a DFS traversal starting from the first neighbor `nei` of the current vertex `curr`, excluding the parent vertex `parent`. The list `res` includes at least one element `node_v` which is part of the set `set_res`.

Case_3: The program returns `res`, which is the result of the `dfs` function called with `nei` as the current vertex, `curr` as the parent, and the current `path`. If `res` is empty, the program returns an empty list. If `res` is not empty, it contains a list of integers representing a path in the DFS traversal, and `node_v` is not in this path.

Case_4: The program returns an empty list or the list `res` which is the result of the `dfs` function called with `nei` as the current vertex, `curr` as the parent, and the current `path`. If `colors[nei]` is not 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, and if `res` is not empty and `node_v` is in `set_res`, then `res` is returned. Otherwise, an empty list is returned.

Case_5: The program returns an empty list.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
In your response strictly use the format: Functionality: **the functionality you calculate.**, and describe this functionality in Natural language easily understandable by humans
