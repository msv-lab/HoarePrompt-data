Output State: **`u` and `v` are now in the same connected component in the DSU, `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated to reflect the new parent, `_min_edge` is updated to the minimum of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` and `w` if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` was less than `_min_edge`; otherwise, `_min_edge` remains unchanged. `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is updated to the minimum of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` and `w`. `graph[u]` and `graph[v]` still contain lists of `m` elements, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples sorted in descending order by the value of `w`, `i` is `m-3`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `node_u` is set to `u`, `node_v` is set to `v`.**
