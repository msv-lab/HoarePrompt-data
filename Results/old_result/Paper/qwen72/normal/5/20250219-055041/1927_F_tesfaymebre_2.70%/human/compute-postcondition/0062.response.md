The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It initializes an empty graph and an empty set of edges, and operates under the constraints that `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5). However, since the function does not take any parameters, it is unclear how `n` and `m` are used or what the function returns based on these constraints. Without additional information on the function's return value, we can only describe the parameters and constraints.
