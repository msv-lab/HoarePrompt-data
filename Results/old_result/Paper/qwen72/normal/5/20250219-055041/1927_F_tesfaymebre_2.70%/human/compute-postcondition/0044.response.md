Postcondition: ***`u` and `v` are now in the same connected component, `node_u` is set to `u`, `node_v` is set to `v`. If `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`, `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`; otherwise, `_min_edge` remains unchanged. `graph[u]` still contains the list `[v, v, ..., v]` with `m` elements, `graph[v]` still contains the list `[u, u, ..., u]` with `m` elements, `edges` is still a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order by the value of `w`, `i` is `m-2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` as determined by `dsu.find(u)`, `parent_v` is the parent of `v` as determined by `dsu.find(v)`.***
