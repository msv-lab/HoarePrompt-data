Output State: **The program returns `res`, which is the result of the `dfs` function called with `nei` as the current vertex, `curr` as the parent, and the current `path`. If `res` is empty, the program returns an empty list. If `res` is not empty, it contains a list of integers representing a path in the DFS traversal, and `node_v` is not in this path.**
