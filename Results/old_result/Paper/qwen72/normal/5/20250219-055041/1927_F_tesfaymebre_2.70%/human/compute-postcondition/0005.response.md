The only object in the loop head is the variable `test_cases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is greater than 0, the loop will execute another iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, and `func_6()` has been called twice. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must still be greater than 0.

However, the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning it is not used within the loop and its value is not relevant to the loop's execution. The loop simply iterates `test_cases` number of times, decrementing `test_cases` implicitly with each iteration.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `test_cases` must be greater than 0 (since it has already been greater than 0 and the loop is about to execute again).
- The number of times `func_6()` has been called remains unchanged from the perspective of the loop head, but it will be called again in the next iteration.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `func_6()` has been called twice.**
