Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the optimal position of the road is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
01010
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

In this case, the optimal position to lay the road is after the second house, which ensures that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. However, the program incorrectly places the road after the third house. This indicates that the program does not always find the correct position that minimizes the distance to the middle of the village while satisfying the condition.
