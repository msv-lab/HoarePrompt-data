Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `n // 2 + 1`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n // 2 + 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1`, `tleftZero` is `tleftZero + 1`, `trightZero` is `trightZero - 1`, `rightZero` is `trightZero - 1` and `rightOne` is `trightOne - 1` if the character at index `right - 1` in the string `s` is '0'. Otherwise, `rightZero` is `trightZero` and `rightOne` is `trightOne - 2`.**
