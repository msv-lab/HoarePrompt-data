The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident wanting to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident wanting to live on the right side. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.

The function returns the number of ways to assign the houses to the residents such that no resident is assigned to a house on the side they do not want to live on.
