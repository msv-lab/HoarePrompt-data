Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0.**

The code snippet initializes the variable `rightOne` to 0. Since no other variables are modified, the initial state remains unchanged, with the addition of `rightOne` being set to 0.
