Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than `mid`, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `leftMove` is 0, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, and `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`. If `right` is equal to `n`, then `right` remains `n`, and if `left` is greater than 0, it remains greater than 0. If `left` is 0 and `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the number of '0's in the first half of `s` meets this condition. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right` is not equal to `n`, then the condition `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)` is true if the absolute difference between `((n + 1) // 2 - left)` and `((n + 1) // 2 - right)` satisfies this condition. Otherwise, the condition `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) > abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)` is true.***
