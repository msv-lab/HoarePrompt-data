Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of the new `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of the new `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of the new `s`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0.**

The value of `tleftZero` has been reset to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged. The initial state is still valid, and the specific values of `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` are based on the counts of '0's and '1's in the respective halves of the string `s`.
