Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `mid`, `left` is `n // 2 - 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1`, `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`, and at least one of `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` is true.**

Explanation: The value of `rightOne` is incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
