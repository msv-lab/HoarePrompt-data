Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 2`. If the character at index `right - 1` in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is incremented by 1 and `rightZero` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` is incremented by 1 and `rightOne` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `right` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `right` is `mid + 2`.
- The conditions for `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` are based on the character at the previous index (`right - 1`), which is `mid + 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
