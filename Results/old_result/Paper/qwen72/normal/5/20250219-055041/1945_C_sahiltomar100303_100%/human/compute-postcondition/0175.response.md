Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `mid`, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, and `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`. If the character at position `i` (which is `mid`) in `s` is '0', then `trightZero` is 1 and `rightZero` is 1, and `rightOne` and `trightOne` are 0. If the character at position `i` in `s` is not '0', then `trightZero` and `rightZero` are 0, and `rightOne` is 1 and `trightOne` is 1.***
