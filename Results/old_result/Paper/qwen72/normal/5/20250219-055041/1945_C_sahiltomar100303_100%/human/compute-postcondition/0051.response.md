Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid + 2`, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `mid + 2`, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is 3, `trightOne` is 3, `rightZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0.** 

The value of `rightOne` and `trightOne` are both incremented by 1, making them 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
