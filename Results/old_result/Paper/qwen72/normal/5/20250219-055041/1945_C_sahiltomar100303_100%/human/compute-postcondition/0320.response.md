Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `mid + 1`, `rightOne` is increased by 1, `trightOne` is increased by 1.** 

The value of `trightOne` is incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `i`, `mid`, and `n` are still valid, and `rightOne` is still increased by 1.
