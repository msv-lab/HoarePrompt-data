Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid + 2`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 2`, `tleftZero` and `trightOne` must satisfy the loop condition. If `s[right]` is '0', `tleftZero` is increased by 1 and `trightZero` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 and `trightOne` is decreased by 1.***
