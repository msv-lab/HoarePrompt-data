The value of `rightOne` is incremented by 1. The character at index `i` in `s` is not '0', so `rightOne` was initially 1, and now it becomes 2. The value of `trightOne` remains 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid + 1`, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `mid + 1`, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 2, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 1.**
