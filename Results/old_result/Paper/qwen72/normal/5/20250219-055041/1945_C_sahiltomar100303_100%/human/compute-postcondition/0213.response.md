Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s` (plus 1 if `s[left - 1]` was '0'), `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `left` is `mid - 3` and must be greater than 0, `rightOne` is less than `(n - left + 1) // 2` and has been incremented by 1 if `s[left - 1]` was not '0'. If `s[left - 1]` was '0', `leftZero` is `tleftZero - 2` and `rightZero` is `trightZero + 1`. If `s[left - 1]` was not '0', `leftOne` is `tleftOne - 2` and `rightOne` is incremented by 1.**
