Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 1`. If the character at index `right` in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is incremented by 1 and `rightZero` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` is incremented by 1 and `rightOne` is decremented by 1.***
