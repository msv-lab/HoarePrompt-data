Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is 1, `leftOne` is 0, `right` is `mid`, `rightZero` is `tleftZero + tleftOne`, `rightOne` is `trightZero + trightOne`, and the character at the `right` index of `s` is '0'.**

Explanation: The value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
