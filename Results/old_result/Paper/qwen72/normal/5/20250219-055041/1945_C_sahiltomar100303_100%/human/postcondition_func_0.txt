The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. The function calculates and prints the optimal position to divide the string `s` into two halves such that the number of '0's and '1's on each side is as balanced as possible, according to the residents' preferences. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the processed test cases and the printed optimal positions for each test case.
