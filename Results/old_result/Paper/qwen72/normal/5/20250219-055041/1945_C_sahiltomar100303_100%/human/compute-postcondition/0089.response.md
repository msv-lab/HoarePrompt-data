Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at the `right` index of `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is 1, `leftOne` is 0, `rightZero` is `tleftZero + tleftOne - 1`, and `rightOne` is `trightZero + trightOne`. Otherwise, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 1, `rightZero` is `tleftZero + tleftOne`, and `rightOne` is `trightZero + trightOne - 1`.***
