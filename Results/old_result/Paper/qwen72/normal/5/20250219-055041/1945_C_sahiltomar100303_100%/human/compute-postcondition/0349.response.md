Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `mid`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is `trightZero`, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is `trightOne`, `right` is `n // 2`.**

The value of `right` is now set to `n // 2`, which is the same as the value of `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged.
