You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In the village of Letovo, there are n houses. The villagers decided to build a
big road that will divide the village into left and right sides. Each resident
wants to live on either the right or the left side of the street, which is
described as a sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n , where a_j = 0 if the resident
of the j -th house wants to live on the left side of the street; otherwise,
a_j = 1 .

The road will pass between two houses. The houses to the left of it will be
declared the left-side, and the houses to the right will be declared the
right-side. More formally, let the road pass between houses i and i+1 . Then
the houses at positions between 1 and i will be on the left side of the
street, and at positions between i+1 and n will be on the right side. The road
also may pass before the first and after the last house; in this case, the
entire village is declared to be either the right or left side, respectively.

To make the design fair, it was decided to lay the road so that at least half
of the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the choice.
That is, among x residents on one side, at least \lceil\frac{x}{2}\rceil
should want to live on that side, where \lceil x \rceil denotes rounding up a
real number x .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/75baa17903d65a630fb0d3334683e857d5fdc345.png)
To the left of the road, there will be i houses, among the corresponding a_j
there must be at least \lceil\frac{i}{2}\rceil zeros. To the right of the
road, there will be n-i houses, among the corresponding a_j there must be at
least \lceil\frac{n-i}{2}\rceil ones.

Determine after which house i the road should be laid in order to satisfy the
described condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible.
Formally, among all suitable positions i , minimize \left|\frac{n}{2} -
i\right| .

If there are multiple suitable positions i with the minimum \left|\frac{n}{2}
- i\right| , output the smaller one.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ). The description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le
3\cdot 10^5 ). The next line of each test case contains a string a of length n
, consisting only of 0 and 1 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number i — the position of the house after
which the road should be laid (if it should be laid before the first house,
output 0 ). We can show that the answer always exists.

Note

Let's consider the first example of input data.

If we lay the road after the first house, there will be one house a_1 = 1 on
the left side of the street, the resident of which would like to live on the
right side of the street. Then 0 out of 1 residents on the even side will be
satisfied with the choice, which means that the road cannot be laid after
house 1 .

If we lay the road after the second house, 1 out of 2 residents on the left
side (with preferences a_1 = 1 , a_2 = 0 ) and 1 out of 1 resident on the
right side (with preference a_3 = 1 ) will be satisfied with the choice. More
than half of the residents on each side are satisfied with the choice, which
means that the road can be laid after house 2 . We can show that this is the
optimal answer.

    #State: `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is `tleftOne + (n // 2)`, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is either 0 or not 0, `right` is `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. The function calculates and prints the optimal position to divide the string `s` into two halves such that the number of '0's and '1's on each side is as balanced as possible, according to the residents' preferences. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the processed test cases and the printed optimal positions for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find a position `i` to place a road such that at least half of the residents on the left side of the road want to live on the left side, and at least half of the residents on the right side of the road want to live on the right side.
   - The road should be placed as close to the middle of the village as possible, and if there are multiple such positions, we should choose the smallest one.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the preferences string `s`.

3. **Midpoint Calculation:**
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `n // 2`.

4. **Counting Initial Preferences:**
   - The program counts the number of zeros and ones on both the left and right sides of the midpoint.
   - `leftZero` and `leftOne` count the preferences on the left side.
   - `rightZero` and `rightOne` count the preferences on the right side.
   - `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` are temporary variables that are used to track the preferences as the road is moved.

5. **Left Movement:**
   - The program moves the road to the left (decreasing `left`) until the conditions for the left and right sides are satisfied.
   - It adjusts the counts of zeros and ones accordingly.

6. **Right Movement:**
   - The program moves the road to the right (increasing `right`) until the conditions for the left and right sides are satisfied.
   - It adjusts the counts of zeros and ones accordingly.

7. **Final Decision:**
   - The program checks if the road can be placed at the leftmost or rightmost positions.
   - If the road can be placed at both positions, it chooses the one that is closest to the midpoint.
   - If the road can only be placed at one position, it chooses that position.

8. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where the road can be placed before the first house (`left == 0`) or after the last house (`right == n`).

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The program correctly counts the number of zeros and ones on both sides of the midpoint.
  - It then moves the road to the left and right to find the optimal position that satisfies the conditions.
  - The final decision logic ensures that the road is placed as close to the midpoint as possible, and if there are multiple such positions, it chooses the smallest one.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program uses a linear scan to count the preferences and then another linear scan to find the optimal position.
  - The time complexity is \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the edge cases where the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all the edge cases and ensures that the road is placed as close to the midpoint as possible while satisfying the conditions.

### Correctness:
**True**
