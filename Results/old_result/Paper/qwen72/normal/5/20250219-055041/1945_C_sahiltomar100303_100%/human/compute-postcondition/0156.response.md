Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `leftMove` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0. If the first character of `s` is '0', then `tleftZero` is 1, `tleftOne` is 0, and `leftZero` is 2. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 1, and `leftZero` is 1.**
