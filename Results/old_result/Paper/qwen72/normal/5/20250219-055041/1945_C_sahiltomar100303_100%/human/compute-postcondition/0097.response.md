Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `right + 1`, `n` must be greater than `right`. If `s[right]` is '0', `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1 and `trightOne` is decremented by 1.**

The value of `right` is incremented by 1, and all other conditions and variable values remain unchanged. The conditions for `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` depend on the character at the new position `s[right]`.
