Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k`, and the list `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment**: The function correctly adjusts `f` and `k` by subtracting 1 from each to convert them to 0-based indices, which is necessary for Python list indexing.

3. **Sorting**: The list `a` is sorted in non-increasing order using `a.sort(reverse=True)`. This step is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

4. **Comparison Logic**:
   - If `a[k] > x`, the favorite cube will not be removed because its value is less than the value of the k-th cube in the sorted list.
   - If `a[k] < x`, the favorite cube will be removed because its value is greater than the value of the k-th cube in the sorted list.
   - If `a[k] == x`, the function checks if the favorite cube is at the boundary of the removed cubes or if it is not. Specifically:
     - `k == n - 1` checks if the favorite cube is the last cube in the sorted list, which means it will not be removed.
     - `a[k - 1] < x` checks if the cube before the k-th cube has a value less than the favorite cube, which means the favorite cube will be removed.
     - If neither condition is met, the function prints 'MAYBE' because the favorite cube could be removed or not depending on the exact positions of the cubes with the same value.

5. **Output**: The function prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each test case, which is the correct format as specified in the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly handles the problem description and produces the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
