You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` retains its initial integer value, `f` and `k` are each decreased by the number of iterations (t), `_` is incremented by the number of iterations (t), `a` is a list of integers input by the user and is sorted in descending order for each iteration, and `x` is the integer value at the index `f` in the sorted list `a` for each iteration. If `a[k]` is greater than `x` for any iteration, then `a[k]` remains greater than `x` for that iteration. If `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x` for any iteration, then `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x` for that iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Preparation:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k` from the input.
   - It adjusts `f` and `k` to be zero-indexed by subtracting 1 from each.

2. **Value of Favorite Cube:**
   - The program correctly identifies the value of the favorite cube `x` by accessing `a[f]`.

3. **Sorting the Cubes:**
   - The program sorts the list `a` in non-increasing order using `a.sort(reverse=True)`.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - The program checks if the value of the favorite cube `x` is less than the value of the `k`-th cube after sorting (`a[k]`).
     - If `a[k] > x`, the favorite cube is definitely not removed, so it prints "NO".
     - If `a[k] < x`, the favorite cube is definitely removed, so it prints "YES".
     - If `a[k] == x`, the program needs to determine if the favorite cube could be in the first `k` positions:
       - If `k == n - 1`, it means all cubes are removed, so the favorite cube is definitely removed.
       - If `a[k - 1] < x`, it means the favorite cube is the only one with value `x` in the first `k` positions, so it is definitely removed.
       - Otherwise, it prints "MAYBE" because the favorite cube could be in the first `k` positions or not, depending on the order of cubes with the same value.

### Analysis of Edge Cases:
- **All Cubes Have the Same Value:**
  - If all cubes have the same value, the program correctly handles this by checking if `a[k - 1] < x` and printing "MAYBE" if not.
- **Favorite Cube is the Only One with Its Value:**
  - If the favorite cube is the only one with its value, the program correctly prints "YES" or "NO" based on its position.
- **Multiple Cubes with the Same Value:**
  - If there are multiple cubes with the same value as the favorite cube, the program correctly prints "MAYBE" because the order of these cubes is not guaranteed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and edge cases as described in the problem statement. It follows the logic and conditions required to determine if the favorite cube will be removed, not removed, or could be either.

### Correctness:
**True**
