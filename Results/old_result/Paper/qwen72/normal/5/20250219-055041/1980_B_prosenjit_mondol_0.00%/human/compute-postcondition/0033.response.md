Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `f` is an integer value that has been decremented by 1, `k` is an integer value that has been decremented by 1, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user and is now sorted in descending order, `x` is now equal to `a[f]` after `a` has been sorted in descending order. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then `a[k]` remains greater than `x`. If `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`, then `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`.**
