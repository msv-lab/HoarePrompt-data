You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        if k in freq.values():
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
    return frequency_table



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from `arr`, and each value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, capped at `k`. The input list `arr` and the integer `k` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If `k > n`, it prints `n` because no operations can be performed if `k` is greater than the number of cards. This is correct.

3. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` is used to calculate the frequency of each card number in the list `nums`. It also ensures that the frequency of any card number does not exceed `k` by setting it to `k` if it does. This is a reasonable step because if a card number appears more than `k` times, we can only use `k` of them in a single operation.

4. **Checking for Optimal Exchange**: After calculating the frequency, the program checks if any card number appears exactly `k` times. If so, it prints `k - 1` because we can perform an exchange operation on those `k` cards and be left with `k - 1` cards. This is correct.

5. **Default Case**: If no card number appears exactly `k` times, the program prints `n`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of performing multiple operations to reduce the number of cards further.

### Detailed Analysis of the Default Case:
- **Example 4**: For the input `10 4` and `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`, the program will print `10` because no card number appears exactly `4` times. However, the correct answer should be `3` because we can perform the following operations:
  - Exchange 4 cards with number `1` for 3 new cards (10 - 4 + 3 = 9 cards left).
  - Exchange 4 cards with number `1` for 3 new cards (9 - 4 + 3 = 8 cards left).
  - Exchange 4 cards with number `1` for 3 new cards (8 - 4 + 3 = 7 cards left).
  - Exchange 4 cards with number `1` for 3 new cards (7 - 4 + 3 = 6 cards left).
  - Exchange 4 cards with number `1` for 3 new cards (6 - 4 + 3 = 5 cards left).
  - Exchange 4 cards with number `1` for 3 new cards (5 - 4 + 3 = 4 cards left).
  - Exchange 4 cards with number `1` for 3 new cards (4 - 4 + 3 = 3 cards left).

- **Example 5**: For the input `5 2` and `3 8 1 48 7`, the program will print `5` because no card number appears exactly `2` times. However, the correct answer should be `5` because no operations can be performed to reduce the number of cards further.

- **Example 6**: For the input `6 2` and `10 20 30 10 20 40`, the program will print `6` because no card number appears exactly `2` times. However, the correct answer should be `1` because we can perform the following operations:
  - Exchange 2 cards with number `10` for 1 new card (6 - 2 + 1 = 5 cards left).
  - Exchange 2 cards with number `20` for 1 new card (5 - 2 + 1 = 4 cards left).
  - Exchange 2 cards with any number for 1 new card (4 - 2 + 1 = 3 cards left).
  - Exchange 2 cards with any number for 1 new card (3 - 2 + 1 = 2 cards left).
  - Exchange 2 cards with any number for 1 new card (2 - 2 + 1 = 1 card left).

- **Example 7**: For the input `6 3` and `10 20 30 10 20 40`, the program will print `6` because no card number appears exactly `3` times. However, the correct answer should be `6` because no operations can be performed to reduce the number of cards further.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the default case where no card number appears exactly `k` times and multiple operations can be performed to reduce the number of cards further.
