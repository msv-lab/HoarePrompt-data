Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `num` is the second integer in `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the first integer in `arr` as a key. The value of the first integer in `arr` in `frequency_table` is either 1 or `k`, depending on the initial condition. The value of `num` in `frequency_table` is now `k`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers with certain constraints, `num` is the second integer in `arr`, `k` is an integer within a specific range, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the first integer in `arr` as a key.
- The code snippet `frequency_table[num] = k` updates the value of `num` in `frequency_table` to `k`.
- The value of the first integer in `arr` in `frequency_table` remains either 1 or `k`, depending on the initial condition.
- The states of `arr`, `num`, and `k` are not affected by the code snippet.
