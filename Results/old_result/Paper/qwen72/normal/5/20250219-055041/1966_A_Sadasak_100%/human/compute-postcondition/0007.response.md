Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `num` is the second integer in `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the first integer in `arr` as a key. If `frequency_table[first integer in arr]` > `k`, then the value of the first integer in `arr` in `frequency_table` is set to `k`. Otherwise, the value of the first integer in `arr` in `frequency_table` remains 1. The value of `num` in `frequency_table` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1` updates the value of `num` in the `frequency_table` dictionary.
- If `num` is already a key in `frequency_table`, its value is incremented by 1.
- If `num` is not a key in `frequency_table`, it is added with a value of 1.
- The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
