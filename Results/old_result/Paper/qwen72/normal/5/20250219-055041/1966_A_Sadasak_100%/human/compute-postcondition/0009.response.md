Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `num` is the second integer in `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the first integer in `arr` as a key. The value of the first integer in `arr` in `frequency_table` is either 1 or `k`, depending on the initial condition. If `frequency_table[num]` > `k`, then the value of `num` in `frequency_table` is set to `k`. Otherwise, the value of `num` in `frequency_table` is incremented by 1.***
