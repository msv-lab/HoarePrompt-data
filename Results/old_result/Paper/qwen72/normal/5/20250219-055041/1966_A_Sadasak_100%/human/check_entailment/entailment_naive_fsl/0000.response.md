Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in the main loop and the function `func_1` is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
5
```

The program incorrectly prints `5` instead of `2`. The issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function and the main loop. The function `func_1` is supposed to count the frequency of each number in the list, but it incorrectly caps the frequency at `k` instead of handling the exchange operations correctly. Additionally, the main loop does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. The program needs to account for the fact that you can exchange `k` cards for `k-1` cards, and it should compute the minimum number of cards left after all possible exchanges.
