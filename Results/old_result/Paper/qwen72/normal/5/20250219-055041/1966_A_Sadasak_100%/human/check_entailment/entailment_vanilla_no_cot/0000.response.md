Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue lies in the logic used to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and if so, prints `k-1`. This is incorrect because the minimum number of cards left is not necessarily `k-1` just because there is a group of `k` cards. The correct approach involves more complex logic to determine the minimum number of cards that cannot be grouped into sets of `k`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        min_cards = n
        for count in freq.values():
            if count % k != 0:
                min_cards = min(min_cards, count % k)
        print(min_cards)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    return frequency_table
```

In this corrected version:
1. We calculate the frequency of each card number.
2. We then determine the minimum number of cards that cannot be grouped into sets of `k` by checking the remainder of each frequency when divided by `k`.
3. The minimum number of cards left is the smallest non-zero remainder found.

This approach ensures that we correctly find the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.
