Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) with at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and 'NO', `j` is `n`, `reachable_first_row` is False.**

The variable `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`, and all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
