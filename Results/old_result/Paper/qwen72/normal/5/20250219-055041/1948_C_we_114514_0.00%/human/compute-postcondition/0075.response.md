The code snippet provided does not change the value of `reachable_second_row` because it is already set to `True` in the initial state. The other variables are not affected by the code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing either the string 'YES' or 'NO', `n` is the first element of the second test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `j` is 0, `reachable_second_row` is True, and `j` is equal to `n - 1`. The character at index `j` in `row2` is '>'**.
