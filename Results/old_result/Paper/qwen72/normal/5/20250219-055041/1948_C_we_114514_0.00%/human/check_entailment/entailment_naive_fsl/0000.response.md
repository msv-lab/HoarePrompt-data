Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the movement of the robot as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining if the robot can reach cell (2, n) is flawed. The program incorrectly updates the `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` flags, and it does not properly simulate the robot's movements according to the rules.

Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4
>><<
>>><
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

In this case, the robot can indeed reach cell (2, 4) with the following path:
1. (1, 1) → (1, 2) (due to the arrow in (1, 1) pointing right)
2. (1, 2) → (1, 3) (due to the arrow in (1, 2) pointing right)
3. (1, 3) → (2, 3) (due to the arrow in (1, 3) pointing left, and the robot moves down)
4. (2, 3) → (2, 4) (due to the arrow in (2, 3) pointing right)

However, the provided program incorrectly concludes that the robot cannot reach cell (2, 4). This is because the program does not correctly simulate the robot's movements and the conditions under which it can switch rows.
