Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that has been fully iterated over, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in `test_cases`. For each test case, if the robot can move from the first row to the second row or stay in the second row until the end, `results` contains 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` contains 'NO'.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is the total number of test cases.
- The list `test_cases` is fully iterated over, meaning all test cases have been processed.
- The list `results` now contains a 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, depending on whether the robot can move from the first row to the second row or stay in the second row until the end of the grid.
- The variables `n`, `row1`, `row2`, `reachable_first_row`, and `reachable_second_row` are local to each iteration of the loop and are reset for each new test case.
- The final state of `results` reflects the outcome of the loop for all test cases.
