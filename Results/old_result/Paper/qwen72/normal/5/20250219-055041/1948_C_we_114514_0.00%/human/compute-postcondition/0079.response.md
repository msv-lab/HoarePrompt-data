The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `j` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is the first element of the second test case and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `j`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing either the string 'YES' or 'NO', `n` is the first element of the second test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `j` is 1. If `reachable_second_row` is True and `j` is equal to `n - 1` and the character at index `j` in `row2` is '>', the program continues as expected. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains True or False as determined by the precondition, and the program continues with the same state as described in the precondition.**
