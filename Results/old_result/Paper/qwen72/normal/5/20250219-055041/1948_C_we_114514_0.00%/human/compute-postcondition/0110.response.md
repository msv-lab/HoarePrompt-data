Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `j` is `n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` is False, and `reachable_second_row` is True if the last character of `row2` is '>', otherwise it remains False. If `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' or 'NO' and now includes an additional 'YES'. If `reachable_second_row` is False, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and 'NO'.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `n, (row1, row2) = test_case` unpacks the third test case from the `test_cases` list into `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
- `n` is assigned the first element of the third test case, which is an integer greater than 0.
- `row1` is assigned the second element of the third test case.
- `row2` is assigned the third element of the third test case.
- The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `test_case`, `j`, `reachable_first_row`, and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged.
- The value of `results` remains unchanged, as the code snippet does not modify it directly.
