To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables and conditions that are part of the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for j in range(n):
```

The variables and conditions that are relevant to the loop head are:
- `j`: The loop counter, which is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
- `n`: The upper limit of the loop, which must be greater than the current value of `j` for the loop to execute again.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 2 test cases.
- `test_case` is the second test case in the list.
- `results` is a list containing either the string 'YES' or 'NO'.
- `n` is the first element of the second test case and must be greater than 0.
- `row1` is the second element of the second test case.
- `row2` is the third element of the second test case.
- `j` is 1.
- `reachable_second_row` is True if `row2[j] == '>'` and `j == n - 1`.
- `reachable_first_row` retains its value as determined by the precondition.

At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing either the string 'YES' or 'NO', `n` is the first element of the second test case and must be greater than 1, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `j` is 2, `reachable_second_row` retains its value as determined by the precondition, and `reachable_first_row` retains its value as determined by the precondition.**
