The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `j` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is not explicitly set before the loop, as it will be set by the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is False, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and 'NO'**
