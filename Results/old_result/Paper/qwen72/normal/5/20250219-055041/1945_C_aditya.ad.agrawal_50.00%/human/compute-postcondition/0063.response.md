Output State: **`pos` is 0, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `ans` is 0, `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the conditions are satisfied, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of the corresponding character in `input_string`, `z` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the count of ones in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`.**

Explanation:
- `pos` is updated to 0.
- `ans` is updated to 0.
- `dist` is assigned the value `abs(n / 2)`.
- The values of `z_l`, `o_l`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `b_d`, `t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, and `o` remain unchanged.
