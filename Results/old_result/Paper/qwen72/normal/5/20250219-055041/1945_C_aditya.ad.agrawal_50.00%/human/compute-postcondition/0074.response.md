Output State: **`pos` is 1, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 1, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of the corresponding character in `input_string` and must have at least 1 element, `z` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the count of ones in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, If `o - 1` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o - 1) / 2`, then `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)`. Otherwise, `b_d` is 30001. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0.**
