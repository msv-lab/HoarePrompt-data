Output State: **The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 3Â·10^5. `t` must be greater than 0. `n` is now an input integer. `input_string` is an input string. `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1).**
