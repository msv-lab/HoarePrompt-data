Postcondition: ***The function `func` processes multiple test cases with each test case including an integer `n` representing the number of houses and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 3Â·10^5. `t` is greater than 0. `n` is an input integer. `input_string` is an input string. `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1). `z` is the count of zeros in `arr`. `o` is the count of ones in `arr`. `z_r` is equal to `z`. `o_r` is equal to `o`. `z_l` is 0. `o_l` is 0. `dist` is equal to `abs(n / 2)`. `ans` is 0. `pos` is 0. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, `b_d` is set to `dist`. Otherwise, `b_d` is set to 30001.***
