Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `arr` and its current value is 0, `pos` is increased by 1, `z_l` is increased by 1, `z_r` is decreased by 1.**

The code snippet `z_r -= 1` decreases the value of `z_r` by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the updated value of `z_r`.
