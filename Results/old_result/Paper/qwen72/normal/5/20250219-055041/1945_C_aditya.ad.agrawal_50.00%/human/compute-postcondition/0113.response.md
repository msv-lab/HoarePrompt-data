Output State: **`pos` is 0, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of ones in `arr`, `ans` is 0, `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the condition was satisfied, `t` is non-zero, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is the user input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer, `z` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the count of ones in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`.**
