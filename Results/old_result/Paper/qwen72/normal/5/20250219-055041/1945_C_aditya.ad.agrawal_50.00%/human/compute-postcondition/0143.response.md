Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `b_d`, and `ans` remain as they were, `z_r` is decreased by 1.** 

The value of `z_r` is decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The list `arr` is still non-empty, `i` is still the next element in `arr`, `pos` is still increased by 1, and `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `b_d`, and `ans` retain their previous values.
