Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the road should be laid before the first house (output 0) or after the last house (output n). The current logic only checks positions between the houses, but it should also consider these edge cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
000
```
The correct output should be `0` because laying the road before the first house satisfies the condition (all residents are on the right side, and at least half of them want to live on the right side). However, the program will output `1` because it does not check the case where the road is laid before the first house.
