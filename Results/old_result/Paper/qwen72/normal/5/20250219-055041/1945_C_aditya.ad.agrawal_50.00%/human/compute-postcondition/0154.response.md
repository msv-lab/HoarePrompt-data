The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident's preference to live on the left side and '1' indicates a preference to live on the right side. The total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5. The function returns the number of houses that need to be built on the left side and the number of houses that need to be built on the right side to satisfy all residents' preferences for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` containing '0' and '1'. It returns the number of houses to be built on the left side and the number of houses to be built on the right side to satisfy the residents' preferences for each test case.**
