Output State: **`pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, `z_l` is the count of zeros in the first half of `arr`, `o_l` is the count of ones in the first half of `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `ans` is the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` were last met, `b_d` is the absolute difference between `n / 2` and the position where the conditions were last met.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- `pos` will be equal to the total number of elements in `arr`.
- `z_l` will be the count of zeros in the first half of `arr`.
- `o_l` will be the count of ones in the first half of `arr`.
- `z_r` and `o_r` will both be 0, as all elements in `arr` have been processed.
- `ans` will be the position in the array where the conditions for balancing the counts of zeros and ones were last met.
- `b_d` will be the absolute difference between `n / 2` and the position where the conditions were last met. If the conditions were never met, `ans` and `b_d` will remain unchanged from their initial values.
