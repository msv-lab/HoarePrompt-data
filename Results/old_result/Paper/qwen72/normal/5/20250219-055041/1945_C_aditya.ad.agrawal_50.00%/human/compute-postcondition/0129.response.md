Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `pos` is increased by 1. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is not 0, `o_l` is increased by 1, and `o_r` is decreased by 1. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_l` and `o_l`, and `b_d` is greater than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos`, then `ans` is equal to `pos`.***
