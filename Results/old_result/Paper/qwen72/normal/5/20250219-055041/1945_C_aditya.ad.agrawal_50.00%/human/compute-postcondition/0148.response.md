Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `b_d`, and `ans` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration. If `i` == 0, `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_r` is decreased by 1 and `o_l` is increased by 1. `ans` is now equal to `pos`, and `b_d` is now equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.**

Explanation:
- `arr` remains a non-empty list of integers.
- `i` is the next element in `arr`, and its value is not specified.
- `pos` is increased by 1.
- `o_r`, `z_l`, and `o_l` are updated based on the value of `i`:
  - If `i` is 0, `z_r` is decreased by 1.
  - Otherwise, `o_r` is decreased by 1 and `o_l` is increased by 1.
- `ans` is now equal to the updated value of `pos`.
- `b_d` is calculated as `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, where `n` is the length of `arr` and `pos` is the updated position.
