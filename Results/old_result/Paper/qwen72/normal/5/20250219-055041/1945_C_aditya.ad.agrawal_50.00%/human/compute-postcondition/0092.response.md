Output State: **`pos` is 3, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of the corresponding character in `input_string` and must have at least 3 elements, `z` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the count of ones in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is `z - 2`, `o_r` is `o`, `ans` is 0, `b_d` is greater than `abs(n / 2 - 3)`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `z_l += 1` increments the value of `z_l` by 1.
- Initially, `z_l` was 0, so after the increment, `z_l` is now 1.
- The value of `o_l` remains 0, as it is not affected by the code snippet.
- The values of `z_r` and `o_r` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code snippet.
- The values of `pos`, `t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `dist`, `i`, `ans`, and `b_d` remain the same as in the initial state.
