Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the next element in `arr`, and `pos` is increased by 1. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d` is greater than `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is equal to `pos` and `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. If `i` == 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1. If the conditions are not met, the state of `ans` and `b_d` remains unchanged.***
