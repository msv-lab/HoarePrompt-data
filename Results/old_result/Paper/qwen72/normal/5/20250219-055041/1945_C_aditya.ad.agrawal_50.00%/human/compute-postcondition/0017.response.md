To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`. The loop will execute if `arr` is not empty. Given the initial state, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1). For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element.

Here is the adjusted state:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `arr`**
