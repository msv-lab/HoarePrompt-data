Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1) and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `o_l` is increased by 1, `o_r` is decreased by 1.**

The value of `o_r` is decreased by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still contains integers converted from characters in `input_string`, `i` is still the third element in `arr`, `pos` is still increased by 1, and `o_l` is still increased by 1.
