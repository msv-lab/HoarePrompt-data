Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `pos` is increased by 1, `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1, `z_r` is decreased by 1.** 

The value of `z_r` is decreased by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state information that `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `pos` is increased by 1, `i` is 0, and `z_l` is increased by 1, is still valid.
