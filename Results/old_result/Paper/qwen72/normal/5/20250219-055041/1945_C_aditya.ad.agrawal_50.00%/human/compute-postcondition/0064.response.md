Output State: **`pos` is 0, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `ans` is 0, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of the corresponding character in `input_string`, `z` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the count of ones in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`.**

The value of `b_d` is updated to `abs(n / 2)`, which is the same as the value of `dist`. All other variables remain unchanged.
