Output State: **`pos` is equal to `n`. `z_l` is the count of zeros in the first `pos` elements of `arr`. `o_l` is the count of ones in the first `pos` elements of `arr`. `z_r` is the count of zeros in the remaining elements of `arr` (which is 0 because `pos` is equal to `n`). `o_r` is the count of ones in the remaining elements of `arr` (which is 0 because `pos` is equal to `n`). `ans` is the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` are satisfied and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` is minimized. `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the conditions are satisfied.**

Explanation:
- After the loop has executed all `n` iterations, `pos` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in `arr`.
- `z_l` will be the total count of zeros in `arr`, and `o_l` will be the total count of ones in `arr`.
- Since `pos` is now equal to `n`, `z_r` and `o_r` will both be 0, as all elements have been processed.
- `ans` will be the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` are satisfied, and `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` for which these conditions hold true. If no such position exists, `ans` will remain 0 and `b_d` will retain its initial value or the last updated value.
