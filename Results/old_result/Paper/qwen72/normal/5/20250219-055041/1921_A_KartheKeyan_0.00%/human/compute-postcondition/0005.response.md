The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the range `4`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range `4`. Since `range(4)` will always produce a sequence from `0` to `3` (inclusive), the loop will always execute 4 times regardless of the other variables. However, for the loop to start, `i` should be initialized to `0`.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0**
