Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is `n - 1` (where `n` must be greater than 1), `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are the input integers, `p1` and `p2` are undefined because `coord` is empty.** 

The variables `x` and `y` are now assigned the values of the input integers provided by the user. The other variables remain unchanged.
