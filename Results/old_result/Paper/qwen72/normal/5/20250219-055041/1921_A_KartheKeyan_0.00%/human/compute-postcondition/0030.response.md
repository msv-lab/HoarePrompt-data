The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limit, which is 4. The state of `i` needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2. The range limit (4) remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is `n - 1` (where `n` must be greater than 1), `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are the input integers, `p1` and `p2` are undefined because `coord` now contains two elements.**
