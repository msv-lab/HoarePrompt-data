Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are input integers.**

The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `x` and `y`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `coord`, and `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `x` and `y` are now specific input integers.
