Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is `n - 2` (where `n` must be greater than 1), `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`, `x` and `y` are the input integers, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is decremented by 1, so if `n` was initially `n - 1` (where `n` must be greater than 1), after the execution, `n` becomes `n - 2`.
- All other variables (`i`, `coord`, `res`, `x`, `y`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged.
