Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is 3.
2. `n` is `n - 1` (where `n` must be greater than 1). This means `n` is some value greater than 1, and the initial state is setting `n` to `n - 1`.
3. `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`. This means all tuples in the list have the same `x` and `y` values.
4. `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`.
5. `x` and `y` are input integers.
6. `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`.
7. `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`coord` List:**
   - Since `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, all elements in the list are identical.
   - Therefore, `coord[1][0]` is `x`, `coord[0][0]` is `x`, `coord[3][0]` is `x`, and `coord[2][0]` is `x`.

2. **Calculating `p1` and `p2`:**
   - `p1 = coord[1][0] - coord[0][0] = x - x = 0`
   - `p2 = coord[3][0] - coord[2][0] = x - x = 0`

3. **Calculating `res`:**
   - `res = abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`
   - Since `p1` and `p2` are both 0, `math.sqrt(p1)` is `0` and `math.sqrt(p2)` is `0`.
   - Therefore, `res = abs(0 * 0) = abs(0) = 0`

### Final Output:
The `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
