The code `coord.append((x, y))` appends the tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. The values of `i`, `n`, `res`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The new tuple `(x, y)` is added to the existing list `coord`, which initially contains two tuples `(x, y)` and `(x, y)`. Therefore, the list `coord` now contains three tuples, all of which are `(x, y)`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are input integers.**
