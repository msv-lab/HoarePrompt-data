Output State: **`i` is 3, `coord` is a sorted list with 7 elements, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- The list `coord` remains a sorted list with 7 elements.
- `p1` is still `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`.
- `p2` is still `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.
- `res` is assigned the value of the absolute product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`. The specific value of `res` depends on the values of `coord`, but it is calculated as `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`.
