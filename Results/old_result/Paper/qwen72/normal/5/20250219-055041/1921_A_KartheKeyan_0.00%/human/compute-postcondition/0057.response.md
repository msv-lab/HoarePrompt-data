Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 3.
- `coord` is a sorted list with 7 elements.
- `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`.
- `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.
- `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`coord` List:**
   - `coord` is a sorted list with 7 elements. Each element in `coord` is a tuple or list with at least one element (since we are accessing `coord[i][0]`).

2. **`p1` Calculation:**
   - `p1` is calculated as the difference between the first element of the second tuple in `coord` and the first element of the first tuple in `coord`.
   - `p1 = coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]`.

3. **`p2` Calculation:**
   - `p2` is calculated as the difference between the first element of the fourth tuple in `coord` and the first element of the third tuple in `coord`.
   - `p2 = coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]`.

4. **`res` Calculation:**
   - `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
   - `res = abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`.

### Final Output:
- The `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`, which is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.

Since the exact values of the elements in `coord` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the given information, the print statement will output the calculated value of `res`.

Output: **res (where res is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of p1 and p2, and p1 is the difference between the first elements of the second and first tuples in coord, and p2 is the difference between the first elements of the fourth and third tuples in coord)**
