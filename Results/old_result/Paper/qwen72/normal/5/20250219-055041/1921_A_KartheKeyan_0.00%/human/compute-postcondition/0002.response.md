The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is truthy (i.e., not 0), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **The function has executed, and for each test case, it has printed a value `s` which is calculated as `(l//4) + (l - (4*(l//4)))//2`. The number of test cases `n` has been decremented by 1 for each iteration until `n` reaches 0. The initial state of the list of test cases and the coordinates of the squares remain unchanged. `n` must be greater than 0**
