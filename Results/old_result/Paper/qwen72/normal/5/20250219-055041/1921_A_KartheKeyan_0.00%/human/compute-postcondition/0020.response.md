Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is `n - 1` (where `n` must be greater than 0), `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `x` and `y` are input integers, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second tuples in `coord`, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord`.**

The value of `n` has been decremented by 1, but it must still be greater than 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
