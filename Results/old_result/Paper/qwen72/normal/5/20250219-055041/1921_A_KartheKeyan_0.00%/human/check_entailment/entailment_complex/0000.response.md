### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times to process each test case. For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates and stores them in the list `coord`.

2. **Sorting Coordinates**: The function sorts the list `coord`. Sorting the coordinates ensures that the points are in a specific order, which is necessary for the subsequent calculations. However, the sorting is done lexicographically (first by x-coordinate, then by y-coordinate), which is not the most intuitive way to handle the coordinates of a square. Nevertheless, for a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, this sorting will group the points in a way that allows us to easily find the side lengths.

3. **Calculating Side Lengths**:
   - `p1` is calculated as the squared distance between the first and second points in the sorted list.
   - `p2` is calculated as the squared distance between the third and fourth points in the sorted list.
   - Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the distance between the first and second points (or any two adjacent points) should be the same as the distance between the third and fourth points (or any other pair of adjacent points).

4. **Calculating Area**:
   - The area of the square is calculated by taking the square root of `p1` and `p2`, multiplying them, and then taking the absolute value of the result.
   - However, this step is unnecessary because `p1` and `p2` should be equal (since they represent the squared side lengths of the square), and the area of the square is simply the side length squared. Therefore, `res` should be `p1` or `p2` directly, without the need for square roots and multiplication.

5. **Output**: The function prints the calculated area for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Unnecessary Calculation**: The use of `math.sqrt` and multiplication is unnecessary. The area of the square can be directly calculated as `p1` or `p2` since they represent the squared side length.
- **Potential Bug**: If the points are not sorted in a way that groups the adjacent points together, the calculation of `p1` and `p2` might be incorrect. However, given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the sorting method used should work correctly for squares with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        
        for i in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        coord = sorted(coord)
        
        side_length_squared = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
        
        area = side_length_squared
        
        print(area)
        
        n -= 1
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is **incorrect** because it performs unnecessary and potentially incorrect calculations to determine the area of the square. The corrected code directly calculates the area using the squared side length, which is more efficient and correct.

### Correctness:
**False**
