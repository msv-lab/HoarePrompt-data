The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, where `n` is the length of the strings and all strings consist of lowercase Latin letters. The function then checks, for each character position in the strings, if the character in `a` or `b` matches the corresponding character in `c`. If at any position, both `a` and `b` do not match `c`, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no return value.
