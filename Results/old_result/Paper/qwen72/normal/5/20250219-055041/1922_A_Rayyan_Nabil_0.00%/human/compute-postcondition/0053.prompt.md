Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 20, a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, l is 'YES'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    c = input()
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            l = 'YES'
    else:
        l = 'NO'
    print(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is an input string. If for any index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the character at index `i` in `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `c` and the character at index `i` in `b` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `c`, then `l` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` is 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string. If any character at index `i` in `a` is not equal to the corresponding character in `c` and the character at index `i` in `b` is also not equal to the corresponding character in `c`, then `l` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` remains 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than `n`, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings, and `l` is 'NO' or 'YES'. If any character in `a` or `b` at position `i` (for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`) is not equal to the corresponding character in `c`, then `l` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` remains 'NO'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
