Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is an input string. If for any index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the character at index `i` in `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `c` and the character at index `i` in `b` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `c`, then `l` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` is 'NO'.**

This means that after the loop has executed all `n` iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `n-1`, and the variable `l` will be 'YES' if there is at least one index `i` where the characters in `a` and `b` are both different from the character in `c` at that index. If no such index exists, `l` will be 'NO'. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial state.
