The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints. However, based on the given parameters, we can infer that the function likely processes these strings in some way, possibly comparing or manipulating them, and returns a value or values that reflect the result of this processing.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific nature of the result is not provided.**
