### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the operation of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them any number of times.
   - The array is considered sorted if for every pair of consecutive elements \( a_i \leq a_{i+1} \).

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(arr)` checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No' if there is any pair of consecutive elements where \( a_i > a_{i+1} \).
   - However, this function does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the split and swap operation multiple times. This is a critical oversight because the operation can be performed any number of times, and there might be a way to sort the array by finding the correct split points.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2()` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the length of each array `n`.
   - It correctly reads the elements of each array and calls `func_1(arr)` to check if the array can be sorted.
   - The results are collected and printed at the end.
   - The function `func_2` itself is correctly structured to handle the input and output format as specified in the problem description.

4. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - The current implementation of `func_1(arr)` is indeed incorrect because it only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient.
   - The problem requires checking if there exists a split point \( k \) such that the array can be split into two parts \( x \) and \( y \) where \( x = a[0:k] \) and \( y = a[k:n] \).
   - After swapping, the array should be \( y + x \) and should be non-decreasing.
   - This means that the last element of \( y \) should be less than or equal to the first element of \( x \), and both \( x \) and \( y \) should be non-decreasing.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to implement a more sophisticated check in `func_1(arr)`.
   - We should find a split point \( k \) such that:
     - \( a[k-1] \leq a[0] \) and \( a[n-1] \leq a[k] \) (if \( k > 0 \) and \( k < n \)).
     - Both \( a[0:k] \) and \( a[k:n] \) should be non-decreasing.
   - If such a split point exists, the array can be sorted by performing the split and swap operation.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation of `func_1(arr)` is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the split and swap operation.
   - Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.
