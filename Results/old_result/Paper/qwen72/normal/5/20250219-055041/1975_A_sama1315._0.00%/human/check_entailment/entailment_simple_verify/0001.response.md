### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the operation of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them any number of times.
   - The array is considered sorted if for every pair of consecutive elements \( a_i \leq a_{i+1} \).

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(arr)` checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No' if there is any pair of consecutive elements where \( a_i > a_{i+1} \).
   - The function does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the split and swap operation multiple times.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2()` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the length of each array `n`.
   - It correctly reads the elements of each array and calls `func_1(arr)` to check if the array can be sorted.
   - The results are collected and printed at the end.

4. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - The current implementation of `func_1(arr)` only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient.
   - The problem requires checking if the array can be sorted by performing the split and swap operation any number of times.
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if there exists a split point \( k \) such that the array can be split into two parts \( x \) and \( y \) where \( x = a[0:k] \) and \( y = a[k:n] \).
   - After swapping, the array should be \( y + x \) and should be non-decreasing.
   - This means that the last element of \( y \) should be less than or equal to the first element of \( x \), and both \( x \) and \( y \) should be non-decreasing.

5. **Original Assessment Validation**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that `func_1(arr)` is insufficient because it only checks if the array is already sorted.
   - The assessment correctly states that the problem requires checking if the array can be sorted by performing the split and swap operation.
   - The assessment correctly concludes that the current implementation is incorrect.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation of `func_1(arr)` is indeed incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the split and swap operation.
   - Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

### Final:
**False**

The original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to check if the array can be sorted by performing the split and swap operation.
