The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `arr`. It checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order (i.e., each element is less than or equal to the next element). If the list is sorted in non-decreasing order, the function returns 'Yes'. If there is at least one pair of consecutive elements where the first element is greater than the second, the function returns 'No'.
