Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 3 + 2n, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(arr)` and the new value `result` appended to it, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`, `n` is now the integer value of `data[2 + n]`.**
