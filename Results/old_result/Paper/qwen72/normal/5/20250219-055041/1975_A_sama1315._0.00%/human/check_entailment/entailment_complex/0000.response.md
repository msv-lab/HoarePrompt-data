Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted into non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them. This operation can be performed any number of times.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.
   - However, this function does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the swap operation. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient to solve the problem.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes it to extract multiple test cases, and applies `func_1` to each test case.
   - It correctly handles the input format and iterates over the test cases.
   - It collects the results from `func_1` and prints them.

4. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program is incorrect because `func_1` does not implement the logic to check if the array can be sorted by performing the swap operation. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not enough to meet the problem requirements.
   - To correctly solve the problem, `func_1` should check if there exists a split point such that the array can be sorted by swapping the prefix and suffix. This involves checking if the array can be split into two parts where the first part is non-decreasing, the second part is non-decreasing, and the last element of the first part is less than or equal to the first element of the second part.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
