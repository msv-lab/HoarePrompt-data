Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`, `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 3 + 2n, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(arr)` and the new value `result` appended to it, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`**

Explanation:
- `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`.
- The values of `t`, `arr`, `data`, `index`, `results`, and `result` remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected by the code snippet.
