The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the loop control variable `t`. The loop will execute again if `t` is greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 1, and `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration. Since the loop is controlled by `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is still greater than 1 for the next iteration to occur.

Given that `t` must be greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration to start, `t` must now be greater than 0 (since `_` is incremented by 1 and the loop checks if `_` is less than `t`).

The other variables (`n`, `arr`, `data`, `index`, `results`, `result`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 3 + 2n, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(arr)` and the new value `result` appended to it, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`, `n` is now the integer value of `data[2 + n]`**
