The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` should be 0 before the loop starts to ensure the loop iterates correctly from the first test case.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list, each test case includes a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D"**
