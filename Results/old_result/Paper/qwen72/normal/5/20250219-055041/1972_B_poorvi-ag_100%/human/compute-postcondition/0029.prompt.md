Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations, `t` is the total number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is the last input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is the last input string, and `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on whether the number of occurrences of 'U' in the corresponding `arr` is odd or even.
Code of the loop:
for i in results:
    print(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the total number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is not relevant, `n` is the last input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is the last input string, `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case and must have at least one element

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the total number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is not relevant, `n` is the last input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is the last input string, `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case and must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element in the `results` list

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the total number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is not relevant, `n` is the last input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is the last input string, `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case and must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element in the `results` list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
