Output State: **After all iterations, `t` is the total number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is the last input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is the last input string, and `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on whether the number of occurrences of 'U' in the corresponding `arr` is odd or even.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains the total number of test cases.
- The variable `i` is the index of the last test case, which is `t - 1`.
- The variable `n` holds the last input integer representing the number of coins.
- The variable `arr` holds the last input string representing the state of the coins.
- The list `results` contains 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, depending on whether the number of 'U' in the corresponding `arr` was odd or even.
