Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is an input string, and `results` is a list. If the number of occurrences of 'U' in `arr` is odd, `results` contains an additional 'yes' appended to it. If the number of occurrences of 'U' in `arr` is even, `results` contains an additional 'no' appended to it.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to the integer input provided by the user, which is within the range 1 to 100. The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
