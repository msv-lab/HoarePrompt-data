The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `t` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is an input string, and `results` is a list. If the number of occurrences of 'U' in `arr` is odd, `results` contains an additional 'yes' appended to it. If the number of occurrences of 'U' in `arr` is even, `results` contains an additional 'no' appended to it.**
