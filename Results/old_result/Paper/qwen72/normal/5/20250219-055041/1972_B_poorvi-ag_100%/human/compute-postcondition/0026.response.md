Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is the total number of test cases, and it is given that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `i` is not relevant to the task.
   - `n` is the last input integer, and it is given that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `arr` is the last input string.
   - `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, and it must have at least two elements.
   - `i` is the second element in the `results` list.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly stated to be the second element in the `results` list.
   - Since `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case and must have at least two elements, the second element in `results` will be either 'yes' or 'no'.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the second element of the `results` list, which is either 'yes' or 'no'.

Output: **i (where i is the second element in the `results` list, which is either 'yes' or 'no')**
