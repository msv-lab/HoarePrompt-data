The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It determines for each test case whether the number of "U" characters in the string is odd. If the number of "U" characters is odd, it appends 'yes' to a results list; otherwise, it appends 'no'. After processing all test cases, it prints each element in the results list. The function does not return any value, but the final state is that `results` contains 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, and `t` is the total number of test cases processed.
