Output State: **`num` is a string that, when converted to an integer, must be greater than 0, `numbers` is 0, `out` is an empty list, `list2` contains the integer value of the third element of `list1` and the integer value of the fifth element of `list1`, `list1` is a sorted list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `b` by whitespace, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is an input string, `i` is 1, `a` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- `list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))` appends the integer value of the fifth element of `list1` to `list2` (since `i` is 1, `2 * i` is 2, and the index `2 * i` points to the fifth element in a zero-indexed list).
- The initial state specifies that `list2` already contains the integer value of the third element of `list1`.
- Therefore, `list2` now contains both the integer value of the third element and the integer value of the fifth element of `list1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
