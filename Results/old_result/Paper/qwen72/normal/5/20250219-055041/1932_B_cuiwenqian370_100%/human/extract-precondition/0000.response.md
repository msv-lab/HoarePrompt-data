The function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should take the number of signs `n` and a list of integers `a` representing the periodicities of the signs as inputs. Here's the correct function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```
def apocalypse_year(n, a):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.**
