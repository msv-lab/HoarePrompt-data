Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `i` is `n-1`, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `results` includes the string representation of `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_`, `index` is incremented by 1.**

The code snippet `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, `last_year`, `next_year`, `results`, and `_` remain unchanged, and the condition that `T` must be greater than `_` still holds. The updated value of `index` is now `index + 1`.
