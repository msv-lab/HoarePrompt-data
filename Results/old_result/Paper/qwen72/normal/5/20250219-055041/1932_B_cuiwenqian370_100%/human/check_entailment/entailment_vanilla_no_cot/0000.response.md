Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is efficient for large inputs. It then splits the input into a list of strings.

2. **Processing Test Cases**: The program processes each test case one by one. It initializes `T` with the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.

3. **Reading Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

4. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign**:
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first periodicity `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left\lceil \frac{\text{last\_year} + 1}{\text{a[i]}} \right\rceil \times \text{a[i]}
     \]
     This formula ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous sign.
   - It updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.

5. **Storing Results**: The program stores the result for each test case in the `results` list.

6. **Writing Output**: Finally, it writes the results to the standard output, each on a new line.

The logic and implementation are correct, and the program should produce the expected output for the given problem.
