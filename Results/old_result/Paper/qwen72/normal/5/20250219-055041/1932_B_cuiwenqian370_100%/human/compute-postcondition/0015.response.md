The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1]) * a[1]`.
- `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1]) * a[1]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n` must still be true. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` will be 2 in the next iteration. For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1]) * a[1]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1]) * a[1]`**
