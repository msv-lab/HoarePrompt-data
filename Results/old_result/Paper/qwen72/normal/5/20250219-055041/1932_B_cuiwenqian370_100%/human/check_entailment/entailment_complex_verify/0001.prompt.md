You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

    #State: The loop has completed all `T` iterations. `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]` from the last iteration, `a` is the list of `n` integers from the last iteration, `last_year` is the final computed value for the last iteration, `next_year` is the same as `last_year` from the last iteration, `results` is a list containing the string representations of the final `last_year` values from each of the `T` iterations, `index` is `1 + T + sum(n for each iteration)`, and `_` is `T - 1`.
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes multiple sets of data, and writes the results to `sys.stdout`. Each set of data consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. The function computes a value for each set based on the elements of `a` and appends the string representation of this value to a results list. After processing all sets, it writes the results to `sys.stdout`, each on a new line. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `sys.stdout` contains the computed results, and the internal variables used for processing (such as `index`, `results`, `last_year`, and `next_year`) are in their final states after the last iteration.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splitting it into a list of strings.
   - It then initializes an index to keep track of the current position in the input list.
   - The first integer `T` is read, which represents the number of test cases.

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` to the first periodicity `a[0]`, which is the year when the first sign occurs.

3. **Calculating the Next Year**:
   - For each subsequent sign (from the second to the nth), the program calculates the next year when the sign will occur.
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left( \text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1 \right) // a[i] \times a[i]
     \]
     - This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year + 1`.
     - `last_year + 1` is used to ensure that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous sign.
     - The expression `// a[i] * a[i]` ensures that the result is a multiple of `a[i]`.

4. **Updating the Last Year**:
   - After calculating the next year for each sign, `last_year` is updated to `next_year`.

5. **Storing Results**:
   - The final year when the nth sign occurs is stored in the `results` list as a string.

6. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program writes the results to the standard output, each on a new line.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `3 2 4 5 9 18`
  - `last_year` starts at 3.
  - For `a[1] = 2`: `next_year = (3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4`
  - For `a[2] = 4`: `next_year = (4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8`
  - For `a[3] = 5`: `next_year = (8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10`
  - For `a[4] = 9`: `next_year = (10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18`
  - For `a[5] = 18`: `next_year = (18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36`
  - Output: `36`

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `1 2 3 4 5`
  - `last_year` starts at 1.
  - For `a[1] = 2`: `next_year = (1 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 2`
  - For `a[2] = 3`: `next_year = (2 + 1 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 3`
  - For `a[3] = 4`: `next_year = (3 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 4`
  - For `a[4] = 5`: `next_year = (4 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 5`
  - Output: `5`

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `1 1 1 1 1`
  - `last_year` starts at 1.
  - For `a[1] = 1`: `next_year = (1 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 2`
  - For `a[2] = 1`: `next_year = (2 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 3`
  - For `a[3] = 1`: `next_year = (3 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 4`
  - For `a[4] = 1`: `next_year = (4 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 5`
  - Output: `5`

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input: `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
  - `last_year` starts at 50.
  - For `a[1] = 30`: `next_year = (50 + 1 + 30 - 1) // 30 * 30 = 60`
  - For `a[2] = 711`: `next_year = (60 + 1 + 711 - 1) // 711 * 711 = 711`
  - For `a[3] = 200`: `next_year = (711 + 1 + 200 - 1) // 200 * 200 = 800`
  - For `a[4] = 503`: `next_year = (800 + 1 + 503 - 1) // 503 * 503 = 1006`
  - For `a[5] = 1006`: `next_year = (1006 + 1 + 1006 - 1) // 1006 * 1006 = 2012`
  - Output: `2012`
