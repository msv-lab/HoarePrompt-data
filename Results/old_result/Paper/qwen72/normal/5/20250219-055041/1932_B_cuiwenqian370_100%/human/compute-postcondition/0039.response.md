Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `results` includes the string representation of the original `last_year` and the updated `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_`, `index` is incremented by `n`.**

Explanation:
- The `results` list now includes the string representation of the original `last_year` and the updated `last_year`.
- The value of `last_year` remains the same after the code execution, as it is only being appended to the `results` list.
- The value of `next_year` is not affected by the code snippet.
- The value of `_` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `index` is incremented by `n`.
- The values of `a`, `n`, `i`, and `T` remain unchanged.
