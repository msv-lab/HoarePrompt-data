The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables that are part of the loop head and can be adjusted are `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2

The other variables and conditions (`a`, `last_year`, `next_year`, `results`, `_`, `T`, and `index`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1]) * a[1]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1]) * a[1]`, `results` includes the string representation of the original `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_`, `index` is incremented by `n`**
