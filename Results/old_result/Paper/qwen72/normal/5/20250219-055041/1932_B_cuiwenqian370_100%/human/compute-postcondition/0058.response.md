Output State: **The loop has completed all `T` iterations. `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]` from the last iteration, `a` is the list of `n` integers from the last iteration, `last_year` is the final computed value for the last iteration, `next_year` is the same as `last_year` from the last iteration, `results` is a list containing the string representations of the final `last_year` values from each of the `T` iterations, `index` is `1 + T + sum(n for each iteration)`, `_` is `T - 1`, and the string representations of the `results` list are printed, each on a new line, followed by a newline character.**
