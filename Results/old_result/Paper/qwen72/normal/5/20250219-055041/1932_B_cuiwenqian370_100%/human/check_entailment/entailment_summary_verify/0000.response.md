### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach for handling input, especially when the input is large and needs to be processed efficiently.
   - The variable `index` is used to keep track of the current position in the input data list. This is a good practice to ensure that the input is read correctly and in the correct order.

2. **Test Case Processing:**
   - The program processes each test case by reading the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - The initial year for the first sign is set to `a[0]`, which is correct according to the problem description.

3. **Sequential Sign Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the next year for each sign using the formula `next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
     - This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
     - The expression `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i]` calculates the smallest integer greater than or equal to `(last_year + 1) / a[i]`.
     - Multiplying this result by `a[i]` gives the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
   - This logic is consistent with the problem's requirement that signs must occur sequentially and strictly after the previous sign.

4. **Output Handling:**
   - The results are stored in a list `results` and written to `sys.stdout` at the end of the program. This is a valid way to handle output, especially when dealing with multiple test cases.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `a[i]` is 1, which means the sign occurs every year. In such cases, the next year will be `last_year + 1`, which is correct.
   - The program also handles cases where the periodicities are large (up to \(10^6\)) and the number of signs is up to 100, as specified in the problem constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and the function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program. The program reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the correct year for the n-th sign to occur, ensuring that the signs occur sequentially and strictly after the previous sign.

Final: **True**
