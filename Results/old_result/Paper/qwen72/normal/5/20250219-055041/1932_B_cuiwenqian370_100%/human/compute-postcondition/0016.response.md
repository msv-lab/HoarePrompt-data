Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1]) * a[1]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2]) * a[2]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `next_year` is updated to `((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2]) * a[2]`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, and `last_year` remain unchanged.
- The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1]) * a[1]`. These conditions are still valid after the code execution.
