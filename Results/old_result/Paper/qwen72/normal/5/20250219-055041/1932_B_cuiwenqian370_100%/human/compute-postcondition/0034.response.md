Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2]) * a[2]`, `results` includes the string representation of the original `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_`, `index` is incremented by `n`.**

The value of `last_year` is updated to be equal to `next_year`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
