The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `_` being less than `T`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is incremented by 1, and `T` must be greater than `_`.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `results` includes the string representation of the original `last_year` and the updated `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_`, `index` is incremented by `n`**

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `T` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `results` includes the string representation of the original `last_year` and the updated `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_`, `index` is incremented by `n`**

After adjusting:
- `_` is incremented by 1, so `_` is now `_ + 1`.
- `T` must be greater than `_ + 1`.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `results` includes the string representation of the original `last_year` and the updated `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_ + 1`, `index` is incremented by `n`**
