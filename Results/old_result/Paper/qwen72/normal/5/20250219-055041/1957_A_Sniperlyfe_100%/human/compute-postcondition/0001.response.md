The only objects in the loop head are the variable `n` and the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one inner list. The variable `n` will be the first inner list in `arr` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 inner list, `n` is the first inner list in `arr`, `freq` is an empty dictionary**
