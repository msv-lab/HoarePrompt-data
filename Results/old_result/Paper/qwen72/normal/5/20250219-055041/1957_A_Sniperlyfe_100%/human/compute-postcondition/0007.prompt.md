Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the lengths of sticks for a test case. The length of `arr` is between 1 and 100, inclusive, and each inner list contains between 1 and 100 integers, inclusive, with each integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. `freq` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for n in arr:
    freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 inner list, `n` is the first inner list in `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with `n` as a key and the value 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 inner lists, `n` is the second inner list in `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with the first inner list as a key and the value 1, and `n` as a key with the value 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 inner lists, `n` is the third inner list in `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with the first inner list as a key and the value 1, and `n` as a key with the value 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
