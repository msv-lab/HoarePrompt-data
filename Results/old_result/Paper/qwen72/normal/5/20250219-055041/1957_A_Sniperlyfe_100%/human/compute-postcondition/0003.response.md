The only objects in the loop head are the list `arr` and the variable `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 inner lists, the loop can execute again for the second inner list. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 inner list, `n` is the first inner list in `arr`, and `freq` is a dictionary with `n` as a key and the value 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 2 inner lists, and `n` will be the second inner list in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 inner lists, `n` is the second inner list in `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with the first inner list as a key and the value 1.**
