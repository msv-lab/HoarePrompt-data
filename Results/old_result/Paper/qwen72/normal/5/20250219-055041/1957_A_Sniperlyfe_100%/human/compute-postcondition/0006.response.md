Output State: **`arr` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 inner lists, `n` is the third inner list in `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with the first inner list as a key and the value 1, and `n` as a key with the value 3.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `freq[n]` by incrementing it by 1.
- Initially, `freq[n]` is 2.
- After executing the code, `freq[n]` becomes 3.
- The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.
