To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```
while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1\) is less than or equal to `number`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `size` is increased by 1.
   - `number` is in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `number` is at least 3.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `size` will be increased by 1 again.
   - The loop condition will then be \((1 << (size + 2)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\).

4. **Adjustments**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `size`.
   - The condition \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\) must hold true for the loop to execute one more time.
   - Since `size` is increased by 1, the new condition will be \((1 << (size + 2)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\).

5. **Ensuring the Loop Condition**:
   - To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `number` must be large enough to satisfy the new condition.
   - Given that `number` is at least 3, we need to check if \((1 << (size + 2)) - 1\) is less than or equal to `number`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The loop condition depends on `size` and `number`.
   - Since `size` is increased by 1, the new condition \((1 << (size + 2)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\) must hold true.
   - No other states need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`size` is increased by 1, `number` is in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\) and `number` is at least 3, and \((1 << (size + 2)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\)**
