You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

import sys
from typing import Any, List

stdin = sys.stdin
stdout = sys.stdout
test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(test_cases):
    n = int(input())
    result = list()

    Args:

        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence

    """
    assert number >= 0
    if number == 0:
        return 0
    size = 1
    while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
        size += 1
    for i in range(size):
        sequence.append(i)
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
        sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
    return size + result



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. If `number` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest integer `size` such that \((1 << size) - 1 > \text{number}\), appends integers from 0 to `size - 1` to `sequence`, and recursively calls itself with a modified `number` and the modified `sequence`. The function returns the sum of `size` and the result of the recursive call. Additionally, the `sequence` list is modified such that each element at index `size - result - 1 - i` for each `i` from 0 to `size - 1` is incremented by the result of the recursive call.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `X = 1` correctly. According to the problem description, `X` can be as low as 2, but if we consider the edge case where `X = 1`, the program should ideally return an array with exactly one element (since an array with one element has exactly one increasing subsequence, which is the element itself). However, the program will return an array of length 0, which is incorrect. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where `X` is a power of 2 minus 1 (e.g., 3, 7, 15, etc.) correctly. For example, when `X = 3`, the program should generate an array with exactly 3 increasing subsequences, but it fails to do so. 

For a more concrete example, consider the input `X = 3`. The program should generate an array with exactly 3 increasing subsequences. However, the output of the program for `X = 3` is:
```
3
0 1 0
```
This array has more than 3 increasing subsequences: `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0]`, `[0, 1]`, `[1, 0]`, and `[0, 1, 0]`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for this input.
