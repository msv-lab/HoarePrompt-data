Reasoning:

The program aims to generate an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The approach taken by the program is to use a recursive function `func_1` to build the sequence. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Base Case**:
   - If `number` (which is \( X - 1 \)) is 0, the function returns 0. This means that the sequence is empty, which is correct because an empty sequence has exactly 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence itself).

2. **Recursive Case**:
   - The function calculates the smallest integer `size` such that \( (1 << size) - 1 > \text{number} \). This is equivalent to finding the smallest \( k \) such that \( 2^k - 1 > \text{number} \). This step is crucial because it determines the number of elements to add to the sequence to ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is close to the target.
   - The function then appends integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the sequence. This step ensures that the sequence has a certain number of elements that can form increasing subsequences.
   - The function recursively calls itself with the modified `number` (i.e., `number - (1 << size) + 1`). This step is intended to adjust the number of increasing subsequences to exactly match the target.
   - After the recursive call, the function modifies the sequence by incrementing certain elements based on the result of the recursive call. This is done to ensure that the sequence has the correct number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself for each test case. If the sequence is empty, it prints -1.

4. **Assertions**:
   - The assertions in the loop ensure that the indices being modified are valid and within the bounds of the sequence.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm is designed to build a sequence that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The key idea is to use the properties of binary numbers and the combinatorial nature of increasing subsequences.
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the smallest `size` such that the number of increasing subsequences is close to the target, and then it recursively adjusts the sequence to match the target exactly.
   - The modifications to the sequence ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is correctly counted and adjusted.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `number` is 0 by returning 0, which is correct.
   - The program also ensures that the sequence length does not exceed 200 and that the elements are within the specified range.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct in its approach and implementation. It correctly generates a sequence that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for the given range of \( X \).

Correctness: **True**
