    #The program returns the sum of `size` and `result`, where `size` is the length of the `sequence` list, and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`. The `sequence` list has been modified such that each element at index `size - result - 1 - i` for each `i` from 0 to `size - 1` is now `sequence[size - result - 1 - i] + result`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. If `number` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest integer `size` such that \((1 << size) - 1 > \text{number}\), appends integers from 0 to `size - 1` to `sequence`, and recursively calls itself with a modified `number` and the modified `sequence`. The function returns the sum of `size` and the result of the recursive call. Additionally, the `sequence` list is modified such that each element at index `size - result - 1 - i` for each `i` from 0 to `size - 1` is incremented by the result of the recursive call.
