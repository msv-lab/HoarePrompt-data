### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to generate an array of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array that are strictly increasing and maintain their relative order.
   - The array elements should be within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) (which is \( X \) in the problem statement).
   - It initializes an empty list `result` to store the sequence and calls the function `func_1` with \( n - 1 \) and the `result` list.
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for generating the sequence and returning its size.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Base Case**: If `number` is 0, the function returns 0. This is correct because an array with 0 elements has exactly 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence).
   - **Finding the Size**:
     - The function calculates the smallest `size` such that \( (1 << size) - 1 > \text{number} \). This is equivalent to finding the smallest power of 2 greater than `number + 1`.
     - This step is crucial because it helps in breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.
   - **Appending Elements**:
     - The function appends integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the `sequence` list.
     - This ensures that the sequence is initially strictly increasing.
   - **Recursive Call**:
     - The function makes a recursive call to `func_1` with the updated `number` and the same `sequence` list.
     - The updated `number` is \( \text{number} - (1 << size) + 1 \). This is because the current `size` contributes \( (1 << size) - 1 \) increasing subsequences.
   - **Modifying the Sequence**:
     - After the recursive call, the function modifies the last `result` elements of the `sequence` by adding `result` to them.
     - This step ensures that the sequence remains strictly increasing and the number of increasing subsequences is correctly adjusted.
   - **Return Value**:
     - The function returns the sum of `size` and `result`. This is the total length of the sequence generated so far.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the `result` list and the elements of the list.
   - If the function returns -1, it prints -1, indicating that no such array exists.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints \( 2 \leq X \leq 10^{18} \) and \( 1 \leq t \leq 1000 \).
   - The sequence length is at most 200, and the elements are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate an array with exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for the given constraints. The logic for breaking down the problem and modifying the sequence to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences is sound.

**Correctness: True**
