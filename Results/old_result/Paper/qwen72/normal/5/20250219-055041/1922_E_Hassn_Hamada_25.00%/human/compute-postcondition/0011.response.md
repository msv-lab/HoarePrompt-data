Output State: **`size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << size) - 1 > \text{number}\), and `number` remains in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\).**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, the variable `size` will be the smallest integer for which the expression \((1 << size) - 1\) is greater than the given `number`. The value of `number` remains unchanged throughout the loop, and it still falls within the initial range of \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\).
