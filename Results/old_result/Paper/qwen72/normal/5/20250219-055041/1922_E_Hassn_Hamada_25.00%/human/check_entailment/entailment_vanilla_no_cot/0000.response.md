Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It generates an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences for a given X. The logic in `func_1` is designed to construct the array by recursively breaking down the number of required subsequences into smaller parts, and then adjusting the elements of the array to ensure the correct count of increasing subsequences. The assertions and the logic for adjusting the elements of the array in the recursive function call are consistent with the problem requirements, and the program handles the constraints and edge cases as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
