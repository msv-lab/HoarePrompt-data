Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `size - 1`, `number` remains in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `size - 1`, but each element at index `size - result - 1 - i` for each `i` from 0 to `size - 1` is now `sequence[size - result - 1 - i] + result`, and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all `size` iterations.
- The variable `i` has reached the value `size - 1`.
- The variable `number` remains within the specified range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\).
- The list `sequence` initially contained integers from 0 to `size - 1`. After the loop, each element at the index `size - result - 1 - i` (for each `i` from 0 to `size - 1`) has been incremented by the value of `result`.
- The value of `result` is determined by the function `func_1` using the adjusted `number` and the modified `sequence` after each iteration.
