The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, and `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `a` is a 4xN list of integers where N is the number of integers input on each line, `x` is a list containing the first element of each sublist in `a`, `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.**
