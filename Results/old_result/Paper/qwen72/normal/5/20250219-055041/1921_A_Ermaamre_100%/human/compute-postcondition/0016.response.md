Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is `t-1`, `a` is a 4xN list of integers where N is the number of integers input on each line, `x` is a list containing the first element of each sublist in `a`, `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `t` remains greater than 0. The variable `_` has the value `t-1`, which is the last value it takes before the loop finishes. The variable `a` is a 4xN list of integers, where N is the number of integers input on each line, and this list is updated in each iteration to store the coordinates of the corners of the current square. The variable `x` is a list containing the first element (the x-coordinate) of each sublist in `a`, and `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`, representing the side length of the square. The loop prints the square of `dx` for each set of coordinates, which is the area of the square.
