Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `a` is a 4xN list of integers where N is the number of integers input on each line, `x` is a list containing the first element of each sublist in `a`, `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.**

The code snippet updates the value of `a` to a 4xN list of integers, where each sublist contains integers input on each line. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The list `x` is updated to contain the first element of each sublist in `a`, and `dx` is updated to the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.
