Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading four lines of input, each containing the coordinates of a corner of the square. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Coordinate Extraction**: The function extracts the x-coordinates from the list of points and calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx`). This is a valid approach to determine the side length of the square, given that the sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.

3. **Area Calculation**: The area of the square is calculated as `dx * dx`, which is correct since the side length of the square is `dx`.

4. **Output**: The function prints the area of the square for each test case, which matches the required output format.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles the edge cases correctly. For example, if the coordinates are given in a different order, the calculation of `dx` will still yield the correct side length because it uses the maximum and minimum values.

6. **Constraints**: The function respects the constraints provided in the problem description, such as the range of `t` and the coordinates.

Given this reasoning, the function appears to be correct and should work as intended for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
