The code snippet `x = [p[0] for p in a]` updates the list `x` to contain the first element of each sublist in `a`. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `dx`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `a` is a 4xN list of integers where N is the number of integers input on each line, `x` is a list containing the first element of each sublist in `a`, `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the updated `x`.**
