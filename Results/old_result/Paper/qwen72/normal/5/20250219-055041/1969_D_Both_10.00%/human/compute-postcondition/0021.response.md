Functionality: ** The function `func_3` accepts two lists of tuples, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, and returns a single integer. The integer is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the first and second elements is greater than or equal to 0. The input lists `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged after the function call. **
