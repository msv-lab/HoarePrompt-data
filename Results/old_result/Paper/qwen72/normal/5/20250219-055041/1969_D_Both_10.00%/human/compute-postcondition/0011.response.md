Postcondition: ***`sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`. If the sum of the first and second elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0, `sub_summ` is updated to include this sum, and `sec_arr` remains unchanged. `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, and `main_ar` must have at least one element, with `val_b` being the first element in `main_ar`.***
