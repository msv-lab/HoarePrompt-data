Initial State: `main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The integers in the tuples represent item prices for Alice and Bob, respectively.
```
sub_summ = 0
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The variable `sub_summ` is initialized to 0. The lists `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged. The integers in the tuples within these lists still represent item prices for Alice and Bob, respectively.

Output State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing item prices for Alice and Bob, respectively. `sub_summ` is 0.**
