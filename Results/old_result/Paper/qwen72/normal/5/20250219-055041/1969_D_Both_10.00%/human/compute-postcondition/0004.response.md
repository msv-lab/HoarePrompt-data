Output State: **`sub_summ` is equal to `2 * val_a[0]`, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `val_a` is the second tuple in `sec_arr`.** 

Explanation: The value of `sub_summ` was initially equal to `val_a[0]`. After executing the code `sub_summ += val_a[0]`, `sub_summ` is now equal to `2 * val_a[0]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
