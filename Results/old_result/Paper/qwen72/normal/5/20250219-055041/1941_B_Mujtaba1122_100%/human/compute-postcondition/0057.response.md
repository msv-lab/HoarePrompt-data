Postcondition: **The list is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is `n-1`, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, and for all `j` in the range `2` to `n-2`, `list[j]` is 0. The value of `list[n-1]` is the original value of `list[n-1]` minus the sum of all the values that were originally in `list[2]` to `list[n-2]` multiplied by 1, and `list[n-2]` is 0. The function `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`.**
