Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 4, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is 0, `list[3]` is `list[3] - 2 * list[2]`, `list[4]` is `list[4] - list[2] - list[2]`, `list[4]` must be greater than 1, `list[5]` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` updates the value of `list[5]` by subtracting `list[3]` from it.
- Since `i` is 4, `i + 1` is 5, and `i - 1` is 3.
- `list[3]` is already defined as `list[3] - 2 * list[2]`, and since `list[2]` is 0, `list[3]` is simply `list[3]`.
- `list[4]` is defined as `list[4] - list[2]`, and since `list[2]` is 0, `list[4]` is simply `list[4]`.
- The value of `list[5]` is updated by subtracting `list[3]` from it, which is `list[3] - 2 * list[2]` (but since `list[2]` is 0, this is just `list[3]`).
- Therefore, `list[5]` is now `list[5] - list[3]`.
- The value of `list[4]` is updated to `list[4] - list[2] - list[2]`, which simplifies to `list[4] - 0 - 0`, so `list[4]` remains `list[4] - list[2]`.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
