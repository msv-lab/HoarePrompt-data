To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop head:

1. `list[i] > 1`
2. `list[i - 1] > 0`
3. `list[i + 1] > 0`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5)
- `i` is 1
- `list[0]` is 0 (since `list[0]` is `list[0] - list[0]`)
- `list[1]` is `list[1] - 2 * list[0]` (which simplifies to `list[1]` because `list[0]` is 0)
- `list[2]` is `list[2] - list[0]` (which simplifies to `list[2]` because `list[0]` is 0)

Now, let's check the conditions with the current state:
1. `list[i] > 1` translates to `list[1] > 1` (since `i` is 1).
2. `list[i - 1] > 0` translates to `list[0] > 0` (since `i` is 1 and `i - 1` is 0). However, `list[0]` is 0, so this condition is not met.
3. `list[i + 1] > 0` translates to `list[2] > 0` (since `i` is 1 and `i + 1` is 2).

Since the second condition `list[i - 1] > 0` is not met (because `list[0]` is 0), the loop will not execute again. To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust the state so that `list[0]` is greater than 0.

However, the only variables we can adjust are those in the loop head, which are `list[i]`, `list[i - 1]`, and `list[i + 1]`. Since `i` is 1, we can adjust `list[0]`, `list[1]`, and `list[2]`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
- `list[0]` must be greater than 0.
- `list[1]` must be greater than 1.
- `list[2]` must be greater than 0.

Given the current state, we need to adjust `list[0]` to be greater than 0. The other conditions (`list[1] > 1` and `list[2] > 0`) should remain as they are.

State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 1, `list[0]` must be greater than 0, `list[1]` is `list[1] - 2 * list[0]` (which simplifies to `list[1]` if `list[0]` is greater than 0), `list[2]` is `list[2] - list[0]` (which simplifies to `list[2]` if `list[0]` is greater than 0)**
