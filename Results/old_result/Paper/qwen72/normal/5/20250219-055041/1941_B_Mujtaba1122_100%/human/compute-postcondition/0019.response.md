To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop head:

1. `list[i] > 1`
2. `list[i - 1] > 0`
3. `list[i + 1] > 0`

Given the state right before the loop:
- `list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5)
- `i` is 3
- `list[0]` is 0
- `list[1]` is 0
- `list[2]` is 0
- `list[3]` is `list[3] - list[1]` (which simplifies to `list[3]` since `list[1]` is 0)
- `list[i - 1]` is 0 (which means `list[2]` is 0)

Let's evaluate each condition:
1. `list[i] > 1` (which means `list[3] > 1`)
   - `list[3]` must be greater than 1.
2. `list[i - 1] > 0` (which means `list[2] > 0`)
   - `list[2]` must be greater than 0. However, the given state says `list[2]` is 0, so this condition cannot be met.
3. `list[i + 1] > 0` (which means `list[4] > 0`)
   - `list[4]` must be greater than 0.

To ensure the first iteration of the loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state of `list[2]` to be greater than 0. The other conditions (`list[3] > 1` and `list[4] > 0`) should also be met, but they are not directly specified in the initial state.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `list[2]` must be greater than 0.
- `list[3]` must be greater than 1.
- `list[4]` must be greater than 0.

State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 3, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` must be greater than 0, `list[3]` must be greater than 1, and `list[4]` must be greater than 0**
