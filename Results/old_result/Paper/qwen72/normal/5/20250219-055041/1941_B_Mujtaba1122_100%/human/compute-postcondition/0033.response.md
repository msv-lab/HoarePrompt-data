Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` where \(3 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - The first five elements of the list are explicitly given as:
     - `list[0]` is 0
     - `list[1]` is 0
     - `list[2]` is 0
     - `list[3]` is 0
     - `list[4]` is 0
   - `list[5]` is defined as `list[5] - list[3]`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - The current value of `list[i - 1]` (which is `list[2]`) is not 0.

2. **Contradiction in the Initial State:**
   - According to the initial state, `list[2]` is explicitly stated to be 0.
   - However, it is also stated that the current value of `list[2]` is not 0.
   - This is a contradiction because `list[2]` cannot be both 0 and not 0 at the same time.

3. **Implications:**
   - Since the initial state contains a contradiction, it is impossible to determine the exact values of the elements in the list based on the given information.
   - However, the code snippet itself does not depend on the values of the list elements; it simply prints a string.

4. **Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet is:
     ```python
     print('no')
     ```

5. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string 'no' regardless of the values in the list.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **no**
