Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 1, `list[0]` is `list[0] - list[0]` (which means `list[0]` is 0), `list[1]` is `list[1] - 2 * list[0]`, `list[2]` is `list[2] - list[0]`**

Explanation:
- The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` is executed.
- Since `i` is 1, `i - 1` is 0.
- `list[0]` is updated to `list[0] - 1 * list[0]`, which simplifies to `list[0] - list[0]`, resulting in `list[0]` being 0.
- The values of `list[1]` and `list[2]` remain as `list[1] - 2 * list[0]` and `list[2] - list[0]` respectively, since they were already defined in the initial state.
- The length of the list and the value of `i` remain unchanged.
