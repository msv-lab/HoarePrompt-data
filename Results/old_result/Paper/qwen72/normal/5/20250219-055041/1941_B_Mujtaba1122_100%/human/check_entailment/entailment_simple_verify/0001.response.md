### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero by repeatedly applying an operation that modifies three consecutive elements.
   - The operation is defined as: for any index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)), the elements \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) are decreased by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(list, n)`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call. The function works as intended.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(list, n)`**:
   - This function attempts to apply the operation to the array to make all elements zero.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to \( n-2 \) (i.e., the middle elements).
   - For each index \( i \), it checks if the elements \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) are greater than 0 and \( a_i \) is greater than 1.
   - If the conditions are met, it applies the operation by decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, scaled by the value of \( a_{i-1} \).
   - **Annotation Verification**: The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call. However, the implementation of the operation is incorrect.

4. **Analysis of the Algorithm**:
   - **Scaling Issue**: The operation should decrement \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, not by \( a_{i-1} \). This scaling can lead to incorrect results.
   - **Condition Issue**: The condition `list[i] > 1` is too restrictive. The operation can be applied as long as \( a_i \) is at least 2 and the neighboring elements are positive.
   - **Edge Case Handling**: The function does not handle cases where the operation cannot be applied due to insufficient values in the neighboring elements. For example, if \( a_i \) is 2 but \( a_{i-1} \) or \( a_{i+1} \) is 0, the operation should not be applied.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The provided program has logical errors in the way it applies the operation and checks the conditions.
   - The scaling by \( a_{i-1} \) in the operation is incorrect and can lead to invalid results.
   - The condition `list[i] > 1` is too restrictive and may prevent valid operations from being applied.
   - The function does not handle edge cases where the operation cannot be applied due to insufficient values in the neighboring elements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is incorrect due to the issues in the way the operation is applied and the conditions checked. A correct solution would need to apply the operation correctly and handle all edge cases.

Final: **False**
