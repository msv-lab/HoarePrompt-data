Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 4, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is 0, `list[3]` is `list[3] - 2 * list[2]` - `list[3]`, `list[4]` is `list[4] - 2 * list[3]`, `list[4]` must be greater than 1, `list[5]` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` is executed.
- `i` is 4, so `i - 1` is 3.
- `list[3]` is updated to `list[3] - 1 * list[3]`, which simplifies to `list[3] - list[3]` or `0`.
- The initial value of `list[3]` was `list[3] - 2 * list[2]`, and since `list[2]` is 0, `list[3]` was initially `list[3]`.
- After the update, `list[3]` is now 0.
- The values of `list[0]`, `list[1]`, `list[2]`, `list[4]`, and `list[5]` remain unchanged.
- The conditions that `list[4]` must be greater than 1 and `list[5]` must be greater than 0 are still valid.
