### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero by repeatedly applying an operation that modifies three consecutive elements.
   - The operation is defined as: for any index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)), the elements \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) are decreased by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(list, n)`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correct and works as intended.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(list, n)`**:
   - This function attempts to apply the operation to the array to make all elements zero.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to \( n-2 \) (i.e., the middle elements).
   - For each index \( i \), it checks if the elements \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) are greater than 0 and \( a_i \) is greater than 1.
   - If the conditions are met, it applies the operation by decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, scaled by the value of \( a_{i-1} \).
   - This scaling by \( a_{i-1} \) is incorrect. The operation should only decrement by 1, 2, and 1, not by \( a_{i-1} \).
   - The condition `list[i] > 1` is too restrictive. The operation can be applied as long as \( a_i \) is at least 2 and the neighboring elements are positive.
   - The function does not handle cases where the operation cannot be applied due to insufficient values in the neighboring elements.
   - The function also prints "no" and returns immediately if \( a_{i-1} \) becomes non-zero, which is not the correct approach. It should continue to check the entire array and only print "NO" if it cannot make all elements zero.

4. **Analysis of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm attempts to reduce the elements of the array by applying the operation in a greedy manner.
   - However, the scaling by \( a_{i-1} \) in the operation is incorrect and can lead to invalid results.
   - The condition `list[i] > 1` is too restrictive and may prevent valid operations from being applied.
   - The function does not handle edge cases where the operation cannot be applied due to insufficient values in the neighboring elements.
   - The function also does not correctly handle the case where the operation cannot be applied to the last element of the array.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program has logical errors in the way it applies the operation and checks the conditions. Specifically, the scaling by \( a_{i-1} \) and the restrictive condition `list[i] > 1` are incorrect. Additionally, the function does not handle edge cases properly.

Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect and needs to be revised to correctly apply the operation and handle all edge cases.
