Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` within the range 3 to 200,000. It modifies the list such that, after execution, the first two elements (`list[0]` and `list[1]`) are 0, and all elements from index 2 to `n-2` are also 0. The last element (`list[n-1]`) is reduced by the sum of the original values from index 2 to `n-2`. The function then calls another function `func_1` with the modified list and `n`. If `func_1` returns `True`, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. **
