The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `size`, and `overlap`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < size - overlap`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\)
- `sequence` is a list of integers that contains `[0]`
- `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\)
- `i` is 0
- `overlap` is 0

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1.
- The condition `i < size - overlap` must still be true for the loop to execute again. Since `i` is now 1, `size - overlap` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers that contains `[0]`, `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\), `i` is 1, `overlap` is 0, `size - overlap` must be greater than 1**
