Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers that will be the output of the function, `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\), `i` is the largest integer in the range of the loop for which the condition `value <= number` is true, `overlap` is no longer defined.**
