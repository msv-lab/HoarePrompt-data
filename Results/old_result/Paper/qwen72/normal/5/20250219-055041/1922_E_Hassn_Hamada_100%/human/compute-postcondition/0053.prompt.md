Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers that will be the output of the function, `size_overlap` is (0, 0).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):
    size, value = i + 1, (1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)
    while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
        size += 1
        value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)
    if value <= number:
        size_overlap = size, i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\), `value` is \((1 << size) - (1 << i)\). If `value` is less than or equal to `number`, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing the values of `size` and `i`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without modifying `size_overlap`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > number\), `value` is \((1 << size) - (1 << i)\), and `i` is `i - 1` (where `i - 1` is greater than or equal to `-1`). If `value` is less than or equal to `number`, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `size` and `i - 1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without modifying `size_overlap`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`size` is the smallest integer such that `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) > number`, `i` remains unchanged, `value` is `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`. If `value` is less than or equal to `number`, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing the values of `size` and `i`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
