To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration:

Loop head:
```
for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):
```

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\)
- `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\)
- `value` is \((1 << size) - (1 << i)\)
- If `value` is less than or equal to `number`, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing the values of `size` and `i`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without modifying `size_overlap`.

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The loop iterates over `i` from `max(sequence, default=0)` down to `-1` in steps of `-1`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has a certain value.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1.
4. The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is some integer.
- The loop will continue if `i - 1` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `i - 1`.
- The loop will continue if `i - 1 >= -1`.

State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\), `value` is \((1 << size) - (1 << i)\), `i` is `i - 1`, and `i - 1` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.**
