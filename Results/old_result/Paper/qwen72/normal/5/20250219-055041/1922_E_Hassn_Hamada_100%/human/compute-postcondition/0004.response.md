Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers that will be the output of the function, `size_overlap` is (0, 0).** 

The `number` and `sequence` variables remain unchanged. The `size_overlap` variable is now a tuple with both elements set to 0.
