Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers that will be the output of the function and now contains `[0]`, `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\), `i` is 0, `overlap` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `sequence.append(i + overlap)` appends the value of `i + overlap` to the list `sequence`. Since `i` is 0 and `overlap` is 0, the value appended to `sequence` is 0. Therefore, `sequence` now contains the single element `[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
