Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers that contains `[0, 1, 2, ..., size - 1]`, `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\), `i` is `size - 1`, `overlap` is 0, `size - overlap` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and `func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)` has been called.**

The function `func_1` is called with the arguments `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)` and `sequence`. The values of `number`, `sequence`, `size`, `i`, and `overlap` remain unchanged. The specific impact of `func_1` is not described, but it has been invoked with the given arguments.
