Output State: **`size` is `i + 5`, `i` is `i + 1`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 5)) - (1 << (i + 1))`**

Explanation:
- The initial state indicates that `i` is already greater than or equal to `0`, and `size` is `i + 4`.
- The code snippet `size += 1` increments `size` by 1.
- Since `size` was initially `i + 4`, after the increment, `size` becomes `i + 5`.
- The value of `i` is also incremented by 1 to ensure the loop condition holds.
- The `value` is recalculated as `(1 << (i + 5)) - (1 << (i + 1))`, reflecting the updated values of `i` and `size`.
