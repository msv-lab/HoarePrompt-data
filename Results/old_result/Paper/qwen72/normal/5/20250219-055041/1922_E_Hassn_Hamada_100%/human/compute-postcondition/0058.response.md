Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers that contains `[0, 1]`, `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\), `i` is 1, `overlap` is 0, `size - overlap` must be greater than 1.**

The value of `i + overlap` is 1, and this value is appended to the `sequence` list, which initially contains `[0]`. Therefore, the `sequence` list now contains `[0, 1]`. The values of `number`, `size`, `i`, and `overlap` remain unchanged, and the condition `size - overlap` must be greater than 1 still holds true.
