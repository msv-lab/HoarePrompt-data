Output State: **`size` is the smallest integer such that `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) > number`, `i` remains unchanged, `value` is `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`size`**: The loop continues to increment `size` until the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) > number` is no longer satisfied. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `size` will be the smallest integer for which this condition holds true.
- **`i`**: The variable `i` remains unchanged throughout the loop because it is not modified within the loop body.
- **`value`**: The variable `value` is updated in each iteration to be `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`. After the loop finishes, `value` will be the last computed value before the condition failed, which is `(1 << size) - (1 << i)` where `size` is the final value determined by the loop.
