The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop index, and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
