Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is 0 (though it is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer, and it is less than or equal to `a`.
- `k` is 0 (though it is not used in the code snippet).

The code snippet is:
```python
print(a * n)
```

This code will print the product of `a` and `n`. Since `a` and `n` are both input integers, and `n` is greater than 0, the output will be the result of multiplying `a` by `n`.

Output: **a * n (where a is the input integer and n is an input integer greater than 0)**
