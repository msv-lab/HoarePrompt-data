You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates and prints a result based on these inputs. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the result is `a * n`. Otherwise, the result is `((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2) * k + (n - k) * a`, where `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that `t` lines of output have been printed, each corresponding to the result of a test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob can sell `n` buns.
   - The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
   - The first `k` buns can be sold at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.
   - We need to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price without the modified price dropping below the usual price `a`.
   - If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit is `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, it calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price.
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated as `((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2) * k`. This is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `(b - k + 1)`.
   - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.

3. **Checking the Arithmetic Series Calculation:**
   - The sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `(b - k + 1)` is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{k \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})}{2}
     \]
   - Substituting the values, we get:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{k \times (b + (b - k + 1))}{2} = \frac{k \times (2b - k + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - The program uses the formula `((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2) * k`, which is equivalent to the above formula.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `b <= a`, the program correctly outputs `a * n` because the modified price is not beneficial.
   - If `b > a`, the program correctly calculates the profit from the first `k` buns and the remaining `n - k` buns.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The program runs in O(1) time for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns. It handles all edge cases and uses the correct arithmetic series formula.

### Correctness:
**True**
