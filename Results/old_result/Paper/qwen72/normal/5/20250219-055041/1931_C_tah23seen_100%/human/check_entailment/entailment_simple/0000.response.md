### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.
   - **Initial Setup:**
     - `i` is initialized to 0, which is the starting index of the array.
     - `j` is initialized to `len(arr) - 1`, which is the last index of the array.
   - **First While Loop:**
     - The loop `while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` increments `i` until it finds the first index where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
     - This loop effectively finds the first position where the array elements differ from the start.
   - **Second While Loop:**
     - The loop `while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` decrements `j` until it finds the first index where `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[j - 1]`.
     - This loop effectively finds the last position where the array elements differ from the end.
   - **Condition Check:**
     - If `arr[0] == arr[-1]`, it means the first and last elements of the array are the same. In this case, the minimum cost is the length of the segment between `i` and `j` minus 1, or 0 if `i` and `j` are the same.
     - If `arr[0] != arr[-1]`, it means the first and last elements are different. The minimum cost is the minimum of the length of the segment from `i` to the end of the array (`n - i - 1`) and the length of the segment from the start of the array to `j` (`j`).

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all elements in the array are the same, the program correctly returns 0.
   - If the array has only one element, the program correctly returns 0.
   - If the array has two elements and they are different, the program correctly returns 1.

4. **Complexity:**
   - The program runs in linear time, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
