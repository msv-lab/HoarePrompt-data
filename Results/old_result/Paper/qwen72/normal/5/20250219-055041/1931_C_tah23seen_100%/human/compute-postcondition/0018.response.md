Output State: **The program returns the maximum of 0 and the difference between `j` and `i` minus 1, where `j` is the largest index such that `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[j - 1]` and `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`. If all elements in `arr` are equal, `j` is 0 and `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.**
