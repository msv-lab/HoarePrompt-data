Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where the minimum cost to make all elements equal is achieved by selecting a value that is not at the start or end of the array. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`. The correct answer should be 1 (by setting the middle three elements to 1 or 2), but the program will return 0, as it incorrectly assumes that the minimum cost is always related to the first or last element being the same.
