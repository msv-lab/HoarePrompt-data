Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j, where n is the length of the list `arr`, i is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal, and j is the largest index such that `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[j - 1]` and `j` is greater than 0, or 0 if all elements in `arr` are equal.**
