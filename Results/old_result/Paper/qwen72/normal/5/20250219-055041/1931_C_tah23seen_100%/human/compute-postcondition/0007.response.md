To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `i`
   - `len(arr)`

2. **Current State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` is equal to the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `j` is equal to `n - 1`.
   - `arr[2]` must be equal to `arr[3]`.

3. **Loop Condition Breakdown:**
   - `i < len(arr) - 1`: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`: For the loop to execute one more time, `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `len(arr)` is `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `arr[2]` must be equal to `arr[3]`.

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For `i < len(arr) - 1` to be true, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is 3, `n - 1` must be greater than 3, which means `n` must be greater than 4.
   - For `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` to be true, `arr[3]` must be equal to `arr[4]`.

### Conclusion:
- The current state already satisfies `i < len(arr) - 1` because `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 4.
- The current state also satisfies `arr[2] == arr[3]`, but we need to ensure that `arr[3] == arr[4]` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
- `i` is 3.
- `n` must be greater than 4.
- `arr[3]` must be equal to `arr[4]`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr). `i` is 3. `n` is equal to the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 4. `j` is equal to `n - 1`. `arr[3]` must be equal to `arr[4]`.**
