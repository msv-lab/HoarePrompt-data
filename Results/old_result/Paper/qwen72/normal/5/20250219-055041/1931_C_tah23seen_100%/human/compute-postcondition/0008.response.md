Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr). `i` is 4. `n` is equal to the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 4. `j` is equal to `n - 1`. `arr[3]` must be equal to `arr[4]`.**

The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, changing from 3 to 4. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
