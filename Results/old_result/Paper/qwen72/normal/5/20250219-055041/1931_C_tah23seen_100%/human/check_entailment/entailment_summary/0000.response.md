Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal by performing at most one operation that assigns a value to a subarray. The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray being assigned the value.

The function `func_1` works as follows:
1. It initializes two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
2. It moves the pointer `i` to the right as long as the elements at `i` and `i + 1` are the same.
3. It moves the pointer `j` to the left as long as the elements at `j` and `j - 1` are the same.
4. If the first and last elements of the array are the same, it returns the maximum of 0 and the length of the subarray between `i` and `j` (exclusive), minus 1. This is because if the first and last elements are the same, the subarray between them can be made equal with a single operation.
5. If the first and last elements are different, it returns the maximum of 0 and the minimum of the lengths of the subarrays from `i` to the end and from the start to `j`. This is because the optimal strategy is to either assign the value of the first element to the subarray from `i` to the end or assign the value of the last element to the subarray from the start to `j`.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the case where the array has multiple distinct values and the optimal subarray to assign a value to is not necessarily from the start or the end. The function should instead find the most frequent value in the array and calculate the minimum cost to make all elements equal to that value.

For example, consider the array `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`. The function `func_1` will incorrectly return 6, but the correct answer is 4, which can be achieved by assigning the value 3 to the subarray from index 1 to 6.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
