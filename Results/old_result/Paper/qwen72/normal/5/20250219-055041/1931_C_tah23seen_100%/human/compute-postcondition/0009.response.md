Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr). `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal. `n` is equal to the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 1. `j` is equal to `n - 1`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will either be the index of the first element in the list `arr` that is not equal to the next element, or it will be equal to `len(arr) - 1` if all elements in the list are the same. The length of the list `n` and the variable `j` remain unchanged, with `j` still being `n - 1`.
