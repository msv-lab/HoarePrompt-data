The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns an integer. It calculates the maximum of 0 and the difference between the largest index `j` of a non-repeating element from the end of the list and the first index `i` of a non-repeating element from the start of the list, minus 1. If all elements in `arr` are equal, it returns the maximum of 0 and the minimum of the length of the list minus the first index `i` minus 1, and the largest index `j` of a non-repeating element from the end, which is 0 in this case.
