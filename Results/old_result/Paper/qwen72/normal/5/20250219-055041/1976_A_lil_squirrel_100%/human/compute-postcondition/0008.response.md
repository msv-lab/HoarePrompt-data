The loop head involves the variables `ch` and `password`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `password`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `ch` must be the next character in the string `password`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20.
- `password` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
- `ch` is the first character of `password`.
- If `ch` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password` and `letters` is an empty list.
- If `ch` is a lowercase Latin letter, `letters` is a list containing the first character of `password` and `digits` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `ch` must be the second character of `password`.
- `password` remains the same, as it is the string being iterated over.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `ch` is the second character of `password`. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password` and `letters` is an empty list. If `ch` is a lowercase Latin letter, `letters` is a list containing the first character of `password` and `digits` is an empty list.**
