Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `ch` is the first character of `password` and is a digit, `letters` is an empty list, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password` (which is a digit).**

The code snippet `digits.append(ch)` adds the first character of `password` (which is a digit) to the `digits` list. The other variables remain unchanged.
