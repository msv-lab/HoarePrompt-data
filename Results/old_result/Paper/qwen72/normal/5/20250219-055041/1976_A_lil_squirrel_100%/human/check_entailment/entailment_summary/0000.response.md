Reasoning:
The provided Python program is designed to check if a given password meets the specified conditions for being strong. Let's break down the logic and verify if it correctly handles all the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself. This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Separation of Letters and Digits**: The program separates the characters of the password into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits. This is a good approach to handle the sorting conditions separately.

3. **Sorting Check for Letters and Digits**:
   - The program checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order using `if letters != sorted(letters)`.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order using `if digits != sorted(digits)`.
   - These checks are correct and ensure that the letters and digits are in the required order.

4. **Check for Digits Following Letters**:
   - The program iterates through the password and checks if any letter is immediately followed by a digit using `if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit()`.
   - This check ensures that there is no digit that comes after a letter, which is one of the conditions for a strong password.

5. **Output**:
   - If any of the conditions are not met, the program returns 'NO'.
   - If all conditions are met, the program returns 'YES'.

The program correctly implements all the required conditions and the logic is sound. The execution summary also confirms that the function behaves as expected.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
