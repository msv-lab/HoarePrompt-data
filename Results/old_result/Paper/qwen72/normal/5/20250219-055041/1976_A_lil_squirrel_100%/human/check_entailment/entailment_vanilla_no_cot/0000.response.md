Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the conditions specified for a strong password:

1. **Password Composition**: The program checks each character to determine if it is a digit or a letter and separates them into two lists (`digits` and `letters`).
2. **Sorting Check**: It verifies that both the `letters` and `digits` lists are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. **Order of Digits and Letters**: It ensures that no digit comes after a letter by iterating through the password and checking if a letter is followed by a digit.

The program will return "YES" if all conditions are met and "NO" otherwise. The logic and implementation are correct based on the problem description.
