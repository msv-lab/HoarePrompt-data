Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`. Additionally, `letters` is sorted, and `digits` is sorted, and `n` must be at least 2. If `password[i]` is a lowercase Latin letter and `password[i + 1]` is a digit, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.***
