Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`. Additionally, `letters` is sorted, and `digits` is sorted, and `n` must be at least 2. The loop has completed all iterations, and there is no position `i` in `password` such that `password[i]` is a lowercase Latin letter and `password[i + 1]` is a digit.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the initial conditions for `n`, `password`, `letters`, and `digits` remain unchanged. The loop has checked every possible pair of adjacent characters in `password` and found no instances where a lowercase letter is immediately followed by a digit. If such a pair was found at any point during the loop, the loop would have returned 'NO' and terminated early. Since the loop completed all iterations, it means that no such pair exists in the `password`.
