Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order and must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in `N`, `M` is an empty dictionary, and `cur` is -1. If `num` > `cur` + 1, then `cur` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
