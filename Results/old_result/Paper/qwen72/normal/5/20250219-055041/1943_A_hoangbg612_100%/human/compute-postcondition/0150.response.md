Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1`, `M` is a dictionary with at least two keys (one of which is `cur`), `cnt` is a list containing the key `cur` and the value `k` appended to it. If `M[cur]` is 1, `cnt` is a list containing the key `cur` and the value `k` appended to it.**

Explanation:
- The value of `N` remains unchanged.
- The value of `cur` remains unchanged.
- The dictionary `M` remains unchanged.
- The list `cnt` now contains the key `cur` and the value `k` appended to it. If `M[cur]` is 1, `cnt` was initially a list containing the key `cur`, and now it has the value `k` appended to it. If `M[cur]` is not 1, `cnt` was initially an empty list, and now it contains the value `k`.
