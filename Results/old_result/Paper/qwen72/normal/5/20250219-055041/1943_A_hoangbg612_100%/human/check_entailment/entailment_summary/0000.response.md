### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where they alternately pick elements from the array `a`.
   - Alice appends the picked element to array `c` and Bob simply removes the picked element from `a`.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` when the game ends, with Alice trying to maximize it and Bob trying to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy Analysis:**
   - **Alice's Strategy:** Alice will always try to pick the smallest missing integer that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - **Bob's Strategy:** Bob will try to pick the smallest integer that is already in `c` or the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` but is not the smallest missing integer to minimize the MEX.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The program sorts the array `N` and then iterates through it to find the largest integer `cur` such that all integers up to `cur` are unique and consecutive starting from 0.
   - If the sum of the counts of these unique integers equals `S` (the length of the array), it increments `cur` by 1.
   - If there are at least two unique integers in `a` that are consecutive and have a count of 1, `cur` is set to the second smallest of these integers before printing.

4. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
   - The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The program should consider the optimal moves of both players, not just the presence of unique and consecutive integers.
   - The use of the dictionary `M` to count occurrences is unnecessary and complicates the logic.
   - The final adjustment of `cur` based on the count of unique integers is incorrect and does not align with the game's rules.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves simulating the game with both players making optimal moves.
   - Alice will always pick the smallest missing integer that is not yet in `c`.
   - Bob will pick the smallest integer that is already in `c` or the smallest integer that is not the smallest missing integer to minimize the MEX.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program does not correctly simulate the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob, and the logic for determining the MEX is flawed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
