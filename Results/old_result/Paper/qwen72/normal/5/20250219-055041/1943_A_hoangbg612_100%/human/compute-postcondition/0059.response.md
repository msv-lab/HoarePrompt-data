Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `cur` is -1, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` that have a value of 1 (which is an empty list since `M` is empty), `_` is `_ + 1` and must be less than `T`.**
