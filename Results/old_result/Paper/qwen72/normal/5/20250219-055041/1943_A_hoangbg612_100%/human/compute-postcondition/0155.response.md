Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at the start of the loop, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1` and the values are the counts of these integers in `N`, and `cnt` is a list containing all the unique integers from `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1` and have a count of 1 in `M`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`N`**: The list `N` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`cur`**: The variable `cur` remains the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at the start of the loop. This means that `cur` does not change throughout the loop execution.
- **`M`**: The dictionary `M` contains the unique integers from `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1`, and the values are the counts of these integers in `N`. This dictionary is also not modified within the loop.
- **`cnt`**: The list `cnt` contains all the unique integers from `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1` and have a count of 1 in `M`. The loop appends each key `k` from `M` to `cnt` if the corresponding value `M[k]` is 1. After all iterations, `cnt` will include all such keys.
