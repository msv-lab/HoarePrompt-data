The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, and `num` is the third element in `N`. These conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `N`, `cur` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `N`, `cur` is increased by 1.**
