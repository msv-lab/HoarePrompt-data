Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `num` is the second element in `N`. If `num` > `cur`, `cur` is now equal to `num`, `M[num]` is 1, and if `num` > `cur + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num` ≤ `cur`, `M[cur]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `M[cur] += 1` is executed.
- This means that `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.
- The initial state specifies that if `num` ≤ `cur`, `M[cur]` is increased by 1. Therefore, `M[cur]` is now `M[cur] + 1`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
- The output state reflects that `M[cur]` has been incremented by 1, while the rest of the initial state remains valid.
