To determine what will be printed by the `print(cur)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `T` is an input integer where \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\) and must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
   - `S` is an input integer.
   - `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `cur` is the last element in `N` or the largest element in `N` that is not greater than `cur` + 1.
   - `M` is a dictionary with keys being the elements in `N` that are not greater than `cur` + 1, and each key's value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that key in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks or ends.
   - `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` that have a value of 1.
   - If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, `cur` is the second smallest element in `cnt`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `cur` is initially the last element in `N` or the largest element in `N` that is not greater than `cur` + 1.
   - `M` is a dictionary that counts consecutive occurrences of elements in `N` up to a certain point.
   - `cnt` is a list of keys from `M` that have a value of 1 (i.e., elements that appear exactly once in the consecutive sequence).
   - If `cnt` has at least 2 elements, `cur` is updated to the second smallest element in `cnt`.

3. **Determine the Value of `cur`:**
   - The value of `cur` depends on the contents of `N` and the resulting `cnt` list.
   - If `cnt` has fewer than 2 elements, `cur` remains the last element in `N` or the largest element in `N` that is not greater than `cur` + 1.
   - If `cnt` has at least 2 elements, `cur` is the second smallest element in `cnt`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(cur)` statement will print the value of `cur` as determined by the conditions above.

Since the exact contents of `N` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `cur`. However, based on the structure and conditions given, the print statement will output the value of `cur` as described.

Output: **cur (where cur is the second smallest element in the list `cnt` if `cnt` has at least 2 elements, otherwise cur is the last element in the list `N` or the largest element in `N` that is not greater than `cur` + 1)**
