The value of `M[cur]` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, and `num` is the third element in `N`. The code snippet does not affect `N` or `num`, so they remain unchanged. The specific value of `M[cur]` after the increment is not known, but it is increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `N`, `M[cur]` is increased by 1.**
