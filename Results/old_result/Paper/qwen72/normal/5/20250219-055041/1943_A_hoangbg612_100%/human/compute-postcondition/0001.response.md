The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `T`. For the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
