Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 2` at any point during the loop execution, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `N` that are not greater than `cur + 2` and the values are the counts of these integers in `N`. The sum of the values in `M` (i.e., the counts of the unique integers in `N` that are not greater than `cur + 2`) is equal to `S`.**

Explanation:
- `cur` is incremented by 1.
- The condition that `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` is now updated to `cur + 2`.
- The dictionary `M` now includes the counts of unique integers in `N` that are not greater than `cur + 2`.
- The sum of the values in `M` (i.e., the counts of the unique integers in `N` that are not greater than `cur + 2`) remains equal to `S`, as the counts of integers in `N` have not changed, only the threshold for inclusion in `M` has increased by 1.
