To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `N`. The loop will execute if `N` is not empty. Let's break down the state adjustments step by step:

1. **`N`**: The state before the loop starts indicates that `N` is a sorted list of integers. For the loop to execute, `N` must contain at least one integer.
2. **`num`**: This variable will be assigned the first element of `N` when the loop starts.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is a sorted list of integers.
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.
- `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n.
- `S` is an input integer.
- `M` is an empty dictionary.
- `_` is `_ + len(N) * len(M.keys())` and must be less than `T`.
- `cnt` is a list containing all keys `k` from `M` where `M[k]` is 1.
- `cur` is -1.

For the loop to execute, `N` must have at least one element. The variable `num` will be assigned the first element of `N` when the loop starts.

State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in `N`**
