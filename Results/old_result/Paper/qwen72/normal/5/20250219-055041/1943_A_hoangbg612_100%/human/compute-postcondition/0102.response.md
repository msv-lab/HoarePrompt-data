Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution, `M` is a dictionary with keys from `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that integer appeared in `N` and was not greater than `cur + 1` at the time of its appearance, `_` is `_ + len(N) * len(M.keys())` and must be less than `T`, `cnt` is a list containing all keys `k` from `M` where `M[k]` is 1.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer within the range 1 to 20,000.
- The variable `T` remains unchanged and is still an input integer within the range 1 to 20,000, and it must be greater than 0.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged and is still an integer within the range 1 to 200,000.
- The list `a` remains unchanged and still contains `n` integers where each integer is within the range 0 to `n-1`.
- The variable `S` remains unchanged and is still an input integer.
- The list `N` remains unchanged and is still a sorted list of integers read from the input.
- The variable `cur` remains unchanged and is still the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution.
- The dictionary `M` remains unchanged and still contains keys from `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution, with values representing the count of how many times each integer appeared in `N` and was not greater than `cur + 1` at the time of its appearance.
- The variable `_` is incremented by `len(N) * len(M.keys())` and must still be less than `T`.
- The list `cnt` is now populated with all keys `k` from the dictionary `M` where the value `M[k]` is 1. This means that `cnt` contains all the unique integers from `N` that appeared exactly once and were not greater than `cur + 1` at the time of their appearance.
