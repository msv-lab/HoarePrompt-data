Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` only handles two specific cases: when the length of the array `a` is 2, it prints a fixed output "4 1" followed by "1 2", and for all other lengths, it prints "13 0". This approach is flawed because it does not consider the actual values in the array `a` or the MEX operation, which is crucial for maximizing the sum of the array elements.

The program should:
1. Calculate the MEX of the entire array or subarrays.
2. Apply the operation to maximize the sum of the array elements.
3. Output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations that achieve this sum.

However, the current implementation does not perform any of these steps. It simply prints a fixed output based on the length of the array, which is incorrect for most inputs.

Correctness: **False**
