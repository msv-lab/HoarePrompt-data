The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a formatted string with two fixed values: '13' and '0'. 

- The value '13' is a constant string.
- The value '0' is also a constant string.

The initial state describes the list `c` and the variable `m`, but these values are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be exactly as specified in the `print` statement, regardless of the values of `c` and `m`.

Output: **13 0**
