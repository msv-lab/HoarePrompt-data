Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def solve(n, k):`, where `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    n, k = map(int, s.split())
    if k >= 2:
        if n == k:
            print(*[k for j in range(k)])
        else:
            print('-1')
    else:
        print(*[(j + 1) for j in range(n)])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`[*open(0)][1:]` is a list containing at least one element, `s` is the first element of this list, `n` is the integer value of the first part of `s` split by spaces, and `k` is the integer value of the second part of `s` split by spaces. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` remains equal to `k` if they were originally equal, or `n` remains not equal to `k` if they were originally not equal. If `k` is less than 2, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`[*open(0)][1:]` is a list containing at least two elements, `s` is the second element of this list, `n` is the integer value of the first part of `s` split by spaces, and `k` is the integer value of the second part of `s` split by spaces. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` and `k` are updated to the integer values of the first and second parts of `s` split by spaces, respectively. If `k` is less than 2, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `[*open(0)][1:]` is a list containing at least three elements, `s` is the third element of this list, `n` and `k` are the integer values of the first and second parts of `s` split by spaces, respectively. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, no changes are made. If `k` is less than 2, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
