The function reads lines from the standard input, excluding the first line. For each subsequent line, it splits the line into two integers `n` and `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is equal to `k`, it prints `k` repeated `k` times. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is not equal to `k`, it prints `-1`. If `k` is less than 2, it prints the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. After processing all lines, the function concludes with no return value.
