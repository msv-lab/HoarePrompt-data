Postcondition: **`[*open(0)][1:]` is a list containing at least one element, `s` is the first element of this list, `n` is the integer value of the first part of `s` split by spaces, `k` is the integer value of the second part of `s` split by spaces, and `k` is greater than or equal to 2. If `n` is equal to `k`, the current value of `n` remains equal to the current value of `k`. If `n` is not equal to `k`, the current value of `n` is not equal to the current value of `k`.**
