Postcondition: ***`[*open(0)][1:]` is a list containing at least two elements, `s` is the second element of this list, `n` is the integer value of the first part of `s` split by spaces, and `k` is the integer value of the second part of `s` split by spaces. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` and `k` are now the integer values of the first and second parts of `s` split by spaces, respectively. If `k` is less than 2, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. If `n` equals `k`, the values of `n` and `k` are as described above. If `n` does not equal `k`, the values of `n` and `k` are also as described above.***
