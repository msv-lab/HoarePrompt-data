Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. `[*open(0)][1:]` is a list containing at least two elements. This means that the file descriptor `0` (which typically refers to standard input) is read, and the contents are split into a list, with the first element removed.
2. `s` is the second element of this list. Since the list has at least two elements, `s` is guaranteed to exist.
3. `n` is the integer value of the first part of `s` split by spaces.
4. `k` is the integer value of the second part of `s` split by spaces.
5. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` and `k` are now the integer values of the first and second parts of `s` split by spaces, respectively. If `k` is less than 2, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Given the code snippet:
```
print('-1')
```

The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'-1'`. The values of `n` and `k` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **-1**
