You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def solve(n, k):`, where `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[(j + 1) for j in range(n)])
        
    #State: `[*open(0)][1:]` is an empty list, and the loop has processed all the lines from the input. For each line processed, `n` and `k` were updated to the integer values of the first and second parts of the line split by spaces, respectively. If `k` was greater than or equal to 2 and `n` was equal to `k`, the loop printed `k` repeated `k` times. If `k` was greater than or equal to 2 and `n` was not equal to `k`, the loop printed `-1`. If `k` was less than 2, the loop printed the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3 and returns a value based on these parameters.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
