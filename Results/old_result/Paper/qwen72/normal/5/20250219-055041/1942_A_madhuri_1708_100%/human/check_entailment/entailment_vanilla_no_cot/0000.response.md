Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Handling `k == 1`**:
   - The program prints a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` when `k == 1`. This is correct because the only sorted cyclic shift in this case is the original array itself, and the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]` is sorted.

2. **Handling `k >= 2`**:
   - The program checks if `n == k` and prints an array of `k` elements all set to `k` if true. This is incorrect because the array `[k, k, ..., k]` (with `n` elements) will have all cyclic shifts sorted, not just `k` of them.
   - If `n != k`, the program prints `-1`. This is also incorrect because there can be valid arrays for `k >= 2` and `n != k`.

3. **Handling `k == n`**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k == n` by printing an array of `n` elements all set to `k`. However, this is only one specific solution, and there are other valid solutions as well (e.g., any array with all elements equal).

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the following cases:

- **If `k == 1`**:
  - Any strictly increasing sequence will work. For example, `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

- **If `k == n`**:
  - Any array with all elements equal will work. For example, `[1, 1, ..., 1]`.

- **If `1 < k < n`**:
  - We need to construct an array such that exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted. One way to do this is to create an array where the first `k` elements are in increasing order, and the remaining elements are all equal to the last element of the first `k` elements. For example, `[1, 2, ..., k, k, k, ..., k]`.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k == 1:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])
        elif k == n:
            print(*[1 for j in range(n)])
        elif 1 < k < n:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(k)] + [k for j in range(n - k)])
        else:
            print('-1')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

- **If `k == 1`**:
  - Print the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

- **If `k == n`**:
  - Print an array of `n` elements all set to `1`.

- **If `1 < k < n`**:
  - Print the sequence `[1, 2, ..., k, k, k, ..., k]` where the first `k` elements are in increasing order and the remaining `n - k` elements are all equal to `k`.

- **If `k > n` or `k < 1`**:
  - Print `-1` because the problem guarantees `1 \leq k \leq n`.

This corrected program should handle all cases correctly as per the problem description.
