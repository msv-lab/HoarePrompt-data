Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate a valid array for cases where \( k \) is greater than 1 but not equal to \( n \). 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4 2
```
According to the problem description, we need to find an array of length 4 that has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts. However, the program will output:
```
-1
```
This is incorrect because there exists a valid array that meets the requirements. One such valid array is:
```
1 2 3 1
```
The cyclic shifts of this array are:
- [1, 2, 3, 1] (sorted)
- [2, 3, 1, 1] (not sorted)
- [3, 1, 1, 2] (not sorted)
- [1, 1, 2, 3] (sorted)

Thus, the array [1, 2, 3, 1] has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts, which satisfies the problem requirements. The program fails to generate such a valid array and incorrectly outputs -1. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
