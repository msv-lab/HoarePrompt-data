You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

- Annotated Code:

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function func_1. The function is expected to read input from stdin, which should contain integers separated by spaces.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains the integers from the input provided, where each integer is converted from a string to an int. The input is expected to be a sequence of integers separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a sequence of integers separated by spaces from the standard input. It converts each string in the sequence to an integer and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not modify any external variables or state.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are relevant to the problem description.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns an empty list, as `func_1()` is not defined and thus does not provide any values to be converted into a list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an empty list. This is because `func_1` is not defined, and thus the call to `list(func_1())` results in an empty list being returned.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, and pos is an integer that will be the index of k in arr if k is found.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: `n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid

        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :

        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: (low + 1, pos + 1) (where `low + 1` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than `k`, and `pos + 1` is 0 if `k` is not found in `arr`, or the index of the first occurrence of `k` plus one if `k` is found)
    #State: *`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` or is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop, and `mid` is the last midpoint calculated before the loop terminates. If `arr[low] == k`, then `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k` and `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It internally calls `func_1` to obtain `n` and `k`, and `func_2` to obtain a list `arr` of integers representing a permutation of size `n`. The function then searches for the integer `k` in the list `arr`. If `k` is found, `pos` is set to the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. If `k` is not found, `pos` remains -1. The function also performs a binary search to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k` and the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k`. If `k` is found at `arr[low]`, the function prints 0. If `k` is not found, the function prints 1 and then prints the values `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, where `low + 1` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than `k`, and `pos + 1` is 0 if `k` is not found in `arr` or the index of the first occurrence of `k` plus one if `k` is found.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not handle the case where more than one swap is required to position the target element `x` such that the binary search algorithm can find it correctly. According to the problem description, the program should be able to perform up to 2 swaps to ensure that the binary search algorithm can find the target element `x` in the permutation. However, the program only performs a single swap if the target element is not found in the correct position after the binary search.

**Example Case:**

Consider the input:
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```

The target element `x` is 3, and it is located at index 1 (0-based index). The binary search will start with `low = 0` and `high = 6`. The first midpoint `mid` will be 3, and since `arr[3] = 5` is greater than 3, `high` will be updated to 3. The next midpoint `mid` will be 1, and since `arr[1] = 3` is equal to 3, `low` will be updated to 1. However, `arr[low]` is already 3, so the program will output:
```
0
```

This is incorrect because the binary search algorithm will not find the target element `x` in the correct position without at least one swap. In this case, the correct output should be:
```
1
1 2
```

However, the program does not handle cases where more than one swap is needed. For example, consider the input:
```
1
6 3
5 4 1 6 2 3
```

Here, the target element `x` is 3, and it is located at index 5 (0-based index). The binary search will start with `low = 0` and `high = 6`. The first midpoint `mid` will be 3, and since `arr[3] = 6` is greater than 3, `high` will be updated to 3. The next midpoint `mid` will be 1, and since `arr[1] = 4` is greater than 3, `high` will be updated to 1. The final midpoint `mid` will be 0, and since `arr[0] = 5` is greater than 3, `high` will be updated to 0. The loop will terminate, and `arr[low]` will be 5, not 3.

In this case, the program will output:
```
1
0 5
```

However, this single swap is not sufficient to ensure that the binary search algorithm can find the target element `x` correctly. The correct output should be:
```
2
0 5
1 4
```

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases where more than one swap is required.
