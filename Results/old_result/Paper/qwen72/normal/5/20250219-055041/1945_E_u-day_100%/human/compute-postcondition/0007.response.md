The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.

The state of `pos` and the list `arr` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the element at the first position of the list `arr` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is 0. Otherwise, `pos` retains its initial value (which is not specified in the precondition).**
