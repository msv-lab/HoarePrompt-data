Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function reads two integers from the input, `n` and `k`, which represent the length of the permutation and the number to be found, respectively. It returns a map object of these integers. This function is correctly implemented and serves its purpose.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function reads a sequence of integers from the input and returns them as a list. This function is also correctly implemented and serves its purpose of reading the permutation.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function is the core of the solution. It performs the following steps:
   - Reads `n` and `k` using `func_1`.
   - Reads the permutation `arr` using `func_2`.
   - Searches for the position of `k` in the permutation and stores it in `pos`.
   - Initializes `low` and `high` for the binary search.
   - Performs a binary search to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k` and the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k`.
   - If `k` is found at `arr[low]`, it prints 0, indicating no swaps are needed.
   - If `k` is not found at `arr[low]`, it prints 1 and then the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to indicate a swap.

However, there are a few issues with `func_3`:
- **Binary Search Initialization**: The binary search initialization should be `low = 0` and `high = n` instead of `low = 0` and `high = n + 1`. The current initialization can lead to an out-of-bounds error when accessing `arr[mid]` if `mid` is equal to `n`.
- **Binary Search Loop Condition**: The loop condition `while low + 1 < high` is correct for the binary search, but the initialization of `high` should be `n` to avoid out-of-bounds errors.
- **Output for Swap**: The function prints `low + 1` and `pos + 1` for the swap. This is correct in terms of the indices being 1-based, but it should ensure that `pos` is not -1 (i.e., `k` is actually found in the permutation).

Given these points, the function `func_3` is almost correct but has a potential out-of-bounds error due to the incorrect initialization of `high`. Additionally, the function should handle the case where `k` is not found in the permutation more robustly.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the issues, the function `func_3` should be modified as follows:

```python
def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
            break
    if pos == -1:
        print(0)  # k is not found in the permutation
        return
    (low, high) = (0, n)
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        st.add(mid)
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
```

With these changes, the function will correctly handle the binary search and ensure that the indices are within bounds.
