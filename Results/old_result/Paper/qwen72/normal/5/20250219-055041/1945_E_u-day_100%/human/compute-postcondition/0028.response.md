Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` or is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, `low` is `(low + high) // 2`, `high` is `n`, `st` is a set containing the values `n // 2` and `mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `n` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- `low` is updated to the value of `mid`, which is `(low + high) // 2`.
- The value of `high` remains `n`.
- The set `st` still contains the values `n // 2` and `mid`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
