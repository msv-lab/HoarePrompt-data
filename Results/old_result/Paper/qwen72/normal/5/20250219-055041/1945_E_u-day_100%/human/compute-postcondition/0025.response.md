Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` or is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, `low` is 0 and `high` is `n // 2` if `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, otherwise `low` is `n // 2` and `high` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `st` is a set containing the value `n // 2`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`.
- The previous values of `low` and `high` are used to calculate the new `mid`.
- The other variables (`n`, `i`, `pos`, `st`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `low` and `high` based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `k` remain valid.
- The set `st` still contains the value `n // 2`.
- The value of `n` remains greater than or equal to its initial value and must be greater than 1.
