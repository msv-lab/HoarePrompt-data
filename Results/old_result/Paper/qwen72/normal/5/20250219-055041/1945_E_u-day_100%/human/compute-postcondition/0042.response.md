Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` or is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop, and `mid` is the last midpoint calculated before the loop terminates. If `arr[low] == k`, then `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k` and `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.***
