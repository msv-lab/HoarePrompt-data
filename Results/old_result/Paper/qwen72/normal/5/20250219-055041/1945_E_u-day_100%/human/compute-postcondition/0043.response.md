The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `pos`. `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, and `pos` is an integer that will be the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found. The function returns the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present; otherwise, it returns a specific value indicating that `k` is not found in `arr`.
