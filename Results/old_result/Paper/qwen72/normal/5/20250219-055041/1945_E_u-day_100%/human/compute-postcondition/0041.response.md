To determine what will be printed by the `print(low + 1, pos + 1)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`n`**: This variable is greater than or equal to its initial value. This suggests that `n` might have been modified during the execution of some loop or function, but it is at least as large as it was initially.

2. **`i`**: This variable is set to `n - 1`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is the index of the last element in the list `arr` (assuming `arr` has `n` elements).

3. **`pos`**: This variable remains `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`, or it is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found. 

4. **`low`**: This variable is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`.

5. **`high`**: This variable is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`.

6. **`st`**: This is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop.

7. **`mid`**: This is the last midpoint calculated before the loop terminates.

8. **`arr[low]` is not equal to `k`**: This is an important condition that affects the value of `low`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the `print` statement:

- **`low + 1`**: Since `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `low + 1` will be the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than `k`. This is because `arr[low]` is the largest element that is less than or equal to `k`, and the next element (at index `low + 1`) must be greater than `k`.

- **`pos + 1`**: If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` is `-1`, so `pos + 1` will be `0`. If `k` is found, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k`, so `pos + 1` will be the index of the first occurrence of `k` plus one.

Now, let's consider the possible scenarios:

1. **If `k` is not found in `arr`**:
   - `pos` is `-1`, so `pos + 1` is `0`.
   - `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, and `low + 1` will be the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than `k`.

2. **If `k` is found in `arr`**:
   - `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k`, so `pos + 1` will be `pos + 1`.
   - `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, and `low + 1` will be the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than `k`.

In both scenarios, `low + 1` will be the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than `k`. 

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **(low + 1, pos + 1) (where `low + 1` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than `k`, and `pos + 1` is 0 if `k` is not found in `arr`, or the index of the first occurrence of `k` plus one if `k` is found)**
