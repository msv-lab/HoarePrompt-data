Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` or is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, `low` is 0 and `high` is `n // 2` if `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, otherwise `low` is `n // 2` and `high` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `st` is a set containing the value `n // 2`, and `mid` is `n // 2`.***
