Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` as returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is -1.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `pos` to -1. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `pos` and retains the initial values of `n`, `k`, and `arr`.
