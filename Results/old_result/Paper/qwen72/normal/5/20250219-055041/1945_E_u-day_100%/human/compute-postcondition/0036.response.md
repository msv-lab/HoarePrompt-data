Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` or is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop, and `mid` is the last midpoint calculated before the loop terminates.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: The value of `i` remains `n-1` because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`pos`**: The value of `pos` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify `pos`. It will still be -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, or the index of the first occurrence of `k` if `k` is found.
- **`low`**: After the loop terminates, `low` will be the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`. This is because the loop continues to adjust `low` and `high` until `low + 1 >= high`, and at that point, `low` will be the last index where `arr[low]` is less than or equal to `k`.
- **`high`**: After the loop terminates, `high` will be the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`. This is because the loop continues to adjust `low` and `high` until `low + 1 >= high`, and at that point, `high` will be the first index where `arr[high]` is greater than `k`.
- **`st`**: The set `st` will contain all the midpoints calculated during the loop. Each midpoint is added to `st` in each iteration, and the loop will continue to add midpoints until it terminates.
- **`mid`**: The value of `mid` will be the last midpoint calculated before the loop terminates. This is the midpoint that was calculated when `low + 1 < high` was no longer true.
