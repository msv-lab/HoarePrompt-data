The given `print` statement is:

```python
print(1)
```

This statement simply prints the integer `1`. The initial state provides detailed information about several variables and objects (`n`, `i`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, `st`, `mid`, and `arr`), but none of these are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the initial state.

Output: **1**
