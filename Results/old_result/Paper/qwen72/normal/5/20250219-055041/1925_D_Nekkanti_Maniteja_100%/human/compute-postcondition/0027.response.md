Output State: **`i` is `k` (initial value), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than the initial `k`, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, `s` is `s + c * (k-1) * c * m + c * a * k`, `a` is the sum of `f` values from `m` inputs, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is updated to be the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `s`, `a`, `u`, `v`, `f`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
- The new value of `c` is calculated using the `pow` function, which computes the modular multiplicative inverse.
- The initial state of `c` being the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007` is confirmed and updated.
