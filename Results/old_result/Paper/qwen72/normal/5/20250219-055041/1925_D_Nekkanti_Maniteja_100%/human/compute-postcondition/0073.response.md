The function `func` accepts three parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `m` tuples, each containing three integers `(a_i, b_i, f_i)`. The parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers with the following constraints: 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 × 10^5. Each tuple `(a_i, b_i, f_i)` has the constraints 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. The function processes these inputs and returns a specific value based on the given constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `m` tuples `(a_i, b_i, f_i)`. It returns a value based on the constraints and relationships between these parameters and the list of tuples.**
