Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 2, `k` is unspecified, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `2 * f`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.**

The code snippet `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are now the input integers. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
