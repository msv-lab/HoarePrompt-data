Output State: **`M` is 1000000007, `i` is `m-1`, `k` is an input integer greater than the initial `k` and greater than or equal to 3, `m` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, `s` is 0, `u` is the last input integer from the `m`-th iteration, `v` is the second last input integer from the `m`-th iteration, `f` is the third last input integer from the `m`-th iteration, `a` is the sum of all `f` values from the `m` iterations.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `m` iterations:
- The value of `M` remains 1000000007.
- The value of `i` is `m-1`, indicating that the loop has completed `m` iterations.
- The value of `k` is still an input integer greater than the initial `k` and greater than or equal to 3.
- The value of `m` is the input integer that determines the number of iterations.
- The value of `n` is the input integer used to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse.
- The value of `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`.
- The value of `s` remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are the last input integers from the `m`-th iteration.
- The value of `a` is the sum of all `f` values from the `m` iterations.
