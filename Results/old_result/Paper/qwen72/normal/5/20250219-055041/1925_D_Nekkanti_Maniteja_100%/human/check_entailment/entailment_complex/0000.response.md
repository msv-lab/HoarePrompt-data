### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It also reads `m` lines of input, each containing `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`.

2. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The function calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `10^9 + 7` using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`. This is correct because the modular multiplicative inverse is used to divide by `n * (n - 1) // 2` in modular arithmetic.

3. **Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - The function correctly sums up the initial friendship values `f_i` into the variable `a`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each of the `k` excursions.
   - However, the way it calculates the expected value is incorrect. The expected value for each excursion should be the sum of the initial friendship values plus the number of excursions times the probability of picking a friend pair.
   - The current implementation uses a loop to add `c * i * c * m + c * a` to `s` for each `i` from 0 to `k-1`. This is not the correct way to calculate the expected value.

5. **Correct Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The correct expected value for each excursion is `a * c + m * c * i`.
   - The sum of these expected values over `k` excursions should be `a * c * k + m * c * (k * (k - 1) // 2)`.
   - The function should simplify this to avoid the loop and directly compute the sum.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The final value of `s` should be printed modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Correct Implementation:
```python
def func():
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        # Correct expected value calculation
        s = (a * c * k + m * c * (k * (k - 1) // 2)) % M
        
        print(s)

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the way it calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
- The correct implementation avoids the loop and directly computes the sum using the formula derived from the expected value calculation.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.
