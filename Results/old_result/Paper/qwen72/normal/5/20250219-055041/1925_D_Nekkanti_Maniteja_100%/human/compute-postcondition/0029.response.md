Output State: **`i` is `k` (initial value), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than the initial `k`, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, `s` is 0, `a` is 0, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.**

The variable `a` is reset to 0, and all other variables retain their initial values.
