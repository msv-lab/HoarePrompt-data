Postcondition: **`a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= m <= n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m, `b_freq` is a dictionary-like object that counts the frequency of each integer in the list `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of the first m integers in the list `a`, `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of each integer in the first m integers of `a` and the corresponding frequencies in `b`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than `m`. If `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, `good_subarrays` is 1. Otherwise, `good_subarrays` remains 0. Additionally, the current value of `a[i]` is an integer that is present in the `b_freq` dictionary.**
