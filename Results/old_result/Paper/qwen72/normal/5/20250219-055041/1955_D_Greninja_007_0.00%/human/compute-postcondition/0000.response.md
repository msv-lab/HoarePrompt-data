Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= m <= n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m, `good_subarrays` is 0.**

The variable `good_subarrays` is initialized to 0, and the initial conditions for `a`, `b`, and `k` remain unchanged.
