The code snippet `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` updates the value of `arr[i - 1]` to be the first element of the list `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged. Here's the detailed output state:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`, and if `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.**
