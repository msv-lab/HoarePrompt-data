Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `m - 1`, `ans` is False, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and the current value of `nums` is not sorted.**

The code snippet sets `ans` to False, while the other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this update.
