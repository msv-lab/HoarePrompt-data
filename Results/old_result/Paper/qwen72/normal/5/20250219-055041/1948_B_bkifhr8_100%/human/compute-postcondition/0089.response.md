The function `func` is designed to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer array `a` of length `n` where `2 ≤ n ≤ 50` and the elements of `a` are in the range `0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99`. The function determines if it's possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits. The input is provided in a specific format: the first line contains the number of test cases `t` (where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3`), followed by `t` test cases, each with two lines: the first line contains `n`, and the second line contains the `n` integers of the array `a`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer array `a` of length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) with elements in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99. It returns `True` if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their constituent digits, and `False` otherwise.**
