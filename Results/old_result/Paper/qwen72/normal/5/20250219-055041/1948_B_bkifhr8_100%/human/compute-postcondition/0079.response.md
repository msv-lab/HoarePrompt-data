The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop is iterating in reverse from `m - 1` down to `1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m - 2`, and `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decreased by 1 to `m - 3`, and `m` must still be greater than or equal to 2. However, for the loop condition to be met, `i` must be greater than 0.

Given that `i` is `m - 2` at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be `m - 3` and `m` must be greater than 3 to ensure `i` is still greater than 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 3, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `m - 3`, and `ans` is True. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `ans` is set to False if `nums` is not sorted, otherwise `ans` remains True. `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`, and the value of `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`.**
