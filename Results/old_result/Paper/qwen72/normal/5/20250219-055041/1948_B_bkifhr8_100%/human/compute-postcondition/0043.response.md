To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1).
- `_` is a placeholder.
- `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `i` is 1.
- If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the first element of `arr` followed by the second element of `arr`, `arr[0]` is now `nums[0]`, and `ans` remains True if `nums` is sorted; otherwise, `ans` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, the variables retain their initial values.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` in the range from `m - 1` to `1` (inclusive), decrementing by 1.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, and the loop condition must still be satisfied.

### Loop Condition:
- The loop condition is `i` in the range from `m - 1` to `1` (inclusive).
- Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` will be 0.
- However, the loop will not execute if `i` is 0 because the range is from `m - 1` to `1` (inclusive).

### Adjustments:
- The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`.
- `i` is decremented by 1, so it will be 0.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must be in the range from `m - 1` to `1` (inclusive). Since `i` is 0, the loop will not execute again.

### Final State:
- `i` is 0.
- The loop will not execute again because `i` is out of the range.

State: **`n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0, `nums` and `ans` retain their values from the previous iteration.**
