Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 3, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`, and `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `ans` remains True if `nums` is sorted; otherwise, `ans` is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` remains True.***
