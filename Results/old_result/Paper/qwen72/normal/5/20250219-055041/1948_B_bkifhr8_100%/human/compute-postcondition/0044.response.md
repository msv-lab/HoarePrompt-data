Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`, `ans` retains its value from the previous iteration.**

Explanation:
- The value of `nums` is updated to a list that contains the digits of the integer at `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer at `arr[i]`.
- Since `i` is 0, `i - 1` is -1, which refers to the last element of `arr`.
- The digits of the integer `arr[-1]` are converted to a list of integers and concatenated with the integer `arr[0]`.
- The values of `n`, `_`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
