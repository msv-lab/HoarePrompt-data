The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `m`, and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates in reverse from `m - 1` down to `1` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` is greater than 1, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, and `i` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `m - 2`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` as integers followed by `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` remains True.**
