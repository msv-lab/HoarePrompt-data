Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` as separate integers followed by `arr[i]`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]` and `ans` remains True. Otherwise, `ans` remains True and no changes are made to `arr[i - 1]`.***
