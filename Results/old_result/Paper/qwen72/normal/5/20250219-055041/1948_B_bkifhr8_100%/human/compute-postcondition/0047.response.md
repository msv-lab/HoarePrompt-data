Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` retains its value from the previous iteration.***
