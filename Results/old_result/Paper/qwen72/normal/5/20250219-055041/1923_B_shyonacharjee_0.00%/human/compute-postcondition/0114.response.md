Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n` and the firing rate `k` (bullets per second), followed by the healths of the monsters and their initial positions. It then determines if it is possible to defeat all the monsters by firing bullets at them, considering the time it takes for the bullets to reach each monster based on their positions. The function prints 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated within the available time, and 'NO' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function concludes. **
