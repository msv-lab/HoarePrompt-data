Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `position` and `health` are assigned the values from the second element of the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the new `position`, `time_available` is equal to the new `distance`, `bullets_needed` is equal to the new `health`, `total_bullets_used` is increased by the new `bullets_needed`. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, `success` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
