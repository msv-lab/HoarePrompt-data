The function `func_1` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the number of monsters.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, representing the number of bullets you can fire per second.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the health of each monster.
- `x` is a list of `n` integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0, representing the initial positions of the monsters.

The function returns the result of processing each test case, which involves calculating the time required to defeat all the monsters based on their health and initial positions, and the rate at which bullets can be fired.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`. For each test case, it calculates and returns the time required to defeat all the monsters, given their health and initial positions, and the rate at which bullets can be fired.**
