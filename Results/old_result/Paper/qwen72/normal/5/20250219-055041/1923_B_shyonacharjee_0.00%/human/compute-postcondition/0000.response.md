Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the number of monsters; k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, representing the number of bullets you can fire per second; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the health of each monster; x is a list of n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0, representing the initial positions of the monsters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
