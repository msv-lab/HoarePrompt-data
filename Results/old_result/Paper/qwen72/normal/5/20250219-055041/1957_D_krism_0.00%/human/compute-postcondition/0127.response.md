Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 31, `ans` is `2 * pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + 2 * pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is equal to `arr[1]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[1]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[2]`, `j` is 31. For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, `pre[j][0]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `i` remains 2.
- The variable `n` remains 31.
- The variable `ans` remains `2 * pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + 2 * pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`.
- The variable `y` remains equal to `arr[1]`.
- The variable `k` remains the bit length of `arr[1]` minus 1.
- The variable `c` remains `prefix[2]`.
- The variable `j` has completed its range from 0 to 31 and is now 31.
- For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, `pre[j][1]` has been incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` has been decremented by 1. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, `pre[j][0]` has been incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` has been decremented by 1.
