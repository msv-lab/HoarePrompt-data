The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the `range(32)` function, so we can only adjust `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the range defined by `range(32)`. If `j` is less than 32, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. At the start of the next iteration, `j` is incremented by 1 to 1.

State: **`i` is 31, `n` is greater than 0, `cur` is equal to `prefix[31]`, `j` is 1**
