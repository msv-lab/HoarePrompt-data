Output State: **`i` is 30, `n` is greater than 0, `cur` is equal to `prefix[30]`, `j` is 2, `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1.** 

The value of `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1, while the other variables (`i`, `n`, `cur`, and `j`) remain unchanged. The condition that `cur >> j & 1` is true is assumed to be valid based on the initial state.
