Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 31, `ans` is `2 * pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + 2 * pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is equal to `arr[1]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[1]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[2]`, `j` is 1, `pre[j][0]` is increased by 1.** 

In natural language, the value of `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1, while the values of `i`, `n`, `ans`, `y`, `k`, `c`, and `j` remain unchanged.
