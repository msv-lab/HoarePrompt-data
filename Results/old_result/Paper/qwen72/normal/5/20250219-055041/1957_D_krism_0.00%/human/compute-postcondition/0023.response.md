The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the constant `32`. The loop will execute regardless of the values of `i`, `n`, and `cur` because the range function will always generate a sequence from 0 to 31, which means the loop will run 32 times. However, since the task is to adjust the states for the loop to execute, and the loop will execute as long as the range function is called with 32, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the objects in the loop head.

However, if we are to strictly adhere to the format and the task of adjusting the states, we should consider the initial state of `j` and the condition that ensures the loop can start. The variable `j` is not defined before the loop, but it will be initialized by the `range` function to 0 at the start of the loop. The loop will execute 32 times, so the range is valid and does not need any adjustment.

State: **`i` is 31, `n` must be greater than 0, `cur` is equal to `prefix[31]`, `j` is 0**
