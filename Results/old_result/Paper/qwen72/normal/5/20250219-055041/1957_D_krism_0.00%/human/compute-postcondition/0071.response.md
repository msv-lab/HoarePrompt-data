Output State: **`i` is 29, `n` is greater than 0, `cur` is equal to `prefix[29]`, `j` is 32. For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 1, `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all 32 iterations, the variable `i` remains 29, `n` is still greater than 0, and `cur` is still equal to `prefix[29]`. The variable `j` is now 32, indicating that the loop has finished executing. For each bit position from 0 to 31, the loop has checked the corresponding bit in `cur` and incremented the appropriate counter in the `suf` array: `suf[j][1]` if the bit was 1, and `suf[j][0]` if the bit was 0.
