Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 31, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is equal to `arr[1]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[1]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 31**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to be the bit length of `y` minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
