The only variables in the loop head are `j`, so we can only adjust `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to the range 32. If `j` is less than 32, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. At the start of the next iteration, `j` is increased by 1, so `j` is 1.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 31, `ans` is `3 * pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + 3 * pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is equal to `arr[2]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[2]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[3]`, `j` is 1. If the least significant bit of `c` is 1, `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if the least significant bit of `c` is 0, `pre[j][0]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1.**
