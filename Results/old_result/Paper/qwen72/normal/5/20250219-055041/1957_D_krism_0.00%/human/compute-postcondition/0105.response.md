Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 31, `ans` is `2 * pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + 2 * pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is equal to `arr[1]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[1]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 31**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` to its current value.
- The current value of `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`.
- After the addition, `ans` becomes `2 * pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + 2 * pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `y`, `k`, `c`, and `j` remain unchanged.
