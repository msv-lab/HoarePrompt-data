Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is 31, for each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, if the bit at position `j` in `prefix[i]` is 1, `suf[j][1]` is incremented by the number of times that bit is 1 across all `prefix` values from `prefix[31]` to `prefix[1]`. Otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by the number of times that bit is 0 across all `prefix` values from `prefix[31]` to `prefix[1]`. `ans` is 0.**
