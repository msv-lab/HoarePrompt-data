The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the user, followed by a list of `n` integers. It computes the cumulative XOR of the elements in the list and stores these values in a list `prefix`. It then initializes two lists, `pre` and `suf`, each containing 32 sublists with two elements (0 and 0). The function increments the first element of each sublist in `pre` by 1. For each element in `prefix` (excluding the first element), the function updates the `suf` list based on the bit positions of the current element. It calculates a final result `ans` by summing up specific products derived from the `pre` and `suf` lists, and prints this result. The function does not return any value.
