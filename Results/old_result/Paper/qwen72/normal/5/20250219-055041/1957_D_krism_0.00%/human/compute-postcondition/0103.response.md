Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 31, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is equal to `arr[1]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[0]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 31**

Explanation: The code snippet `y = arr[i - 1]` updates the value of `y` to be equal to `arr[1]` because `i` is 2, and `i - 1` is 1. The values of `i`, `n`, `ans`, `k`, `c`, and `j` remain unchanged.
