Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is 0, `n` is 31, and for each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, if the bit at position `j` in `prefix[i]` is 1, `suf[j][1]` is incremented by the number of times that bit is 1 across all `prefix` values from `prefix[31]` to `prefix[1]`. Otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by the number of times that bit is 0 across all `prefix` values from `prefix[31]` to `prefix[1]`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the variable `i` has been decremented to 0, and the variable `n` has been used as the starting point for the loop, which was 31. The `suf` array has been updated such that for each bit position from 0 to 31, the count of 1s and 0s in that bit position across all `prefix` values from `prefix[31]` to `prefix[1]` is stored in `suf[j][1]` and `suf[j][0]`, respectively.
