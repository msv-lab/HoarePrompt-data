The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part into an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `arr`.

Initial State: The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the array and the number of test cases. A revised function definition would look like: `def count_tuples(t, arrays):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `arrays` is a list of lists, each containing integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that `1 <= n <= 10^5` and `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`. `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is an input integer, the function definition is still incomplete and does not match the problem description.**
