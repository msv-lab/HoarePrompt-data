Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 31, `ans` is `3 * pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + 3 * pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is equal to `arr[2]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[2]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[3]`, `j` is 2, `pre[j][0]` is increased by 1, `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1.**

The value of `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1, while the values of all other variables remain unchanged. The initial state is still valid, with the only change being that `suf[j][0]` is now one less than its original value.
