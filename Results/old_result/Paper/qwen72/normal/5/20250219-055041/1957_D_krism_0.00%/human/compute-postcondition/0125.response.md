Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 31, `ans` is `2 * pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + 2 * pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is equal to `arr[1]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[1]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[2]`, `j` is 2, `pre[j][0]` is increased by 1, `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `suf[j][0] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `suf[j][0]` after the decrement is not provided, but it is now one less than its previous value.
- The initial state information that is still valid is included in the output state.
