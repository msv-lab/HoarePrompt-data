Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 1, `k` is the current value of `2 * k - ul`, `res` is a list containing all elements from `a` that appear exactly once in the first `n` elements of `a`, `i` is the index of the last element of `a` that was processed (or `n` if the loop completed without breaking), `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` which are each incremented by 1, `re` is the number of elements added to `res` (which is `k` if the loop broke early or the number of unique elements in the first `n` elements of `a` if the loop completed), `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`, and `ur` is 0. Additionally, the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a` (`ul`) is not equal to 0 (`ur`).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of integers, `n` must be at least 1, `k` is the current value of `2 * k - ul`, `res` is a list containing all elements from `a` that appear exactly once in the first `n` elements of `a`, `i` is the index of the last element of `a` that was processed (or `n` if the loop completed without breaking), `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` which are each incremented by 1, `re` is the number of elements added to `res` (which is `k` if the loop broke early or the number of unique elements in the first `n` elements of `a` if the loop completed), `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`, and `ur` is 0. If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of integers, `n` must be at least 1, `k` is the current value of `2 * k - ul`, `res` is a list containing all elements from `a` that appear exactly once in the first `n` elements of `a`, `i` is `i + 1`, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` which are each incremented by 1, `re` is the number of elements added to `res`, `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`, `ur` is 2 if `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, otherwise `ur` remains 0. If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of integers, `n` must be at least 1, `k` is the current value of `2 * k - ul`, `res` is a list containing all elements from `a` that appear exactly once in the first `n` elements of `a`, `i` is `n + 1`, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` which are each incremented by 1, `re` is the number of elements added to `res`, `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`, `ur` is 2 if `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, otherwise `ur` remains 0. If `ul` equals `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
