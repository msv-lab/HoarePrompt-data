Output State: **`a` is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `a` is now a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` for `i` in the range 0 to `n-1` is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[n] - 1` is incremented by 1, the element at index `a[n + 1] - 1` is incremented by 1, and the element at index `a[n + 2] - 1` is incremented by 1, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are all 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n + 2`.**
