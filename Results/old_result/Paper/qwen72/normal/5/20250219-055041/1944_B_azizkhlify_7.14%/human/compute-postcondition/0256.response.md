Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.
- `n` is a new input integer that must be greater than 1.
- `k` is now `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1.
- `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[j] - 1]` for `j` in `n` to `2 * n - 1` which are incremented by 1.
- `re` is 1 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `re` remains 0.
- `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 2.
- `ur` is 0.
- `res` is a list containing the first element of `a` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `res` remains an empty list.
- If `re` is equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a` and `n`**:
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 1.

2. **List `l`**:
   - `l` is a list of length `n`.
   - Each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1.
   - This means `l` counts the occurrences of each element in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`).

3. **List `r`**:
   - `r` is a list of length `n`.
   - Each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `n` to `2 * n - 1`) is incremented by 1.
   - This means `r` counts the occurrences of each element in `a` (from index `n` to `2 * n - 1`).

4. **Variable `re`**:
   - `re` is 1 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `re` remains 0.
   - Since `i` is 1, `re` will be 1 if the second element of `a` (i.e., `a[1]`) appears exactly once in the first `n` elements of `a`.

5. **Variable `ul`**:
   - `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 2.
   - This means `ul` counts how many elements in the first `n` elements of `a` appear exactly twice.

6. **Variable `k`**:
   - `k` is now `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not 0.
   - This means `k` is adjusted based on the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1) that appear exactly twice.

7. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is 1.

8. **List `res`**:
   - `res` is a list containing the first element of `a` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `res` remains an empty list.
   - Since `i` is 1, `res` will contain the first element of `a` if the second element of `a` (i.e., `a[1]`) appears exactly once in the first `n` elements of `a`.

### Determining the Output:
- The `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the element at index `i` of the list `a`.
- Since `i` is 1, the element at index 1 of `a` will be printed.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list `a`)**
