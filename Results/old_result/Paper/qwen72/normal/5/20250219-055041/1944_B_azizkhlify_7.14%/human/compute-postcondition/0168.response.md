Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 1, `k` is the current value of `2 * k - ul`, `res` is a list containing the first `k` elements of `a` that appear exactly once in the first `n` elements of `a`, `i` is the index of the last element of `a` that was processed (or `n` if the loop completed without breaking), `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` which are each incremented by 1, `re` is the number of elements added to `res` (which is `k` if the loop broke early or the number of unique elements in the first `n` elements of `a` if the loop completed), `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`, `ur` is 0, and `k` is non-zero.**

### Explanation:
- **`a`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`k`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`res`**: Contains the first `k` elements of `a` that appear exactly once in the first `n` elements of `a`. If there are fewer than `k` such elements, `res` will contain all of them.
- **`i`**: The index of the last element of `a` that was processed. If the loop completes without breaking, `i` will be `n`.
- **`l`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`r`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`re`**: The number of elements added to `res`. If the loop broke early because `re` reached `k`, then `re` is `k`. If the loop completed without breaking, `re` is the number of unique elements in the first `n` elements of `a`.
- **`ul`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`ur`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
