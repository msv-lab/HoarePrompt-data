To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `res` is a non-empty list containing elements from `a` that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 1.
   - The elements in `res` are added up to the point where `re` reached `k` (if `k` is not 0).
   - `i` is the third element in `res`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `res` is a list that contains elements from `a` based on a specific condition.
   - `i` is the third element in this list `res`.

3. **Execution of the Print Statement:**
   - The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space.

Given that `i` is the third element in `res`, we need to determine what this third element is. However, the exact values of `a` and `l` are not provided, so we can't compute the exact numerical value of `i`. But we can describe it based on the given information.

**Output:**
The code will print the third element of the list `res`, followed by a space.
Output: **i (where i is the third element of the list res)**
