Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (though `n` is not used in the code snippet).
   - The element at the index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is using the variable `i` which is 0.
   - Therefore, `a[i]` is `a[0]`.
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `a[0]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

4. **Determine the Value of `a[0]`:**
   - The precondition states that the element at the index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is 2.
   - This implies that `a[0] - 1` is a valid index in the list `l`.
   - Let's denote `a[0]` as `x`. Then, `l[x - 1]` is 2.
   - Since `x - 1` is a valid index, `x` must be at least 1 (because indices start at 0).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The value of `a[0]` is `x`.
   - The `print` statement will output `x` twice, followed by a space.

Since the exact value of `a[0]` is not provided, we can only describe it based on the given information.

Output: **x x (where x is the value of a[0] and l[x - 1] is 2)**
