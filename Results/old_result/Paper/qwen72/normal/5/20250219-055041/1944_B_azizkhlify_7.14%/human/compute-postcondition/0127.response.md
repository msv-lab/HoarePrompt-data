Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 1, `k` is assigned the value from the input, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` which are each incremented by 1, `re` is 0. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ul` is 2 and `ur` is 0. Otherwise, `ul` and `ur` retain their initial values of 0. The current value of `ul` is `k * 2`.**
