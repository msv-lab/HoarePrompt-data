Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `res` is a list with elements that satisfied the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` up to the point where `re` equals `k` or the loop has iterated through all elements of `a`. `i` is the last element of `res` if `res` is not empty. Additionally, `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`res` is a list with elements that satisfied the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` up to the point where `re` equals `k` or the loop has iterated through all elements of `a`. `i` is the last element of `res` if `res` is not empty. `ul` is not equal to `ur` unless `ul == ur` was true before the if statement. `i` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `ur` is increased by 2, otherwise `ur` remains unchanged. If `ul == ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`res` is a list with elements that satisfied the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` up to the point where `re` equals `k` or the loop has iterated through all elements of `a`. `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` must be greater than 0. `ul` is not equal to `ur` unless `ul == ur` was true before the if statement. If `ul == ur`, the loop or if statement that the `break` statement was inside has been exited. If `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, then `ur` is `ur + 2`. Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`res` is a list with elements that satisfied the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` up to the point where `re` equals `k` or the loop has iterated through all elements of `a`. `i` is `n + 2`, and `n` must be greater than 0. `ul` is not equal to `ur` unless `ul == ur` was true before the if statement. If `ul == ur`, the loop or if statement that the `break` statement was inside has been exited, and `ur` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, then `ur` is `ur + 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
