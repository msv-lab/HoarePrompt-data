Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `res` is a list with elements that satisfied the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` up to the point where `re` equals `k` or the loop has iterated through all elements of `a`.
2. `i` is the last element of `res` if `res` is not empty.
3. `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
4. `i` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0.
5. The current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

### Analysis:
- From the initial state, we know that `i` is the last element of `res` if `res` is not empty, but it is also explicitly stated that `i` is `n` and `n` is greater than 0.
- This implies that `i` is a valid index in the list `a`.
- The current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, which is not directly relevant to the `print` statement but provides context about the state of the program.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
- Since `i` is `n` and `n` is greater than 0, `a[i]` is a valid element in the list `a`.

### Output:
- The value of `a[i]` will be printed twice, followed by a space.

Output: **a[n] a[n] ** (where `a[n]` is the element at index `n` in the list `a` and `n` is greater than 0)
