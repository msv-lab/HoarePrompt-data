Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.
- `n` is a new input integer that must be greater than 0.
- `k` is defined as `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1.
- `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[j] - 1]` for `j` in `n` to `2 * n - 1` which are incremented by 1.
- `re` is 0.
- `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 2.
- `ur` is 0.
- `res` is an empty list.
- The element at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is explicitly set to 0.

2. **Variable `a`**:
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the input. The exact values of `a` are not specified, but we know that `a` is a list of integers.

3. **Variable `l`**:
   - `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1.
   - This means that for each element `a[j]` in the first `n` elements of `a`, the corresponding index in `l` (i.e., `a[j] - 1`) is incremented by 1.

4. **Condition on `l`**:
   - The element at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is 1.
   - Since `i` is 0, this means `l[a[0] - 1]` is 1.

5. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement `print(a[i], end=' ')` will print the element at index `i` of the list `a`.
   - Since `i` is 0, the print statement will print the first element of the list `a`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the first element of the list `a`.

Output: **a[0] (where a[0] is the first element of the list `a`)**
