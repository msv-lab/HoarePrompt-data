Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `res` is a list with at least 2 elements.
- `i` is the second element of `res`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `res`**: The list `res` is guaranteed to have at least 2 elements. Let's denote the elements of `res` as `res[0]`, `res[1]`, `res[2]`, etc.
2. **Variable `i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is the second element of `res`. Therefore, `i` is `res[1]`.
3. **Print Statement**: The `print` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space (because `end=' '` is specified).

### Output:
The code will print the second element of the list `res` followed by a space.

Output: **[res[1]] (where res[1] is the second element of the list res)**
