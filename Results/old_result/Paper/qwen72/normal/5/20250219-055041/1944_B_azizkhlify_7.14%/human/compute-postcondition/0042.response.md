Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ul` is either `k * 2` or less than `k * 2` depending on the number of times the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` was met, `k` is `2 * k - ul`, and the elements of `l` and `r` remain unchanged except for the increments based on the initial values of `a`.**
