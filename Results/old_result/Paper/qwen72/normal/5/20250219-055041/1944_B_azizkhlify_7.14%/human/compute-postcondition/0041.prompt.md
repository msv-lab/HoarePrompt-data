Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `a` is now a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` for `i` in the range 0 to `n-1` is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[i] - 1` for `i` in the range `n` to `2n-1` is incremented by 1, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are all 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `2n-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ul` remains unchanged. If the element at the index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is 2, `ul` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `ul` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ul` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, `ul` is increased by 2. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is not equal to 2, `ul` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of `ul` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `ul` is increased by 2. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is not 2, `ul` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
