Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1.** 

In natural language: The value of `idx` is decreased by 1, making it the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
