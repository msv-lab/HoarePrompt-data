The variables in the loop head are `k` and `idx`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `k >= 1 << idx`. At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than or equal to \(1 << 3\) (which is 8).

Since `k` and `idx` are the only variables in the loop head, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 8 for the loop to proceed. The current value of `idx` is 3, and it will be incremented in the loop body, but for the next iteration, it must still satisfy the condition with the current value of `idx`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, `idx` is 3, `k` must be greater than or equal to 8**
