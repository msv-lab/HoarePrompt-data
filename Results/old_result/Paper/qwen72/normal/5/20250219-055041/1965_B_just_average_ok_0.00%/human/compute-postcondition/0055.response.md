The function `func` does not explicitly list the parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, representing some values that are used in the function.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so it is unclear what the function returns. However, based on the typical structure of such functions, it is likely that the function returns some result for each test case, possibly related to the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers with 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.**
