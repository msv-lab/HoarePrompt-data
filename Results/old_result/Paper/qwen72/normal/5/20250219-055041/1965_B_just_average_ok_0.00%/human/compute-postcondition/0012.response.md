Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, and the last element of `nums` is `k - nums[idx]`, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`.
- The value of `nums[idx]` is the smallest power of 2 in the list `nums` that is greater than or equal to `k`.
- Therefore, the last element of `nums` is now `k - nums[idx]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
