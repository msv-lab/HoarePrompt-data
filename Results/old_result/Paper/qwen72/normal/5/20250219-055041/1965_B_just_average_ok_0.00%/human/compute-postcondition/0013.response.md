The code snippet `nums.append(k + 1)` appends the value `k + 1` to the list `nums`. The initial state specifies that `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, and the last element of `nums` is `k - nums[idx]`, where `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1. After appending `k + 1` to `nums`, the list will have one additional element, and the last element will now be `k + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, and the last element of `nums` is `k + 1`, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1.**
