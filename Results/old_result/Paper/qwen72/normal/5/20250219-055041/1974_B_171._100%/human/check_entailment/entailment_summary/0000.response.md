Reasoning:  
The provided program follows the decoding algorithm correctly as per the problem description. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t`, the length of each encoded string `n`, and the encoded strings `b`.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - **Unique Characters**: It constructs a set of unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorts them to create the auxiliary string `r`.
   - **Character Mapping**: It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).
   - **Decoding**: It iterates over the encoded string `b` and replaces each character with its corresponding character from the `char_map` to form the decoded string.

3. **Output**: The program prints the decoded strings for each test case.

The program correctly handles the input and output format, and the decoding logic matches the problem description. The execution summary confirms that the function `func_1` performs the required character replacement using the sorted unique characters.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
