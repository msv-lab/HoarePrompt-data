Reasoning:

The program is designed to decode a string that has been encoded using the specified algorithm. Let's break down the steps and verify if they correctly implement the decoding process:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, reading the length `n` and the encoded string `b` for each test case.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string `b` using `sorted(set(encoded))`.
   - It then creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted list is mapped to its corresponding character in the reversed list.
   - Finally, it constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the `char_map` dictionary.

3. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results of the decoding for each test case and prints them.

### Verification of the Algorithm:
- **Step 1**: Construct the new auxiliary string `r` consisting of all distinct letters of the string `s` in alphabetical order.
  - This is correctly implemented by `unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))`.

- **Step 2**: Replace each character in the string `s` by its symmetric character from the string `r`.
  - This is correctly implemented by the dictionary `char_map` where `char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`.

- **Step 3**: Construct the decoded string by applying the character mapping.
  - This is correctly implemented by `decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Character String**: The program correctly handles single character strings.
  - For example, if `encoded = "w"`, the `unique_chars` list will be `["w"]`, and the `char_map` will map `w` to `w`, resulting in the correct output `"w"`.

- **Strings with Repeated Characters**: The program correctly handles strings with repeated characters.
  - For example, if `encoded = "ttf"`, the `unique_chars` list will be `["f", "t"]`, and the `char_map` will map `t` to `f` and `f` to `t`, resulting in the correct output `"fft"`.

- **Strings with All Unique Characters**: The program correctly handles strings where all characters are unique.
  - For example, if `encoded = "serofedsoc"`, the `unique_chars` list will be `["c", "d", "e", "f", "o", "r", "s"]`, and the `char_map` will map `c` to `s`, `d` to `r`, `e` to `o`, `f` to `e`, `o` to `d`, `r` to `f`, and `s` to `c`, resulting in the correct output `"codeforces"`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
