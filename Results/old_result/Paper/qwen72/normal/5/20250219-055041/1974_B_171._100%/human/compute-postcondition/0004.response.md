Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`, `char_map` is a dictionary with the first character of `unique_chars` mapped to the last character of `unique_chars`, `len_unique` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code assigns the last character of `unique_chars` to the first character of `unique_chars` in the `char_map` dictionary. Since `i` is 0, `unique_chars[i]` refers to the first character, and `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]` refers to the last character. The states of `encoded`, `unique_chars`, `len_unique`, and `i` remain unchanged.
