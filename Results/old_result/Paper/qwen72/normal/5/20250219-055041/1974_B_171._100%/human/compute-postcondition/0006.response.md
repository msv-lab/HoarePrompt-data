Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`, `char_map` is a dictionary with the first character of `unique_chars` mapped to the last character of `unique_chars` and the second character of `unique_chars` mapped to the second last character of `unique_chars`, `len_unique` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the `char_map` dictionary by mapping the second character of `unique_chars` (i.e., `unique_chars[1]`) to the second last character of `unique_chars` (i.e., `unique_chars[len_unique - 2]`).
- The values of `encoded`, `unique_chars`, `len_unique`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The dictionary `char_map` now includes an additional mapping, making it a dictionary with the first character of `unique_chars` mapped to the last character of `unique_chars` and the second character of `unique_chars` mapped to the second last character of `unique_chars`.
