### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list called `data`.
   - It initializes an index to keep track of the current position in the `data` list.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the first element of `data` and increments the index.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`, and increments the index accordingly.
   - This part of the program is correct and handles the input as expected.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string `b` using `sorted(set(encoded))`.
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `char_map` to store the character mappings.
   - It iterates over the unique characters and maps each character to its symmetric character in the sorted list.
   - It constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from the `char_map`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program appends the decoded string for each test case to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each decoded string in the `results` list.
   - This part of the program is also correct and handles the output as expected.

4. **Correctness of Decoding Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them.
   - It correctly maps each character to its symmetric character in the sorted list.
   - The decoding process is performed by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the `char_map`.
   - The logic for mapping and replacing characters is sound and follows the problem description accurately.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles single-character strings correctly.
   - It also handles strings with repeated characters correctly, as the `char_map` only contains unique characters and their symmetric mappings.
   - The program is robust and should work for all valid inputs as specified in the problem description.

### Annotated Code Validation:
- **Initial State:**
  - `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
  - This is correct and matches the problem description.

- **Inside `func_1`:**
  - `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`.
  - `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its corresponding character in the reversed `unique_chars` list.
  - `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`.
  - `i` is `len_unique - 1` after the loop.
  - These states are correctly described and match the program's behavior.

- **Final State:**
  - The program returns the string `decoded`, where each character in the original string `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding character in the reversed `unique_chars` list according to the `char_map`.
  - This is correct and matches the expected decoding process.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the correct decoded strings. The original assessment was accurate.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
