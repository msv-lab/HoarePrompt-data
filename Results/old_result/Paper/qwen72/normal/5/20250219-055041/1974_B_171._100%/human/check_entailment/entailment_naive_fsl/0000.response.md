Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly follows the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. It constructs the auxiliary string `r` from the unique, sorted characters of the encoded string `b`, and then creates a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart. The decoding process involves replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from the mapping. The program handles multiple test cases and processes the input and output as specified. No edge cases or missing logic have been identified that would cause the program to fail for any valid input.
