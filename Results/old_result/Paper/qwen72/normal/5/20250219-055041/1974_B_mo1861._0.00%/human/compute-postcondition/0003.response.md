Output State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one unique character, `char_map` is a dictionary with one entry where the key is the first unique character in the sorted set of `b` and the value is a character calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 0 - 1))`, `i` is 0, `c` is the first unique character in the sorted set of `b`**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `b` is a string with lowercase Latin letters and at least one unique character.
- `char_map` is initially an empty dictionary.
- `i` is 0.
- `c` is the first unique character in the sorted set of `b`.

The code snippet:
- `char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))` adds an entry to `char_map` where the key is `c` and the value is a character calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 0 - 1))`.
- Since `i` is 0, the value is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 1))`.
- The length of `b` is used to determine the position of the character in the alphabet, starting from 'a'.

Therefore, the output state is as described above.
