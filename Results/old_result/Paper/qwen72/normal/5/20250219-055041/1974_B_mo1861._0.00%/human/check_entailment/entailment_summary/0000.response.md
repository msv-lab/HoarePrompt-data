Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to decode the string `b` by creating a mapping from each unique character in `b` to a new character. However, the mapping logic is incorrect. The program should map each character in `b` to its symmetric character in the sorted set of unique characters, not to a character based on the length of the entire string `b`. The correct mapping should be from the first character in the sorted set to the last, the second to the second last, and so on.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issues:
1. **Character Mapping**: The program uses `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))` to map characters, which is incorrect. This formula maps characters based on the length of the entire string `b`, not the length of the unique characters in `b`.
2. **Correct Mapping**: The correct mapping should be from the first character in the sorted set to the last, the second to the second last, and so on. This can be achieved by creating a list of unique characters in sorted order and then mapping the first character to the last, the second to the second last, and so on.

Given these issues, the program will not produce the correct decoded string for the given examples.

Correctness: **False**
