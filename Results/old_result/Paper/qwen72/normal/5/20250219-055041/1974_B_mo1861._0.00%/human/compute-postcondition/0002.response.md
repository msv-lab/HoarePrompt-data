The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `c`, and the expressions `enumerate(sorted(set(b)))`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of `b` and the initialization of the loop variables `i` and `c`.

1. **Variable `b`**: The loop will execute if `b` contains at least one unique character. Since `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, it must contain at least one character for the loop to execute.
2. **Variable `i`**: This is the index variable, which will be initialized to 0 by the `enumerate` function.
3. **Variable `c`**: This will be the first unique character in the sorted set of `b`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `b` has at least one unique character, `i` is initialized to 0, and `c` is the first unique character in the sorted set of `b`.

State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one unique character, `char_map` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 0, `c` is the first unique character in the sorted set of `b`**
