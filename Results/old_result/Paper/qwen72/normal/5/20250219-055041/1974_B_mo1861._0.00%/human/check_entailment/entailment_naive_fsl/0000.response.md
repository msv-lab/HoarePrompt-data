Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the encoding and decoding process as described in the problem. Specifically, the `char_map` is created using the length of the set of characters in `b` (i.e., the number of distinct characters), but the program incorrectly uses the length of `b` to map the characters. This will lead to incorrect decoding when the length of the set of characters is less than the length of `b`.

For example, consider the input `b = "abacaba"`. The distinct characters in `b` are `a`, `b`, and `c`, so the string `r` should be `"abc"`. The correct decoding should map `a` to `c`, `b` to `b`, and `c` to `a`, resulting in the string `"cbcbcbc"`. However, the program will incorrectly map `a` to `g`, `b` to `f`, and `c` to `e`, resulting in the string `"gffgffg"`, which is not the correct decoding.

To fix this, the `char_map` should be created using the length of the set of characters, not the length of the string `b`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    distinct_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {}
    for i, c in enumerate(distinct_chars):
        char_map[c] = distinct_chars[len(distinct_chars) - i - 1]
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```
