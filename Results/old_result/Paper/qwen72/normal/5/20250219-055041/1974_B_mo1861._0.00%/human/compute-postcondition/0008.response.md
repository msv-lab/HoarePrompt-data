Output State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one unique character, `char_map` is a dictionary with entries for each unique character in the sorted set of `b`, where the keys are the unique characters and the values are characters calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))` for each unique character, with `i` ranging from 0 to the number of unique characters minus 1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the `char_map` dictionary will contain a mapping for each unique character in the string `b`. The keys in `char_map` will be the unique characters from `b` in sorted order, and the values will be characters calculated by starting from 'a' and moving forward in the alphabet based on the position of the character in the sorted set of unique characters from `b`. The first unique character will map to the last character in the alphabet (based on the length of `b`), the second unique character will map to the second last character, and so on, until the last unique character maps to the first character in the alphabet. The variable `i` will be the number of unique characters minus 1, and `c` will be the last unique character in the sorted set of `b`.
