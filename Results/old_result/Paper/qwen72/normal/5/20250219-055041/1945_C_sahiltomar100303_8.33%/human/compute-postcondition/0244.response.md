Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `s` is a new input string.
   - `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `leftMove` is 0.
   - `left` is 0.
   - `right` is `n`.
   - `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]`.
   - `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]`.
   - `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[:mid]`.
   - `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[:mid]`.
   - `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(right)`.

3. **Determine the Value of `right`:**
   - According to the initial state, `right` is equal to `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `right` is equal to `n`, the print statement will output the value of `n`.

Output: **n (where n is the input integer greater than 0)**
