`trightZero` is incremented by 1. Since `trightZero` was initially either 2 or 3, after the increment, `trightZero` will be either 3 or 4. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `mid + 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `n`, `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftZero` is the same as `leftZero` if `s[i]` is '0' for any `i` in the range `[0, mid)`, otherwise `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s` and `tleftOne` is the same as `leftOne`, `rightZero` is 1 or 2, `trightZero` is 3 or 4, `rightOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0 or 1.**
