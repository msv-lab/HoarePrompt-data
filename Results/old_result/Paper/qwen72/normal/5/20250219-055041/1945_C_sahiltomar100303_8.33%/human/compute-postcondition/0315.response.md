Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0 if `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is greater than 0, `right` is the new `n` if `right == n`, otherwise `right` is not equal to the new `n`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `i` is `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
- The variables `trightZero` and `rightZero` both count the number of '0's in the second half of the string `s` (from index `mid` to `n-1`).
- The variables `trightOne` and `rightOne` both count the number of '1's in the second half of the string `s` (from index `mid` to `n-1`).
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `leftMove`, `left`, `right`, `tleftZero`, and `tleftOne`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
