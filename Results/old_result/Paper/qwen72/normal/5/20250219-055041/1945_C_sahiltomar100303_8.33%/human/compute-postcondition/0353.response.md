Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 2`, `leftZero` is 1 if the character at index `right` in `s` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `leftOne` is 0 if the character at index `right` in `s` is '0' and 1 otherwise, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in `s` minus 1 if the character at index `right` in `s` is '0' and the number of '0's in `s` otherwise, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in `s` minus 1 if the character at index `right` in `s` is not '0' and the number of '1's in `s` otherwise, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - n // 2 + 1) // 2`, `tleftZero` is `leftZero + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1.
- The previous value of `leftZero` is used to update `tleftZero`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
