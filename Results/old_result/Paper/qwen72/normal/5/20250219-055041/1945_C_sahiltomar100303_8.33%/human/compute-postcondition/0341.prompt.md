Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is `mid`, `right` is the new `n` if `right == n`, otherwise `right` is not equal to the new `n`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is `mid - 1`, `right` is the new `n` if `right == n`, otherwise `right` is not equal to the new `n`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid - 1` characters of `s` and must be less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid - 1` characters of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s` and must be less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2. If the character at position `left` in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is decreased by 1 and `rightZero` is increased by 1. If the character at position `left` in `s` is not '0', then `tleftOne` is decreased by 1 and `rightOne` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is `left - 1`, `right` is the new `n` if `right == n`, otherwise `right` is not equal to the new `n`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid - 1` characters of `s` and must be less than `(left + 1) // 2 - 1` if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid - 1` characters of `s` and is now `leftOne - 1` if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is not '0', otherwise it remains unchanged, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s` and is now `rightZero + 1` if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged, `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s` and must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2, `rightOne` is now `rightOne + 1` if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is not '0', otherwise it remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is `left - 1` and must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid - 1` characters of `s` and must be less than `(left + 1) // 2` if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2 - 1`. If the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is now `leftZero - 1`, `rightZero` is now `rightZero + 1`, and `rightOne` remains unchanged. If the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is not '0', then `leftOne` is now `leftOne - 1`, `rightOne` is now `rightOne + 1`, and `rightZero` remains unchanged. In both cases, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
