Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `left` is greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is not equal to `n`, `leftZero` remains unchanged, `leftOne` remains unchanged, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is equal to the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `tleftOne` is equal to the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, and the absolute difference between `((n + 1) // 2 - left)` and `((n + 1) // 2 - right)` is such that `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)`.**
