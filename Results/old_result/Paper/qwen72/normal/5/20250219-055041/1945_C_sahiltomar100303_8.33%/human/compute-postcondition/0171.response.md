Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `mid`, `leftMove` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 1, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 1, `left` is 0, `right` is `n`, `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s` and `tleftZero` is the same as `leftZero` if `s[i]` is '0' for any `i` in the range `[0, mid)`, otherwise `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s` and `tleftOne` is the same as `leftOne`, `mid` must be less than `n`, and `s[i]` is not '0'.**
