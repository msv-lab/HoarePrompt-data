Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `mid + 1`, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `n` must be greater than `mid + 1`. If `s[i]` is '0', `rightZero` and `trightZero` are increased by 1. If `s[i]` is '1', `rightOne` and `trightOne` are increased by 1.***
