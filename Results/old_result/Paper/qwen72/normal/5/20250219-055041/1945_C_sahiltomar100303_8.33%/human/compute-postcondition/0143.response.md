Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0. If `left` is 0, `right` is `n`, and if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, then `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. If `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, then `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `left` is greater than 0, then `tleftZero` is 0. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the absolute difference between `((n + 1) // 2 - left)` and `((n + 1) // 2 - right)` is such that `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)` or `abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) > abs((n + 1) // 2 - right)`.**
