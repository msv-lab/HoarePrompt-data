Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 4, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is `n // 2 - 2` and greater than 0, `right` is `n`, `leftZero` is `n // 2 - 3` and greater than or equal to 0, `rightZero` is incremented by 1 if the character at the position `left - 1` in the string `s` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` remains unchanged, `leftOne` remains unchanged, `rightOne` remains unchanged, and `rightOne` must still be less than `(n - (n // 2 - 1) + 1) // 2` if `leftZero` is not less than `((n // 2 - 1) + 1) // 2`.**
