Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is `mid`, `right` is `n`, `rightOne` is increased by 1, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` if `leftZero` is not less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, and the character at the position `left - 1` in the string `s` is not '0', `leftOne` is decremented by 1.**
