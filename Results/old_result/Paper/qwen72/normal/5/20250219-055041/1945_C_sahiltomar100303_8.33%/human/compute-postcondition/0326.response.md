Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is `mid - 1`, `right` is the new `n` if `right == n`, otherwise `right` is not equal to the new `n`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid - 1` characters of `s` and must be less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid - 1` characters of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s` and must be less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2. If the character at position `left` in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is decreased by 1 and `rightZero` is increased by 1. If the character at position `left` in `s` is not '0', then `tleftOne` is decreased by 1 and `rightOne` is increased by 1.**
