Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is `mid`, `right` is `n`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftZero` is the same as `leftZero` if `s[i]` is '0' for any `i` in the range `[0, mid)`, otherwise `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s` and `tleftOne` is the same as `leftOne`.**

The code snippet `leftMove = 0` does not change any of the initial conditions, but it explicitly sets `leftMove` to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
