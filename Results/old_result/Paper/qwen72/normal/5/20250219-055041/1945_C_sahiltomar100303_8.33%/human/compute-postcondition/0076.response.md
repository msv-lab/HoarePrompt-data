Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 4, `s` is an input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `left` is equal to `mid - 2` and greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` minus 3, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s` plus 3, `tleftZero` and `trightZero` are updated accordingly, and if `s[left - 1]` is not '0', `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s` minus 2, `rightOne` is increased by 2, and `trightOne` is updated accordingly.**
