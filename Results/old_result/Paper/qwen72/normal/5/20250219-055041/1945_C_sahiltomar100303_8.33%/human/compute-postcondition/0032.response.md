Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is incremented by 1, `rightZero` remains 0, `leftOne` remains unchanged, `rightOne` remains 0, `tleftZero` is incremented by 1, `trightZero` remains 0, `tleftOne` remains unchanged, and `trightOne` remains 0. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightZero` remains 0, `tleftZero` is 1 or 2, `trightZero` remains 0, `tleftOne` is 2, 3, or 4, `trightOne` remains 0, and `leftOne` is 1, 2, or 3.***
