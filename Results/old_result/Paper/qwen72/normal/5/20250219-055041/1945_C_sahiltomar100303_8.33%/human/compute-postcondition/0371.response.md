Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `n`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, and the loop condition `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` is no longer true. Additionally, `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.**
