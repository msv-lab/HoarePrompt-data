The code snippet `c.append(y)` appends the value of `y` to the list `c`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50 and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99
- `k` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers that must have at least `i + 1` elements
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `x` is the last digit of the integer at index `i` in the list `a`
- `y` is the integer part of the division of the integer at index `i` in the list `a` by 10

The value of `y` is appended to the list `c`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `k`, `a`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50 and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least `i + 1` elements, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is the last digit of the integer at index `i` in the list `a`, `y` is the integer part of the division of the integer at index `i` in the list `a` by 10, `c` is a list that now includes the value of `y` at its end.**
