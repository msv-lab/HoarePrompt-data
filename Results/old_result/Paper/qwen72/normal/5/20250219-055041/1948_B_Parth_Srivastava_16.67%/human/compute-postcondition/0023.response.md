Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements, where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the last digit of `a[0]`, `y` is 0, `n` is 0, `c` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `a[i]` is greater than 10.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to the last digit of the integer at index `i` (which is 0) in the list `a`. Since `a[i]` is greater than 10, `x` will be a value between 0 and 9, inclusive. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
