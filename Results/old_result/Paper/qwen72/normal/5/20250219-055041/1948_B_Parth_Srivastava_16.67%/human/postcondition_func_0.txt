The function `func_1` processes a list of integers `a` derived from user input. It constructs a new list `c` by modifying elements of `a` that are greater than 10 according to specific rules. If an element in `a` is greater than 10, it is split into its last digit and the integer part of the element divided by 10. These parts are then added to `c` based on their relative values. The function then checks if the list `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `c` is sorted, it appends `1` to a list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`. The function does not return any value but modifies the list `b` to include the result of the sorting check for the processed list `a`.
