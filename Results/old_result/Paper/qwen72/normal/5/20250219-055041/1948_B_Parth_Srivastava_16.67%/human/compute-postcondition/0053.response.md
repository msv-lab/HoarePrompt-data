The code `c.append(a[i])` appends the element `a[i]` to the list `c`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50 and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99
- `k` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element
- `i` is 1 or greater than 1
- `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`
- `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10
- `n` and `c` are updated based on the new values of `x` and `y` as described in the conditions

The impact of the code:
- The list `c` is updated by appending the value `a[i]` to it.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50 and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 1 or greater than 1, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, `n` and `c` are updated based on the new values of `x` and `y` as described in the conditions, `c` now includes `a[i]` as its last element.**
