Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the case where an element is greater than 10 and needs to be split, but the resulting digits might need to be inserted in a different position to maintain the sorted order. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
12 3 45 67
```
The program will split `12` into `1` and `2`, and `45` into `4` and `5`, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the split operation needs to be applied multiple times to different elements, and the resulting digits need to be inserted in a way that maintains the sorted order.

Another example where the program fails is:
```
1
3
12 28 5
```
The program will split `12` into `1` and `2`, and `28` into `2` and `8`, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`. This array is not sorted, and the program will incorrectly output `NO` because it does not consider the possibility of further splits or reordering to achieve a sorted array.

These examples demonstrate that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, leading to incorrect results.
