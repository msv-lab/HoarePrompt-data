Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements, where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10, `i` is greater than 0, the current value of `a[i]` is greater than 10, and the current value of `y` is greater than or equal to the value of the last element in `c` (which is `c[n - 1]`). If `y` <= `x`, `n` is 2 and `c` is a list with two elements `[y, x]`. Otherwise, `n` is 1 and `c` is a list with one element, `c[0]` is `a[i]`.***
