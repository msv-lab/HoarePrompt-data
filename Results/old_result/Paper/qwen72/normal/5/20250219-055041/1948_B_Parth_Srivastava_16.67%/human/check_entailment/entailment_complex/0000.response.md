### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length `k` of the array and the array `a` itself.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: The function `func_1` is called for each test case. Inside `func_1`, the array `a` is processed to check if it can be transformed into a non-decreasing order by splitting elements greater than 10.

3. **Splitting Elements**: The function correctly splits elements greater than 10 into their digits and appends them to the list `c` in the correct order. This is done using the conditions:
   - If the element is greater than 10 and it is not the first element, it checks if the tens digit (`y`) is greater than or equal to the previous element in `c` and if the tens digit is less than or equal to the units digit (`x`). If both conditions are met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c`.
   - If the element is greater than 10 and it is the first element, it checks if the tens digit is less than or equal to the units digit and appends them accordingly.
   - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it is appended directly to `c`.

4. **Checking Sorted Order**: After processing the array `a` and constructing `c`, the function checks if `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version `d`. If `c` is sorted, it appends `1` to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`.

5. **Output**: After all test cases are processed, the program iterates over the list `b` and prints 'YES' for each `1` and 'NO' for each `0`.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases where the array `a` contains elements that are exactly 10. The current logic does not explicitly handle this case, but since 10 is not greater than 10, it will be appended directly to `c`, which is correct.
- **Initial State of `b`**: The list `b` is initialized outside the function and is used to store the results of each test case. This is a valid approach, but it relies on the global state of `b`, which can be a potential source of bugs if the function is reused or if `b` is modified elsewhere.
- **Function Reusability**: The function `func_1` is tightly coupled with the global list `b` and the input reading process. This makes the function less reusable and harder to test in isolation.

### Conclusion:
Despite the potential issues mentioned, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be transformed into a non-decreasing order using the specified operations. The edge cases are handled correctly, and the output matches the expected results based on the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
