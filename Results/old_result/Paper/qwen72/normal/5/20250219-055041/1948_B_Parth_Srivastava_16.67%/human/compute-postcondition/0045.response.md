Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50 and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 1 or greater than 1, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, `c` is a list that now includes the element `a[i]` at the end, `n` is `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is incremented by 1, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The new value of `n` is `n + 1`.
