Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements, where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is 0, `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`, `i` is 0, and either `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10 or `i` is not 0.**
