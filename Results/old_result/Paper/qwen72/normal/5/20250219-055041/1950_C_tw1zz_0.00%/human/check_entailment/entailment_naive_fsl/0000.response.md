Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the hour is `12` in the PM period correctly. According to the problem description, `12:00` should be `12:00 PM`, but the program incorrectly sets `time` to `AM` for `12:00`. This is a clear violation of the problem description, making the program incorrect.
