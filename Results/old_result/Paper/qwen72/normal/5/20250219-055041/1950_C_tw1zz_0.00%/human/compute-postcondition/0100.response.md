Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string, `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string, `m1` is equal to `m`. If `h` is '23', `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string. `h` is not equal to '10', '08', '07', '09', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23'.**
