### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads a time in 24-hour format `hh:mm` using `input().split(':')` and splits it into hours `h` and minutes `m`.

2. **Time Conversion**:
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the hour `h` from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
   - For hours from `01` to `11`, it sets `h1` to the same value as `h` and `time` to `AM`.
   - For hour `12`, it sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `AM`.
   - For hours from `13` to `23`, it sets `h1` to the corresponding hour in 12-hour format (e.g., `13` becomes `01`, `14` becomes `02`, etc.) and `time` to `PM`.
   - For hour `00`, it sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `PM`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the converted time in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` using `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the conversion of hours from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
- The program correctly sets the `AM` or `PM` indicator based on the hour.
- The program ensures that leading zeros are preserved in the output, as required by the problem description.
- The program handles all edge cases, such as `00:00` and `12:00`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
