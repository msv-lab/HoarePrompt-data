Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string, `m1` is equal to the minute part of the input time as a string, `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string, `h1` is '01', `time` is 'PM'.**

The code assigns the string 'PM' to the variable `time`. The other variables remain unchanged, so `t` is still an integer within the specified range, `s` is still a valid time string in the format "hh:mm", `m` and `m1` are still the minute part of the input time as strings, `h` is still the hour part of the input time as a string, and `h1` is still '01'.
