Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string, `m1` is equal to the minute part of the input time as a string, `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string, `h1` is '03', `time` is 'AM'.**

Explanation:
- The variable `time` is updated to 'AM'.
- All other variables (`t`, `s`, `m`, `m1`, `h`, `h1`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
