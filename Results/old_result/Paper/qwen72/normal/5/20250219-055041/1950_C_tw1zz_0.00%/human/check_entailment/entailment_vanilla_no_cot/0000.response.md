Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the transition from 12-hour format AM to PM correctly. Specifically, the program incorrectly sets the time to "AM" for the hour "12", which should be "PM" in the 12-hour format. Additionally, the program does not handle the transition from 12-hour format PM to AM correctly for the hour "00", which should be "AM" in the 12-hour format.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        (h1, m1) = ('', m)
        time = ''
        if h == '00':
            h1 = '12'
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == '12':
            h1 = '12'
            time = 'PM'
        elif int(h) < 12:
            h1 = h
            time = 'AM'
        else:
            h1 = str(int(h) - 12).zfill(2)
            time = 'PM'
        print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version correctly handles the transition from 12-hour format AM to PM and vice versa. It also ensures that the hour is always formatted with two digits.
