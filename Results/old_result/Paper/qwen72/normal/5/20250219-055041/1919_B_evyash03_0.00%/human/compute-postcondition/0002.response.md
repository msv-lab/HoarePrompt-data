The only objects in the loop head are `char` and `expression`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression`. If `expression` has at least one character, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `count` is 0 and `balance` is 0, but these variables are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

For the loop to execute, `expression` must be a non-empty string, and `char` will be the first character in `expression`.

State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` (1 ≤ `length` ≤ 5000) consisting only of the characters '+' and '-', `char` is the first character in `expression`, `count` is 0, `balance` is 0**
