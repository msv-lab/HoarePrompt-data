The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `expression`. The loop iterates over each character in the `expression` string. At the end of the last iteration, `char` was the first character in `expression`, and the `expression` is a string of length `length` (1 ≤ `length` ≤ 5000) consisting only of the characters '+' and '-'.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `expression` should be assigned to `char`. Since the loop has already processed the first character, the next character to be processed is the second character in the string.

State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` (1 ≤ `length` ≤ 5000) consisting only of the characters '+' and '-', `char` is the second character in `expression`**
