Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is not designed to calculate the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array optimally. Instead, it seems to be counting the number of times the balance (sum of +1 and -1) goes below zero and then adding a final check if the balance is greater than zero at the end. This approach does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty, which involves considering the sum of each subarray and its length.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Parse the input string to convert it into an array of +1 and -1.
2. Split the array into subarrays in such a way that the sum of penalties is minimized.
3. Calculate the penalty for each subarray and sum them up to get the total penalty.

A correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal splits. The current implementation does not achieve this.
