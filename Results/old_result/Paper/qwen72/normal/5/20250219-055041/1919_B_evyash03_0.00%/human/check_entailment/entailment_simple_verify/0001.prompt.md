You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

    return count + (balance > 0)
    #The program returns the sum of `count` and 1 if the final `balance` is greater than 0, otherwise it returns `count`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a string `s` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - Each `+` in the string corresponds to a value of `1` in the array `a`, and each `-` corresponds to a value of `-1`.
   - The goal is to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `expression`.
   - It then splits the string `expression` by the character `-` to get parts.
   - The `result_length` is calculated as the sum of the lengths of these parts.
   - The function `func_1` is called with `expression` and `result_length`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes `count` and `balance` to `0`.
   - It iterates through each character in the `expression`.
   - If the character is `+`, it increments `balance` by `1`.
   - If the character is `-`, it decrements `balance` by `1`.
   - If at any point `balance` becomes negative, it increments `count` by `1` and resets `balance` to `0`.
   - Finally, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`.

4. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is designed to count the number of times the balance becomes negative and reset it.
   - The `count` variable keeps track of the number of subarrays needed to keep the balance non-negative.
   - The expression `balance > 0` checks if there is any remaining positive balance after the loop, which would indicate an additional subarray is needed.

5. **Checking the Output:**
   - For the first test case `+`, the balance is `1` and `count` is `0`. The output is `0 + (1 > 0) = 1`, which is correct.
   - For the second test case `-----`, the balance becomes negative five times, so `count` is `5`. The output is `5 + (0 > 0) = 5`, which is correct.
   - For the third test case `+-+-+-`, the balance alternates between `1` and `0`, and `count` remains `0`. The output is `0 + (0 > 0) = 0`, which is correct.
   - For the fourth test case `--+++++++`, the balance becomes negative twice, so `count` is `2`. The remaining balance is `7`, so the output is `2 + (7 > 0) = 3`, but the correct output should be `4`. This indicates a potential issue.
   - For the fifth test case `+---++++-+++++---++-`, the balance becomes negative multiple times, and the final balance is positive, but the exact count and balance need to be verified.

6. **Identifying the Issue:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the case where the balance is positive but not zero. It should consider the length of the subarrays and the sum of the elements to calculate the penalty correctly.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty for all cases, especially when the balance is positive but not zero. The logic needs to be adjusted to consider the length of subarrays and the sum of elements more accurately.
