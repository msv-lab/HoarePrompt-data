Postcondition: ***`expression` is a string of length `length` (1 ≤ `length` ≤ 5000) consisting only of the characters '+' and '-', `char` is the first character in `expression`. If `balance` is less than 0, `count` is 1 and `balance` is 0. Otherwise, `count` remains 0 and `balance` is 1 if `char` is '+', or -1 if `char` is '-'***.
