Output State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` (1 ≤ `length` ≤ 5000) consisting only of the characters '+' and '-', `count` is the number of times `balance` went below 0 during the entire loop execution, and `balance` is the final balance after processing all characters in `expression`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The `expression` remains unchanged as it is the input string.
- The `count` variable will hold the number of times the `balance` went below 0 during the entire loop execution. Each time `balance` goes below 0, it is reset to 0, and `count` is incremented.
- The `balance` variable will hold the final balance after processing all characters in `expression`. This balance is the net result of adding 1 for each '+' character and subtracting 1 for each '-' character, with the constraint that `balance` is reset to 0 whenever it goes below 0.
