Postcondition: ***`expression` is a string of length `length` (1 ≤ `length` ≤ 5000) consisting only of the characters '+' and '-', `char` is the second character in `expression` (either '+' or '-'). If `char` is '+', `balance` is increased by 1. If `char` is '-', `balance` is decreased by 1. If `balance` is less than 0, `balance` is set to 0 and `count` is set to 1. Otherwise, `balance` retains its updated value and `count` is not modified.***
