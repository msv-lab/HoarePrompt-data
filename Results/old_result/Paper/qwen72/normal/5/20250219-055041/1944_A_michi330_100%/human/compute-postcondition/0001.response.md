The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0. The other variables (`n` and `k`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `i` is 0**
