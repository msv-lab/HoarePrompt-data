The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3). Since the loop increments `i` by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` also remain unchanged.**
