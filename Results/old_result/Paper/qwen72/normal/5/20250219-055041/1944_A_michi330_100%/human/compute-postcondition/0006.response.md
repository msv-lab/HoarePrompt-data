The `print(n)` statement will print the value of the variable `n`.

Based on the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer with a range of 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` and `k` are input integers.
- `k` is less than `n - 1`.

The value of `n` is not explicitly defined, but it is an input integer. Since the exact value of `n` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe it as an input integer.

Output: **n (where n is an input integer)**
