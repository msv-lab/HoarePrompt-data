Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^3), `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers.** 

The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^3, and `i` is 0. After executing the code snippet, `n` and `k` are assigned the values of two integers input by the user, while the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
