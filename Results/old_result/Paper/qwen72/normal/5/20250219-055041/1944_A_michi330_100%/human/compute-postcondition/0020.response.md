Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3). For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` is the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` is the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2). If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the function prints `1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` are no longer in scope. **
