Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `k` is the second input integer.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(n)
```

This statement will print the value of `n`, which is the first input integer. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe it as the first input integer.

Output: **n (where n is the first input integer)**
