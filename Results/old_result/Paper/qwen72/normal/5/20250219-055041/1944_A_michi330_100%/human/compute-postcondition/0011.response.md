Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` and `k` are input integers.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(n)
```

This statement will print the value of the variable `n`, which is an input integer. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe it as an input integer.

Output: **n (where n is an input integer)**
