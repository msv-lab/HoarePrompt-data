### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The function reads a binary string `s` from input.
     - It initializes `n` to 0, which will count the number of '1's encountered in the string.
     - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will accumulate the total cost of cyclic shifts.
     - The function iterates through each character in the string `s`.
       - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
       - If the character is '0' and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. This is because each '0' that appears after a '1' requires a cyclic shift to move the '1's to the right of the '0'.
     - Finally, it prints the total cost `ans`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - The function reads an integer `t` from input, which represents the number of test cases.
     - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string.
   - The cost is calculated by summing `n + 1` for each '0' that appears after a '1'. This is because each '0' that appears after a '1' requires a cyclic shift to move the '1's to the right of the '0', and the cost of each shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The algorithm handles the case where the string is already sorted (i.e., no '0' appears after a '1') by not adding any cost to `ans`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The algorithm correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000").
   - The algorithm correctly handles the case where the string has no '1's (e.g., "0000").
   - The algorithm correctly handles the case where the string has no '0's (e.g., "1111").
   - The algorithm correctly handles the case where the string has a mix of '0's and '1's (e.g., "101011").

5. **Input and Output:**
   - The input is read correctly as specified in the problem description.
   - The output is printed correctly for each test case.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  - The function reads the string `s` from input.
  - It initializes `n` to 0 and `ans` to 0.
  - The loop iterates through each character in the string `s`.
    - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
    - If the character is '0' and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
  - The final value of `ans` is printed, which represents the total cost to sort the string.

  - **Annotations:**
    - Before the function call, `s` is a binary string with a length of at least 2.
    - After the loop, `n` is the number of '1's in `s`.
    - `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' in `s` that follows at least one '1'.
    - The printed value `ans` is the total cost calculated as described.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
  - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from input.
  - It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.
  - The loop ensures that `func_1` is called the correct number of times.

  - **Annotations:**
    - Before the function call, no variables are passed to `func_2`.
    - `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
    - `func_1` is called `t` times, and each call processes a new binary string.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly solves the problem as described. The algorithm in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string, and `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
