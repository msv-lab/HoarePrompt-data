The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is read from the standard input and it is specified that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `t` is already within a valid range that ensures the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
