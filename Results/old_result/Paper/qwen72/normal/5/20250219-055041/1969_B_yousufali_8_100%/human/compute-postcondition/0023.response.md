Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads a binary string `s` from user input, where `s` consists of '0' and '1' characters and has a length of at least 2. It calculates a value `ans` based on the number of '1's (`n`) in the string and the positions of '0's that follow at least one '1'. Specifically, for each '0' that follows at least one '1', `ans` is incremented by `n + 1`. The function then prints the final value of `ans` and does not return any value. **
