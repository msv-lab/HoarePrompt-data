Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to determine the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function reads a binary string `s` from the input.
     - It initializes two variables: `n` to count the number of '1's in the string, and `ans` to store the total cost.
     - It iterates through each character in the string:
       - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
       - If the character is '0' and there have been '1's before it (`n != 0`), it increments `ans` by `n + 1`.
     - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
     - It then calls `func_1` exactly `t` times to process each test case.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - The logic in `func_1` is designed to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string.
     - The idea is to count the number of '1's (`n`) and then for each '0' that follows at least one '1', add `n + 1` to the total cost (`ans`).
     - This approach works because each '0' that follows a '1' needs to be moved to the left of all '1's, and the cost of moving each '0' is the length of the substring containing all the '1's plus the '0' itself.
     - The function correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted by not adding any cost if there are no '0's following '1's.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function correctly processes multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then calling `func_1` for each test case.
     - It ensures that `func_1` is called the correct number of times, which matches the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The functions handle the edge case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111") by not adding any cost.
   - The functions also handle the case where the string is a mix of '0's and '1's, such as "101011" or "01101001", and correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the string.

5. **Input and Output Constraints**:
   - The input constraints are respected: the number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 10^4, and the length of each string is between 2 and 2 * 10^5.
   - The sum of the lengths of all strings does not exceed 2 * 10^5, which is within the problem's constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
