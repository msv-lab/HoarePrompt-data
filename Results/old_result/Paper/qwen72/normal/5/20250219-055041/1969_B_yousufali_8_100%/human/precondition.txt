The function `solve()` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case contains a binary string `s` (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5; s_i ∈ {0, 1}) that needs to be sorted in non-descending order. The total number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
