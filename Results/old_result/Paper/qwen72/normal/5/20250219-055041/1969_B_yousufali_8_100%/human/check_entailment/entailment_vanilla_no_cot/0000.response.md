Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` attempts to calculate the cost of sorting the binary string, but it does so incorrectly. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not account for the optimal way to sort the string using cyclic shifts of substrings. Instead, it seems to count the number of '1's and add the cost whenever a '0' is encountered after a '1', which does not necessarily lead to the minimum total cost.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following:
1. If the string is already sorted, the cost is 0.
2. If the string is not sorted, we need to find the minimum cost to sort it. This can be done by identifying the positions where the string needs to be cyclically shifted to move all '1's to the right of all '0's.

A correct approach would involve:
- Finding the first '1' and the last '0' in the string.
- Calculating the cost of shifting the substring between these positions to sort the string.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_cost_to_sort(s):
    n = len(s)
    if '0' not in s or '1' not in s:
        return 0  # The string is already sorted
    first_one = s.find('1')
    last_zero = s.rfind('0')
    if first_one > last_zero:
        return 0  # The string is already sorted
    return n - (last_zero - first_one + 1) + 1

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input()
        print(min_cost_to_sort(s))

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

This corrected version correctly identifies the minimum cost to sort the binary string by finding the positions of the first '1' and the last '0' and calculating the cost based on these positions.
