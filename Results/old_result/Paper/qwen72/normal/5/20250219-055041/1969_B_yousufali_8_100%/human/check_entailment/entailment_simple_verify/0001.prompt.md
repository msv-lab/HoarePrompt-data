You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a binary string `s` and need to determine the minimum cost to sort the string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings.
   - A cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` costs `r - l + 1`.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The function reads a binary string `s` from input.
     - It initializes `n` to 0, which will count the number of '1's encountered in the string.
     - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will accumulate the total cost of cyclic shifts.
     - The function iterates through each character in the string `s`.
       - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
       - If the character is '0' and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. This is because each '0' that appears after a '1' requires a cyclic shift to move the '1's to the right of the '0'.
     - Finally, it prints the total cost `ans`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - The function reads an integer `t` from input, which represents the number of test cases.
     - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string.
   - The cost is calculated by summing `n + 1` for each '0' that appears after a '1'. This is because each '0' that appears after a '1' requires a cyclic shift to move the '1's to the right of the '0', and the cost of each shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The algorithm handles the case where the string is already sorted (i.e., no '0' appears after a '1') by not adding any cost to `ans`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The algorithm correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000").
   - The algorithm correctly handles the case where the string has no '1's (e.g., "0000").
   - The algorithm correctly handles the case where the string has no '0's (e.g., "1111").
   - The algorithm correctly handles the case where the string has a mix of '0's and '1's (e.g., "101011").

5. **Input and Output:**
   - The input is read correctly as specified in the problem description.
   - The output is printed correctly for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly solves the problem as described. The algorithm in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string, and `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
