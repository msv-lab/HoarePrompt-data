Initial State: `s` is a new binary string input by the user, with a length of at least 2; `i` is 2. If the third character of `s` is '1', `n` is incremented by 1 from its initial value, and `ans` remains 0 unless the first character of `s` is '0' and `n` was initially 1, in which case `ans` is 2. If the third character of `s` is '0' and `n` is not 0, `ans` is `n + 1` unless the first character of `s` is '0' and `n` is 1, in which case `ans` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 unless the first character of `s` is '0' and `n` is 1, in which case `ans` is 2.

Code:
```
ans += n + 1
```

Step-by-Step Impact:
1. The value of `ans` is updated by adding `n + 1` to its current value.
2. The value of `n` remains unchanged.
3. The value of `s` remains unchanged.
4. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Calculations:
- If the third character of `s` is '1', `n` is incremented by 1 from its initial value.
- If the first character of `s` is '0' and `n` was initially 1, `ans` is 2.
- If the third character of `s` is '0' and `n` is not 0, `ans` is `n + 1` unless the first character of `s` is '0' and `n` is 1, in which case `ans` is 3.
- Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 unless the first character of `s` is '0' and `n` is 1, in which case `ans` is 2.

Output State:
- If the third character of `s` is '1' and `n` was initially 1, `ans` becomes `2 + (1 + 1) = 4`.
- If the third character of `s` is '1' and `n` was initially 0, `ans` becomes `0 + (1 + 1) = 2`.
- If the third character of `s` is '0' and `n` is 1, `ans` becomes `3 + (1 + 1) = 5`.
- If the third character of `s` is '0' and `n` is not 0, `ans` becomes `(n + 1) + (n + 1) = 2n + 2`.
- If the third character of `s` is '0' and `n` is 0, `ans` remains 0.
- If the third character of `s` is '0' and `n` is 0, but the first character of `s` is '0', `ans` becomes `2 + (1 + 1) = 4`.

Output State: **`s` is a new binary string input by the user, with a length of at least 2; `i` is 2; `n` is either 0 or 1; `ans` is updated as follows: if the third character of `s` is '1' and `n` was initially 1, `ans` is 4; if the third character of `s` is '1' and `n` was initially 0, `ans` is 2; if the third character of `s` is '0' and `n` is 1, `ans` is 5; if the third character of `s` is '0' and `n` is not 0, `ans` is `2n + 2`; if the third character of `s` is '0' and `n` is 0, `ans` remains 0; if the third character of `s` is '0' and `n` is 0, but the first character of `s` is '0', `ans` is 4.**
