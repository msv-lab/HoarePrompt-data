Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the input string in `a`, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last (and only) string in the list `a` to the string `first_row`. Since `a` contains only one input string, `a[-1]` refers to that string, and `a[-1][0]` is the first character of that string. Therefore, `first_row` is now the first character of the input string in `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
