Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the input string, `last_row` is the last character of the input string, `i` is `n-1`**

The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last element in the list `a` to the string `last_row`. Since `a` is a list containing one input string, `a[-1]` refers to that string, and `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last character of that string. Therefore, `last_row` is updated to contain the last character of the input string. All other variables remain unchanged.
