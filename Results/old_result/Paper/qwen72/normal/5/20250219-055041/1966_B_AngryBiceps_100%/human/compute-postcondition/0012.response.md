Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the input string in `a` at index 0 concatenated with the first character of the input string in `a` at index 1, `last_row` is the last character of the input string in `a` at index 0 concatenated with the last character of the input string in `a` at index 1, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `last_row` is the last character of the input string in `a` at index 0.
- The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the input string in `a` at index 1 to `last_row`.
- Therefore, `last_row` is now the last character of the input string in `a` at index 0 concatenated with the last character of the input string in `a` at index 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
