Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last string in the list `a` to the variable `last_row`. Since `a` is a list containing one input string, `a[-1]` refers to this single string, and `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last character of this string. The variable `last_row` was initially an empty string, so after executing the code, `last_row` will be the last character of the string in `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
