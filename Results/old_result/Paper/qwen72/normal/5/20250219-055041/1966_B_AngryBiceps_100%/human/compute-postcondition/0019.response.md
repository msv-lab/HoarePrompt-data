Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `n` (which is a redundant condition and doesn't provide new information).
- `m` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list containing `n` input strings.
- `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each input string in `a` concatenated together.
- `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each input string in `a` concatenated together.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- The first string in `a` consists of a single repeated character.
- The last string in `a` consists of a single repeated character.
- The first string is not equal to the last string.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'` to the console. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement, as it is a constant string.

Output: **NO**
