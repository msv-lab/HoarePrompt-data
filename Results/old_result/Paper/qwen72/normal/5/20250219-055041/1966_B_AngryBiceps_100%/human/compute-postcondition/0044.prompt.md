Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, and `i` is `n-1`. If the first string in `a` and the last string in `a` each consist of a single repeated character and they are not equal, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either the first string in `a` consists of more than one unique character, or the last string in `a` consists of more than one unique character, or the first string in `a` is equal to the last string in `a`, or `first_row` and `last_row` are the same.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`, `i` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a` at index 0 plus the first character of the string in `a` at index 1, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a` at index 0 plus the last character of the string in `a` at index 1, `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is a list containing three input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a` at index 0 plus the first character of the string in `a` at index 1 plus the first character of the string in `a` at index 2, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a` at index 0 plus the last character of the string in `a` at index 1 plus the last character of the string in `a` at index 2, `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
