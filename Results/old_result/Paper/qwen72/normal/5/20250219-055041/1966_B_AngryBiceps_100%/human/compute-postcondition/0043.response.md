Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is a list containing three input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a` at index 0 plus the first character of the string in `a` at index 1 plus the first character of the string in `a` at index 2, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a` at index 0 plus the last character of the string in `a` at index 1 plus the last character of the string in `a` at index 2, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- `last_row` is updated by appending the last character of the string in `a` at the last index (`a[-1][-1]`).
- The previous value of `last_row` was the last character of the string in `a` at index 0 plus the last character of the string in `a` at index 1.
- After the update, `last_row` now includes the last character of the string in `a` at index 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `i`) remain unchanged.
