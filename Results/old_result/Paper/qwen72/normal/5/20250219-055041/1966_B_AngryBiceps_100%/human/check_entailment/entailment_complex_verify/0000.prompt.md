You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes a grid of characters 'W' and 'B' representing white and black squares, respectively. The grid is defined by its dimensions n and m, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500. The total number of test cases, t, is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)
            ) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The total number of test cases `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers for each test case, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings for each test case, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each input string in `a` concatenated together for each test case, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each input string in `a` concatenated together for each test case, and `i` is `n-1` for each test case. For each test case, if the first string in `a` and the last string in `a` each consist of a single repeated character and they are not equal, or if `first_row` and `last_row` each consist of a single repeated character and they are not equal, then the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, the program prints 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing a grid of characters 'W' and 'B' with dimensions `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500). For each test case, it reads the grid and checks two conditions: 
1. If the first row and the last row of the grid each consist of a single repeated character and these characters are different.
2. If the first column and the last column of the grid each consist of a single repeated character and these characters are different.
If either condition is true, the function prints 'NO' for that test case. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value. The total number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of `n * m` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails when the grid can be made uniform by selecting any two squares of the same color, but the first and last rows or columns are not uniform. For example, consider the following grid:

```
3 3
BWB
WBW
BWB
```

In this case, the grid can be made entirely white by selecting the top-left and bottom-right corners (both 'B'), but the program will incorrectly output "NO" because it checks only the first and last rows and columns for uniformity, which are not uniform in this case. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
