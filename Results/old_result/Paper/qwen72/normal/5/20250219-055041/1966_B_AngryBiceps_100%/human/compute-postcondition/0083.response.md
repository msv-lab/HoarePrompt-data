Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing a grid of characters 'W' and 'B' with dimensions `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500). For each test case, it reads the grid and checks two conditions: 
1. If the first row and the last row of the grid each consist of a single repeated character and these characters are different.
2. If the first column and the last column of the grid each consist of a single repeated character and these characters are different.
If either condition is true, the function prints 'NO' for that test case. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value. The total number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of `n * m` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. **
