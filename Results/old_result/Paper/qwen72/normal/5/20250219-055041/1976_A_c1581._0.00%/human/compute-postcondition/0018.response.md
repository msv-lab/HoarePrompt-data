The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `char`, and the string `password`. For the loop to execute, `password` must be a non-empty string. The variables `i` and `char` will be set by the `enumerate` function during the loop's execution, starting with `i` as 0 and `char` as the first character of `password`.

Given the initial state:
- `password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
- `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` string in the order they appear.
- `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string in the order they appear.
- `last_digit_index` is -1.

For the loop to execute, `password` must have at least one character. The `enumerate` function will set `i` to 0 and `char` to the first character of `password` at the start of the loop.

State: **`password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character of `password`**
