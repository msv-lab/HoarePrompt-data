To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the variables and objects that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for char in password:
```

The only variable in the loop head is `char`, and the object being iterated over is `password`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `password` is a string of length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
- `char` is the second character of `password`.
- If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first and second characters of `password`, and `letters` is an empty list.
- If `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` is an empty list, and `letters` is a list containing the first and second characters of `password`.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `char` will be the third character of `password`.
- The length of `password` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`password` is a string of length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, and `char` is the third character of `password`. If the third character of `password` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first and second characters of `password`, and `letters` is an empty list. If the third character of `password` is a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` is an empty list, and `letters` is a list containing the first and second characters of `password`.**
