Postcondition: **`password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `i` is n-1, `char` is the last character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is set to n-1. If `char` is not a digit and `last_digit_index` is not -1, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password` or -1 if no digit is found. Additionally, the list `digits` is sorted. The list `letters` is not sorted.**
