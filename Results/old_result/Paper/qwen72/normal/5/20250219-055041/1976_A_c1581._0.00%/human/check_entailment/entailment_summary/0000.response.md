Reasoning:  
The program is designed to verify if a given password meets the specified conditions. Let's break down the logic and check if it correctly implements the requirements:

1. **Separation of Digits and Letters:**
   - The function `func_1` separates the characters in the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`. This is done by iterating through each character in the password and checking if it is a digit using `char.isdigit()`. If it is a digit, it is added to the `digits` list; otherwise, it is added to the `letters` list.

2. **Checking for Digits After Letters:**
   - The function then iterates through the password again to check if there is any digit that appears after a letter. This is done by maintaining a `last_digit_index` variable that keeps track of the last index where a digit was found. If a letter is found after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not `-1`), the function returns 'NO'.

3. **Sorting Check for Digits and Letters:**
   - The function checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to `sorted(digits)`. If they are not the same, the function returns 'NO'.
   - Similarly, the function checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to `sorted(letters)`. If they are not the same, the function returns 'NO'.

4. **Final Return:**
   - If all the conditions are met, the function returns 'YES'.

The program reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases. It correctly splits the input into the number of test cases and the individual passwords, and then applies the `func_1` function to each password to determine if it is strong.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the required conditions for a strong password. It ensures that:
- There are no digits after letters.
- All digits are in non-decreasing order.
- All letters are in non-decreasing order.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
