Output State: **`password` is a string of length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the second character of `password`, `digits` is an empty list, `letters` is a list containing the first character and the second character of `password`.**

Explanation:
- The code `letters.append(char)` adds the second character of `password` to the `letters` list.
- Initially, `char` is the second character of `password`.
- If `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` is an empty list, and `letters` contains the first character of `password`.
- After appending `char` to `letters`, the `letters` list now contains both the first and second characters of `password`.
- The `digits` list remains empty.
- The `password` string and its length `n` remain unchanged.
