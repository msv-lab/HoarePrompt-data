You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: `password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` string in the order they appear. `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string in the order they appear.
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: `password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `i` is n-1, `char` is the last character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is set to n-1. If `char` is not a digit and `last_digit_index` is not -1, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password` or -1 if no digit is found.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'.
    #State: `password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `i` is n-1, `char` is the last character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is set to n-1. If `char` is not a digit and `last_digit_index` is not -1, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password` or -1 if no digit is found. Additionally, the list `digits` is sorted.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `i` is n-1, `char` is the last character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is set to n-1. If `char` is not a digit and `last_digit_index` is not -1, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password` or -1 if no digit is found. Additionally, the list `digits` is sorted. The list `letters` is sorted.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `password`, which is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It returns 'NO' if the password does not meet certain criteria, and returns 'YES' if it meets a specific set of criteria.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'NO'.

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'

Case_3: The program returns 'NO'

Case_4: The program returns 'NO'.

Case_5: The program returns 'NO'

Case_6: The program returns 'YES'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
