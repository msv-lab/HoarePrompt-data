Output State: **`password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` string in the order they appear. `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string in the order they appear.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `digits` list will contain all the digit characters from the `password` string in the order they appear in the string, and the `letters` list will contain all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string in the order they appear in the string. The `password` string itself remains unchanged.
