The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `password`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `password`. If `password` has at least one character, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, which ensures that `password` is not empty. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `password` has at least one character. The variable `char` will be the first character of `password` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the first character of `password`, `digits` is an empty list, `letters` is an empty list**
