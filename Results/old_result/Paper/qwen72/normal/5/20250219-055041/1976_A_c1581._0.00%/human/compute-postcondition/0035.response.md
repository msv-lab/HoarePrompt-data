Postcondition: ***`password` is a string of length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `i` is 2, `char` is the third character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is set to 2. If `char` is not a digit and `last_digit_index` is not -1, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, `last_digit_index` remains -1.***
