Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes the test cases one by one.

2. **Test Case Loop**: For each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself, and then calls the `func_1` function to check if the password is strong.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Character Classification**: It separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - **Digit Placement Check**: It ensures that no digit comes after a letter by tracking the last index of a digit. If a letter is found after a digit, it returns 'NO'.
   - **Sorting Check**: It checks if the `digits` list and the `letters` list are sorted in non-decreasing order. If either list is not sorted, it returns 'NO'.
   - **Final Check**: If all conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem description and produces the correct output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
