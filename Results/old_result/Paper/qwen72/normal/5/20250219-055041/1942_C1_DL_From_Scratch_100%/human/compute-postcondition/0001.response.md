To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` and `T`.

- The variable `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted.
- The variable `T` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `T` is a positive integer. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0**
