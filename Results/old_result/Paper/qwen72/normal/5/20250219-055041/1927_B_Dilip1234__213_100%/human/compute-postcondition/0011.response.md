Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is the string 'ab', `char_count[j]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `char_count[j] += 1` increments the value of the element in the `char_count` list at index `j` by 1. Since `j` is 1, `char_count[1]` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `s`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this update.
