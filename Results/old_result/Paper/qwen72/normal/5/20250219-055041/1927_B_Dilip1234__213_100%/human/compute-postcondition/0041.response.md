Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' followed by the character 'a'. Additionally, the current value of `char_count[j]` is equal to the value of `a[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged.
- The value of `j` remains unchanged.
- The string `s` is updated by appending the character corresponding to `chr(j + ord('a'))`. Since `j` is 0, `chr(0 + ord('a'))` is 'a'. Therefore, `s` becomes 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' followed by 'a'.
- The value of `char_count[j]` remains equal to the value of `a[i]`.
