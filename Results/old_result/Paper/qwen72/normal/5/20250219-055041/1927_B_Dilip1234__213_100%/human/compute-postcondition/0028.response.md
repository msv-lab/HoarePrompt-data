Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s += chr(j + ord('a'))` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j + ord('a')` to the string `s`. Since `j` is 1, `ord('a')` is 97, and `j + ord('a')` is 98, the character 'b' is appended to the string `s`. Therefore, `s` becomes 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzb'. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
