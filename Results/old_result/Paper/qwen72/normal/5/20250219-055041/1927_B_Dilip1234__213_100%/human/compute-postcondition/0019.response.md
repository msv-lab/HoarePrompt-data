Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `i` is 0, `j` is 25, and `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i]` for any `j` from 0 to 25, then `char_count[j]` is incremented by 1, and the corresponding character is appended to `s`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs 26 times, from `j = 0` to `j = 25`.
- Each time the loop runs, it checks if `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i]`.
- If the condition is true, it appends the character corresponding to `j` (i.e., `chr(j + ord('a'))`) to the string `s`, increments `char_count[j]` by 1, and breaks out of the loop.
- Since `i` remains 0 throughout the loop, the condition `char_count[j] == a[i]` is checked for each `j` from 0 to 25.
- Assuming `char_count[j]` is initially set such that `char_count[j] == a[i]` for each `j` in the range, the loop will append each character from 'a' to 'z' to `s` in sequence.
- After 26 iterations, `j` will be 25, and `s` will be the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
