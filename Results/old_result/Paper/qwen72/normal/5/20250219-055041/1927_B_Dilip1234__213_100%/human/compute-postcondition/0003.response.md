The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range `26`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute 26 times regardless of the values of `n` and `i` because the range is fixed at 26. However, we need to ensure that the loop can start, which means `j` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
