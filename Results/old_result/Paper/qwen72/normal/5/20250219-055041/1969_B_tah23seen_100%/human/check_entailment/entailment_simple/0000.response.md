**Reasoning:**

The program aims to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The logic of the function `func_1` is as follows:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `cost` is initialized to 0, which will store the total cost of the operations.
   - `one` is initialized to 0, which will count the number of consecutive '1's encountered.

2. **Loop through the string:**
   - For each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is '1', increment the `one` counter.
     - If `i` is '0' and there are some '1's counted (`one > 0`), add `one + 1` to the `cost`. This is because a cyclic shift of a substring containing the last '1' and the current '0' will move the '1' to the end, and the cost of this operation is the length of the substring, which is `one + 1`.

3. **Return the cost:**
   - After the loop, the function returns the accumulated `cost`.

The logic of the function is correct for the problem at hand. Hereâ€™s why:

- **Handling '1's and '0's:**
  - The function correctly identifies the cost of moving '1's to the end of the string by counting consecutive '1's and adding the cost when a '0' is encountered.
  - This ensures that the string is sorted in non-descending order by minimizing the number of operations needed.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the function will correctly return 0 because no '1's will be followed by '0's.
  - If the string is a mix of '0's and '1's, the function will correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the string.

- **Complexity:**
  - The function runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the string, which is efficient given the constraints.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string.

**Correctness: **True****
