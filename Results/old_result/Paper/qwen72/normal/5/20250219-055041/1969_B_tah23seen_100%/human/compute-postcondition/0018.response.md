Postcondition: ***`s` is a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5; s_i ∈ {0, 1}), `i` is the third character of `s`. If `i` is '1', then `cost` is 3 and `one` is 2. If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, then `cost` is 2 and `one` is 0. If `i` is '0' and `one` is 0, then `cost` is 1 and `one` is 0.***
