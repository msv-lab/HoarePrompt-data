The code snippet `cost += one + 1` updates the value of `cost` by adding `one + 1` to its current value. Let's evaluate the impact of this code based on the initial state.

Initial State:
- `s` is a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5; s_i ∈ {0, 1})
- `i` is the third character of `s`
- If `i` is '1', then `cost` is 0 and `one` is 2
- If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, then `cost` is 1 and `one` is 0
- If `i` is '0' and `one` is 0, then `cost` remains 0 and `one` is 0

Step-by-step evaluation:
1. **If `i` is '1':**
   - `cost` is 0
   - `one` is 2
   - `cost += one + 1` results in `cost` becoming `0 + 2 + 1 = 3`
   - Updated values: `cost` is 3, `one` is 2

2. **If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0:**
   - `cost` is 1
   - `one` is 0
   - `cost += one + 1` results in `cost` becoming `1 + 0 + 1 = 2`
   - Updated values: `cost` is 2, `one` is 0

3. **If `i` is '0' and `one` is 0:**
   - `cost` is 0
   - `one` is 0
   - `cost += one + 1` results in `cost` becoming `0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
   - Updated values: `cost` is 1, `one` is 0

Output State: **`s` is a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5; s_i ∈ {0, 1}), `i` is the third character of `s`. If `i` is '1', then `cost` is 3 and `one` is 2. If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, then `cost` is 2 and `one` is 0. If `i` is '0' and `one` is 0, then `cost` is 1 and `one` is 0.**
