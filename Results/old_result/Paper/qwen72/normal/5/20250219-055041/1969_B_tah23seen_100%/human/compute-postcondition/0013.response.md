Postcondition: ***`s` is a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5; s_i ∈ {0, 1}), `i` is the second character of `s`. If `i` is '1', then `cost` is 0 and `one` is 1. If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, `cost` is set to 1 and `one` is 0. If `i` is '0' and `one` is 0, `cost` remains 0 and `one` is 0.***
