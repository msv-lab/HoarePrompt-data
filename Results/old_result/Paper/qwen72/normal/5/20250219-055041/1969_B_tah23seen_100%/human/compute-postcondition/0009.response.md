Postcondition: ***`s` is a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5; s_i ∈ {0, 1}), `i` is the first character of `s`. If `i` is '1', then `cost` is 0 and `one` is 1. If `i` is '0', then `cost` is 0 or 1, and `one` is 0. Specifically, if `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, `cost` is set to 1; otherwise, `cost` remains 0.***
