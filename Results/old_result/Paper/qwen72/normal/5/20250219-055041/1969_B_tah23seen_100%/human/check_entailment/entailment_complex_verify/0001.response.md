### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires sorting a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of all operations.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The function `func_1(s)` is designed to calculate the minimum total cost to sort the binary string `s`.
   - The function iterates through the string `s` and maintains two variables:
     - `cost`: The total cost of the operations.
     - `one`: The count of '1's encountered so far in the string.
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is '1', it increments the `one` counter.
     - If the character is '0' and there are '1's before it (i.e., `one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic of adding `one + 1` to the `cost` when a '0' is encountered after some '1's is based on the idea that to move all '1's before the '0', we need to perform a cyclic shift on the substring that includes the '0' and all the '1's before it.
   - The length of this substring is `one + 1` (one for each '1' and one for the '0').
   - This approach ensures that each '0' is moved to the correct position with the minimum cost.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the function correctly returns 0 because no operations are needed.
   - If the string has no '0's (e.g., "1111"), the function correctly returns 0 because no operations are needed.
   - If the string has no '1's (e.g., "0000"), the function correctly returns 0 because no operations are needed.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For "10", the function correctly returns 2.
     - The string is "10".
     - The first character is '1', so `one` becomes 1.
     - The second character is '0', and since `one` is 1, the cost becomes 1 + 1 = 2.
     - Final cost: 2.
   - For "0000", the function correctly returns 0.
     - The string is "0000".
     - There are no '1's, so the cost remains 0.
     - Final cost: 0.
   - For "11000", the function correctly returns 9.
     - The string is "11000".
     - The first two characters are '1', so `one` becomes 2.
     - The third character is '0', and since `one` is 2, the cost becomes 2 + 1 = 3.
     - The fourth and fifth characters are '0', and since `one` is 2, the cost becomes 3 + (2 + 1) + (2 + 1) = 9.
     - Final cost: 9.
   - For "101011", the function correctly returns 5.
     - The string is "101011".
     - The first character is '1', so `one` becomes 1.
     - The second character is '0', and since `one` is 1, the cost becomes 1 + 1 = 2.
     - The third character is '1', so `one` becomes 2.
     - The fourth character is '0', and since `one` is 2, the cost becomes 2 + (2 + 1) = 5.
     - The fifth and sixth characters are '1', so `one` becomes 4.
     - Final cost: 5.
   - For "01101001", the function correctly returns 11.
     - The string is "01101001".
     - The first character is '0', so `one` remains 0.
     - The second and third characters are '1', so `one` becomes 2.
     - The fourth character is '0', and since `one` is 2, the cost becomes 2 + 1 = 3.
     - The fifth character is '1', so `one` becomes 3.
     - The sixth and seventh characters are '0', and since `one` is 3, the cost becomes 3 + (3 + 1) + (3 + 1) = 11.
     - The eighth character is '1', so `one` becomes 4.
     - Final cost: 11.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`, because it iterates through the string once.
   - The space complexity is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of extra space.

### Final Evaluation:
The provided program correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using the described cyclic shift operations. The logic and implementation are sound and handle all edge cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
