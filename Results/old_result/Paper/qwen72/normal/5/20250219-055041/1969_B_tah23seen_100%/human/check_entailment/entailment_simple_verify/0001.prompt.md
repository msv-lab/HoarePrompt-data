You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    return cost



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5; s_i ∈ {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
        
    #State: `s` is a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5; s_i ∈ {0, 1}), `cost` is the total cost accumulated based on the loop logic, and `one` is the count of consecutive '1's at the end of the string.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total cost accumulated based on the loop logic.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of all operations.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The function `func_1(s)` is designed to calculate the minimum total cost to sort the binary string `s`.
   - The function iterates through the string `s` and maintains two variables:
     - `cost`: The total cost of the operations.
     - `one`: The count of '1's encountered so far in the string.
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is '1', it increments the `one` counter.
     - If the character is '0' and there are '1's before it (i.e., `one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic of adding `one + 1` to the `cost` when a '0' is encountered after some '1's is based on the idea that to move all '1's before the '0', we need to perform a cyclic shift on the substring that includes the '0' and all the '1's before it.
   - The length of this substring is `one + 1` (one for each '1' and one for the '0').
   - This approach ensures that each '0' is moved to the correct position with the minimum cost.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the function correctly returns 0 because no operations are needed.
   - If the string has no '0's (e.g., "1111"), the function correctly returns 0 because no operations are needed.
   - If the string has no '1's (e.g., "0000"), the function correctly returns 0 because no operations are needed.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`, because it iterates through the string once.
   - The space complexity is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of extra space.

6. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For "10", the function correctly returns 2.
   - For "0000", the function correctly returns 0.
   - For "11000", the function correctly returns 9.
   - For "101011", the function correctly returns 5.
   - For "01101001", the function correctly returns 11.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using the described cyclic shift operations. The logic and implementation are sound and handle all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
