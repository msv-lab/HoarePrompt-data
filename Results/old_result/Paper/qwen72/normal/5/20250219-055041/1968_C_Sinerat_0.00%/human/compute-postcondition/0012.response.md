Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `a[1]` is set to `a[0] + x[0]`.
- `a[2]` is set to `a[1] + x[1]`.
- ...
- `a[n-1]` is set to `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.

### Explanation:
1. **List `a` and `x`**:
   - The list `a` is defined such that each element from `a[1]` to `a[n-1]` is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`.
   - The list `x` is not explicitly defined, but it is implied that `x` has at least `n-1` elements.

2. **List `a` Construction**:
   - `a[1] = a[0] + x[0]`
   - `a[2] = a[1] + x[1]`
   - ...
   - `a[n-1] = a[n-2] + x[n-2]`

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
- **First Element**:
  - `a[0]` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume it is an initial value, say `a[0] = A`.
- **Subsequent Elements**:
  - `a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = A + x[0]`
  - `a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = (A + x[0]) + x[1] = A + x[0] + x[1]`
  - ...
  - `a[n-1] = a[n-2] + x[n-2] = (A + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-3]) + x[n-2] = A + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]`

### Final Output:
The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces. Each element of `a` is constructed based on the initial value `A` and the cumulative sum of elements from the list `x`.

Output: **A, A + x[0], A + x[0] + x[1], ..., A + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]** (where `A` is the initial value of `a[0]` and `x` is a list of integers)
