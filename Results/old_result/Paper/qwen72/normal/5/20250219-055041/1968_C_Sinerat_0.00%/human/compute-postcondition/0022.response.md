The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an input integer greater than 2. Since the loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`, the next iteration will increment `i` by 1 to 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than `i`, which is now 3. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 3.

The state of `a` and `x` do not affect the loop condition, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of `n` zeros with `a[0]` set to 500, `a[1]` set to `500 + x[0]`, and `a[2]` set to `500 + x[0] + x[1]`, `x` is a list of integers.**
