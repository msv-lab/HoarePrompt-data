The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because `range(1, n)` generates numbers from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is a placeholder (not relevant to the loop head).
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `x` is a list of integers provided by the user (not relevant to the loop head).
- `a` is a list of length `n` where the first element is 500 and the rest are 0 (not relevant to the loop head).

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` should start at 1, which is the first value in the range.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
