The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is the new input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is the new input integer greater than 1, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500, the second element is 500 + `x[0]`, the third element is 500 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, and the rest are 0, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
