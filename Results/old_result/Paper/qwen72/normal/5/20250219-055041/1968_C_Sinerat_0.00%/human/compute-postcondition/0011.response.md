Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a[1]` is set to `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is set to `a[1] + x[1]`, ..., `a[n-1]` is set to `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `n` must be a positive integer greater than 0.
- The loop index `i` will be `n-1` (the last index in the range from 1 to `n-1`).
- The list `a` will have its elements updated such that each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is set to the value of the previous element `a[i-1]` plus the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the list `x`.
