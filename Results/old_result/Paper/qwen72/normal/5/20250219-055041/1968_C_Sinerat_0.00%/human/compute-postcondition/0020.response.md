The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of `n` zeros with `a[0]` set to 500 and `a[1]` set to `500 + x[0]`, `x` is a list of integers.**
