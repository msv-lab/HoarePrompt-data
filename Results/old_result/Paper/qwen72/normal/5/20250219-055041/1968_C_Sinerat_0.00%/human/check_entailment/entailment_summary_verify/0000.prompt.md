You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 500
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of integers `x`. For each test case, it generates a list `a` of `n` integers where the first element is 500, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` from `x[0]` to `x[i-1]` added to 500. The function prints the list `a` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the number of test cases `t` is implicitly reduced to 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the initial value of `a[0]` is set to 500. This can lead to incorrect results if the input values for `x` are such that the conditions cannot be met with `a[0]` fixed at 500. For example, consider the input:

```
1
3
1 1
```

The program will set `a[0]` to 500, `a[1]` to 501, and `a[2]` to 502. However, this does not satisfy the condition `a_3 % a_2 = 1` because `502 % 501 = 1`, but `a_2 % a_1` should also equal 1, and `501 % 500 = 1` is not necessarily true for all inputs. A correct solution should allow `a[0]` to be any value that can satisfy the conditions for the given `x` values.
