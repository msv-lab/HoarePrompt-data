Output State: **`n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x` (i.e., `a[i] = 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[i-1]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`), and `x` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `n` remains the same as the input integer greater than 0.
- The value of `i` is `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `a`.
- The list `a` now has `n` elements, where the first element is 500, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x` up to that point.
- The list `x` remains unchanged and is still the list of integers provided by the user.
