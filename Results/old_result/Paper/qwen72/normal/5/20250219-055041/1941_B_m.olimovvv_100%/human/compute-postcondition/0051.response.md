Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is at least 3, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `a - 2`, `b[0]` to `b[a-3]` are all 0, `b[a-2]` is `b[a-2] - 2 * b[a-3]`, and `b[a-1]` is `b[a-1] - b[a-3]`. If any element in `b` from `b[0]` to `b[a-2]` was less than 0 during the loop, the loop would have terminated early with a 'NO' output. If `b[-1]` or `b[-2]` are not 0 after the loop, the output will be 'NO'. Otherwise, the output will be 'YES'.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- The variable `n` remains an integer between 3 and 200,000.
- The variable `a` is at least 3.
- The list `b` is still a list of integers input by the user.
- The loop index `i` is `a - 2`, meaning the loop has run from `i = 0` to `i = a - 3`.
- The elements `b[0]` to `b[a-3]` are all set to 0.
- The element `b[a-2]` is updated to `b[a-2] - 2 * b[a-3]`.
- The element `b[a-1]` is updated to `b[a-1] - b[a-3]`.
- If any element in `b` from `b[0]` to `b[a-2]` was less than 0 during the loop, the loop would have stopped and printed 'NO'.
- If the last two elements of `b` (`b[-1]` and `b[-2]`) are not 0 after the loop, the output will be 'NO'.
- If both `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` are 0 after the loop, the output will be 'YES'.
