The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `a`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `a - 2`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `a` is an integer greater than 2

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `a` must still be greater than 2 to ensure that `i` is less than `a - 2`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `a` is an integer greater than 2

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `b[0]` to `b[a-3]` are all 0, `b[a-2]` is `b[a-2] - 2 * b[a-3]`, `b[a-1]` is `b[a-1] - b[a-3]`, `b[1]` is `b[1] - 2 * b[0]`, `b[2]` is `b[2] - b[0]`, `b[2]` is `b[2] - 2 * b[1]`, `b[3]` is `b[3] - b[1]`, `b[1]` is 0**
