Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_j` is an integer such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - (b[i] * 2)`, `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - b[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and the list `b` remain unchanged. The value of `i` remains 1. The value of `b[i]` remains 0. The value of `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - (b[i] * 2)`, and the value of `b[i + 2]` is updated to `b[i + 2] - b[i]`. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is directly inside.
