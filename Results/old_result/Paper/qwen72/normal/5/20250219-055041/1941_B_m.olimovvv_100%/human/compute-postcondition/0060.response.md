Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0, `b[0]` to `b[a-3]` are all 0, `b[a-2]` is `b[a-2] - 2 * b[a-3]`, `b[a-1]` is `b[a-1] - b[a-3]`, `b[1]` is `b[1] - 2 * b[0]`. If `b[0]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` updates the value of `b[1]` by subtracting `2 * b[0]` from it.
- Since `i` is 0, `b[1]` is updated to `b[1] - 2 * b[0]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and the initial conditions for `b[0]` to `b[a-3]`, `b[a-2]`, and `b[a-1]` remain unchanged.
- The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement (`b[0]` is less than 0) is still valid and remains unchanged.
