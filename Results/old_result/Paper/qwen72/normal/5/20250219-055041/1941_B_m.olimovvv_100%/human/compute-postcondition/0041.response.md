Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is at least 3, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `b[0]` is 0, `b[2]` is updated to `b[2] - b[0]`, and `b[2]` is now `b[2] - b[1] * 2`. If `b[1]` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
