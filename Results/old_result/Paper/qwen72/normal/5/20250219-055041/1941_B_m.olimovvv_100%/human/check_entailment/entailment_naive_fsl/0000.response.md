Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array has elements that cannot be reduced to zero using the described operations. Specifically, the program only checks if the last two elements are zero after attempting to reduce the array, but it does not ensure that the entire array can be reduced to zero.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
5
1 3 5 5 2
5
2 4 4 5 1
5
0 1 3 3 1
```

The program will output:
```
YES
NO
YES
```

However, for the second test case `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it does not correctly handle the reduction process. The correct output should be "NO" because it is impossible to reduce the array to all zeros using the described operations. The program fails to correctly identify this case.
