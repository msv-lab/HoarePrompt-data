Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the minimum number of days required to transform the initial state of cats in boxes (`s1`) to the desired state (`s2`). The operations allowed are:
1. Adding a cat to an empty box.
2. Removing a cat from a box.
3. Moving a cat from one box to another.

The function `func_1` calculates the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) and the number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`). The key insight here is that the minimum number of days required to achieve the desired state is the maximum of these two values. This is because:
- If more cats need to be added than removed, the scientists will need to perform the necessary additions, which will take at least as many days as the number of cats to add.
- If more cats need to be removed than added, the scientists will need to perform the necessary removals, which will take at least as many days as the number of cats to remove.
- If the number of cats to add and remove is the same, the scientists can perform these operations in parallel, but the total number of days required will still be the same as the number of cats to add or remove.

The function correctly counts the number of cats to add and remove and returns the maximum of these two values. This approach ensures that the minimum number of days required to achieve the desired state is calculated accurately.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided.

Correctness: **True**
