Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `favorite_value` is the integer at index `f - 1` in the list `a`, `same_value_count` is the number of times the `favorite_value` appears in the list `a`, `greater_count` is the number of elements in the list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, and `greater_count` is less than `k`. Additionally, `greater_count + same_value_count` is greater than `k`.***
