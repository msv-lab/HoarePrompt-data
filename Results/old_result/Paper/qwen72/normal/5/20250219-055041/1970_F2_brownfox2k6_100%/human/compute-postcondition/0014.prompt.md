Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a non-negative integer representing the current step in the game, `out` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for p in player:
    if player[p] == blud:
        out.append(p)
        player[p] = [-1, -1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a non-negative integer, `out` is a list, `player` is an iterable with at least one element, and `p` is the first element of `player`. If the element at the index `p` in `player` is `blud`, `out` contains the first element of `player`, and the element at the index `p` in `player` is now `[-1, -1]`. Otherwise, `out` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a non-negative integer, `out` is a list, `player` is an iterable with at least two elements, and `p` is the second element of `player`. If the second element of `player` is equal to `blud`, `out` contains the second element of `player`, and the second element of `player` is updated to `[-1, -1]`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a non-negative integer, `out` is a list, `player` is an iterable with at least three elements, and `p` is the third element of `player`. If the third element of `player` is equal to `blud`, `out` contains the third element of `player` before the update, and the third element of `player` is now `[-1, -1]`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
