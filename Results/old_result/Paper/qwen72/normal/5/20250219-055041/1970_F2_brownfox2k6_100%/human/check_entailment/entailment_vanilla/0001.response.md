### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game is played on a rectangular field with dimensions \(N \times M\).
   - There are two teams, Red (R) and Blue (B), each with up to 10 players.
   - The field contains goals for each team, a Quaffle, and a Bludger.
   - Players can move, catch the Quaffle, and throw the Quaffle.
   - If a player is on the same cell as a Bludger, they are eliminated.
   - Scoring a goal in the opponent's goal gives a point to the player's team.
   - Scoring in the wrong goal (own goal) gives a point to the opposing team.
   - The Quaffle returns to the center of the field after a goal is scored.
   - The game has \(T\) steps, and each step involves an action by an entity.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function updates the position of an entity (player or ball) based on the direction provided.
     - It correctly handles the four possible directions: 'U' (up), 'D' (down), 'L' (left), and 'R' (right).
     - The function modifies the position of the entity in place.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function checks if any player is on the same cell as the Bludger and prints the elimination event.
     - It iterates over the `player` dictionary to find players at the same position as the Bludger.
     - It sets the position of the eliminated player to `[-1, -1]` to mark them as out of the game.
     - It prints the elimination events in alphabetical order.

3. **Identifying Missing Components:**
   - The program does not handle the initial setup of the field, including the positions of players, goals, the Quaffle, and the Bludger.
   - The program does not handle the main game loop where actions are processed.
   - The program does not handle scoring, the movement of the Quaffle after a goal, or the final score output.

4. **Correctness Evaluation:**
   - The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correct for their intended purposes:
     - `func_1` correctly updates the position of an entity.
     - `func_2` correctly identifies and prints the elimination of players.
   - However, the program is incomplete and does not cover the entire problem description, including the main game logic and scoring.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incomplete and lacks the necessary components to fully solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect in the context of the entire problem.

Correctness: **False**
