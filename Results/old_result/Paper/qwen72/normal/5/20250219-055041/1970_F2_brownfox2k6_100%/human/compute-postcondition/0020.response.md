Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **`t`**: This is a non-negative integer. The exact value of `t` is not specified, so we can only describe it as a non-negative integer.

2. **`out`**: This is a list containing all the keys from the dictionary `player` whose values were equal to `blud` before the loop started. It is mentioned that `out` must have at least three elements.

3. **`p`**: This is the third element in the sorted `out`. Since `out` contains keys from `player`, and it must have at least three elements, `p` will be the third key in the sorted list of these keys.

4. **`player`**: This is a dictionary where the values of the keys that were equal to `blud` are now `[-1, -1]`. The values of other keys remain unchanged.

5. **`blud`**: This is a value that was used to filter the keys in `player` to create the list `out`.

Given the initial state, the `print` statement will output the value of `t`, the third element in the sorted `out` list, and the string 'ELIMINATED'.

Since `out` must have at least three elements, and `p` is the third element in the sorted `out`, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **t, p, ELIMINATED (where t is a non-negative integer and p is the third element in the sorted list of keys from `player` whose values were equal to `blud` before the loop started)**
