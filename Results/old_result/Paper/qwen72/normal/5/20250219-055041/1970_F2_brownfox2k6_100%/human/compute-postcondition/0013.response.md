Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-negative integer, `out` is a list, `player` is an iterable with at least three elements, and `p` is the third element of `player`. If the third element of `player` is equal to `blud`, `out` contains the third element of `player` before the update, and the third element of `player` is now `[-1, -1]`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
