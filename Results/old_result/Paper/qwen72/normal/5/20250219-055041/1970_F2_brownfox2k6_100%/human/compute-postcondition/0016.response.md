Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a non-negative integer.
   - `out` is a list containing all the keys from `player` whose values were equal to `blud` before the loop started.
   - The values of these keys in `player` are now `[-1, -1]`.
   - The values of other keys in `player` that were not equal to `blud` remain unchanged.
   - `out` must have at least one element.
   - `p` is the first element in the sorted `out`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `t` is a non-negative integer, so it will print its current value.
   - `out` is a list of keys from `player` whose values were equal to `blud` before the loop started. Since `out` must have at least one element, we know it is not empty.
   - `p` is the first element in the sorted `out`. This means `p` will be the smallest key in the list `out` when sorted in ascending order.
   - The string `'ELIMINATED'` will be printed as is.

4. **Output:**
   - The value of `t` will be printed as a non-negative integer.
   - The value of `p` will be printed as the smallest key in the list `out`.
   - The string `'ELIMINATED'` will be printed.

Therefore, the final output will be:
Output: **t, p, ELIMINATED (where t is a non-negative integer and p is the smallest key in the list `out`)**
