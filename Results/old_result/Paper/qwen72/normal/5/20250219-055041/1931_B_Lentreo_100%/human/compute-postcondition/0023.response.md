Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of non-negative integers `nums` where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by the length of the list. It returns 'NO' if the sum of the deviations of the elements from the mean (calculated as the integer division of the total sum by the length of the list) is negative at any point during the iteration through the list. If the sum of the deviations remains non-negative throughout the iteration, the function returns 'YES'. **
