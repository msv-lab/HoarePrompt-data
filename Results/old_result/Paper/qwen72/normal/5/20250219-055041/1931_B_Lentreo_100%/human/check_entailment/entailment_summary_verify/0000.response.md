### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate or not.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the operation of pouring water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index. The key points are:
1. The sum of the amounts of water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers.
2. The operation can only pour water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases, the number of containers for each test case, and the initial amounts of water in the containers. It then calls the function `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
The function `func_1`:
1. Calculates the total amount of water and the mean amount of water per container.
2. Iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a cumulative deviation `curr` from the mean.
3. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it returns 'NO'.
4. If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it returns 'YES'.

The function summary states that `func_1` returns 'NO' if the sum of the deviations of the elements from the mean is negative at any point during the iteration. This is a crucial point to understand the logic of the function.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the sum of the amounts of water is divisible by the number of containers, but the distribution cannot be made equal by pouring water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index.

#### Example Test Case:
Consider the test case:
```
3
3
1 2 3
```
- The sum of the amounts of water is 6, which is divisible by 3.
- The mean amount of water per container is 2.

The function `func_1` will:
1. Initialize `curr` to 0.
2. Iterate through the list:
   - For `i = 0`, `nums[0] = 1`, `curr += 1 - 2 = -1`. Since `curr` is negative, the function returns 'NO'.

This example correctly identifies that it is impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the allowed operations. The function `func_1` correctly returns 'NO' for this case.

#### General Correctness:
The function `func_1` correctly checks if the cumulative deviation from the mean becomes negative at any point. If it does, it means that at some point, the total amount of water in the containers with indices less than the current index is less than the required amount to reach the mean, making it impossible to equalize the amounts using the allowed operations.

If the cumulative deviation remains non-negative throughout the iteration, it means that the total amount of water in the containers with indices less than the current index is always sufficient to reach the mean, and thus it is possible to equalize the amounts.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was incorrect. The function `func_1` correctly handles the problem by checking the cumulative deviation from the mean. If the cumulative deviation becomes negative, it correctly returns 'NO'. If it remains non-negative, it correctly returns 'YES'. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
