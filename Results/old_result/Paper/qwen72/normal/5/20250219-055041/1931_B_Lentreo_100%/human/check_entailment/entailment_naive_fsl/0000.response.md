Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the sum of the amounts of water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers, but the distribution cannot be made equal by pouring water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index. 

For example, consider the test case:
```
3
3
1 2 3
```
The sum of the amounts of water is 6, which is divisible by 3, so the mean amount of water per container is 2. However, the program will return "YES" because it does not check if the water can be poured from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index. In this case, it is impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the allowed operations (i.e., pouring from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index).

The program should return "NO" for this case, but it incorrectly returns "YES". Therefore, the program is incorrect.
