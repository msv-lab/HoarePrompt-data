### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given `n` containers with different amounts of water.
   - The sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`.
   - We can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The target amount of water in each container after equalization is `mean = total // n`.
   - To achieve equalization, we need to ensure that the cumulative difference `curr` between the water amounts and the mean does not become negative at any point during the iteration. This is because a negative `curr` indicates that we cannot pour enough water from the previous containers to the current container to reach the mean.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the mean of the water amounts.
   - It then iterates through the containers, maintaining a cumulative difference `curr` between the current container's water and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that the current container has less water than the mean, and there is not enough water from the previous containers to make up the difference without violating the `i < j` condition. Therefore, it returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it means that the water can be redistributed to achieve the mean in all containers, and it returns 'YES'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n = 1`, the problem is trivially true because there is only one container. The program handles this case correctly.
   - If all containers already have the same amount of water, the problem is also trivially true. The program handles this case correctly.
   - The program correctly handles the general case where the water amounts are different and need to be redistributed.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly calculates the mean.
   - The program correctly checks if the cumulative difference `curr` becomes negative at any point.
   - If `curr` becomes negative, it correctly returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it correctly returns 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the reasoning above. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine if the water can be redistributed to achieve the mean in all containers.

Final: **True**
