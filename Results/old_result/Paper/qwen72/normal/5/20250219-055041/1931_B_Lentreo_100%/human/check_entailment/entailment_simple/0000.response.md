### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

2. **Sum and Mean Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total amount of water in all containers using `sum(nums)`.
   - It checks if the total amount is divisible by the number of containers `n`. However, this check is redundant because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
   - It calculates the mean amount of water each container should have after equalizing using `mean = total // n`.

3. **Water Pouring Logic:**
   - The program initializes a variable `curr` to 0, which will track the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in the containers and the mean.
   - It iterates over each container and updates `curr` by adding the difference between the current container's water amount and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that the current container has less water than the mean, and there is no way to pour water from a container with less water to a container with more water to achieve the mean. Therefore, the function returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it means that it is possible to equalize the water in all containers, and the function returns 'YES'.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where there is only one container (i.e., `n = 1`). In this case, the water is already equalized, and the function will return 'YES'.
   - The program also handles cases where the water amounts are already equal, and the function will return 'YES'.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm is correct because it ensures that the cumulative difference never becomes negative, which is a necessary condition for the water to be equalized.
   - The final check of `curr` being 0 is not necessary because if the loop completes without returning 'NO', it is guaranteed that the water can be equalized.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
