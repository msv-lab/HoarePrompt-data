Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct based on the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

2. **Sum and Mean Calculation**: The program calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers `n`. Since the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, this check is redundant but does not affect the correctness. The mean amount of water per container is then calculated as `mean = total // n`.

3. **Pouring Operation Simulation**: The program simulates the pouring operation by iterating through the list of water amounts. It maintains a running sum `curr` that tracks the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the mean. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that it is not possible to balance the water amounts using the given operation (pouring from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index).

4. **Output**: If the program completes the iteration without `curr` becoming negative, it returns "YES", indicating that it is possible to balance the water amounts. Otherwise, it returns "NO".

The logic of the program aligns with the problem's requirements and constraints, ensuring that the solution is correct.
