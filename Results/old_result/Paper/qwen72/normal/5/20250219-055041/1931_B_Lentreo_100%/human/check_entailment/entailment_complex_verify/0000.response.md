### Reasoning:

The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the sum of the amounts of water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers, but the distribution cannot be made equal by pouring water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index. However, this assessment is based on a misunderstanding of the problem constraints and the logic of the program.

1. **Problem Constraints and Logic:**
   - The problem states that the sum of the amounts of water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers, and we need to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the allowed operations (pouring from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index).
   - The key insight is that the sum of the deviations from the mean must remain non-negative throughout the process. If at any point the cumulative deviation becomes negative, it means that the required amount of water to balance the containers cannot be achieved by the allowed operations.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly calculates the mean amount of water per container.
   - It then iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a cumulative deviation (`curr`).
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, the program returns "NO" because it indicates that the required amount of water to balance the containers cannot be achieved by the allowed operations.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, the program returns "YES".

3. **Example Test Case:**
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     3
     3
     1 2 3
     ```
   - The sum of the amounts of water is 6, which is divisible by 3, so the mean amount of water per container is 2.
   - The program will iterate through the list:
     - For `i = 0`: `curr += 1 - 2 = -1`. Since `curr` is negative, the program returns "NO".
   - This is the correct behavior because it is indeed impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the allowed operations.

4. **Annotated Code Validation:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at key points.
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the sum of the deviations from the mean remains non-negative throughout the iteration.
   - If `curr` becomes negative, it correctly returns "NO".
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it correctly returns "YES".

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is incorrect. The program correctly handles the case where the sum of the amounts of water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers and correctly determines if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the allowed operations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
