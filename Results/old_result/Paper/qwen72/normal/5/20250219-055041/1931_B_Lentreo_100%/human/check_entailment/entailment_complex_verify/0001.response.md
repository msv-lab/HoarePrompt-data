### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if it is possible to equalize the water amounts in `n` containers using the operation of pouring water from a container `i` to a container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The sum of the water amounts is divisible by `n`, ensuring that the target amount of water in each container is an integer.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The target amount of water in each container after equalization is `mean = total // n`.
   - To achieve equalization, the cumulative difference `curr` between the current container's water and the mean must never become negative. This is because if `curr` becomes negative, it means that the total amount of water in the first `i` containers is less than the required amount to reach the mean in the first `i` containers, and thus it is impossible to equalize the water amounts.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the mean of the water amounts.
   - It then iterates through the containers, maintaining a cumulative difference `curr` between the current container's water and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that the total amount of water in the first `i` containers is less than the required amount to reach the mean in the first `i` containers, and the function returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, the function returns 'YES'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n = 1`, the problem is trivially true because there is only one container, and the function correctly handles this case.
   - If all containers already have the same amount of water, the function correctly returns 'YES'.
   - The program correctly handles these cases.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly calculates the mean.
   - The program correctly checks if the cumulative difference `curr` becomes negative at any point.
   - If `curr` becomes negative, it correctly returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it correctly returns 'YES'.

6. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotations confirm that the program maintains the correct state throughout its execution.
   - The state before the function call is correctly described: `nums` is a list of non-negative integers where the sum of the elements is divisible by the length of the list.
   - The state within the function is also correctly described: `mean` is calculated as the integer division of the total sum by the length of the list, and `curr` is the cumulative difference between the current container's water and the mean.
   - The final state is correctly described: if `curr` is less than 0 at any point, the function returns 'NO'; otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description, the reasoning above, and the validation of the annotated code.

Final: **True**
