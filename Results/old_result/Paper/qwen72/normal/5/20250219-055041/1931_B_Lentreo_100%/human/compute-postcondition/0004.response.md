Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of non-negative integers where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, and the sum of the elements in `nums` is exactly divisible by `n` (i.e., `total % n == 0`).**
