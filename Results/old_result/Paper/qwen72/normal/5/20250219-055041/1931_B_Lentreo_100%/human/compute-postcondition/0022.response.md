The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of non-negative integers where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`. The function returns 'NO' in most cases, but returns 'YES' in a specific case. 

Given the output cases, it seems that the function is designed to check for a specific condition that is met in Case_5, leading to the return of 'YES'. However, the exact condition that leads to 'YES' is not explicitly stated in the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `nums` where the sum of the elements is divisible by the length of the list. It returns 'NO' in most cases, and 'YES' in a specific, unmentioned case.**
