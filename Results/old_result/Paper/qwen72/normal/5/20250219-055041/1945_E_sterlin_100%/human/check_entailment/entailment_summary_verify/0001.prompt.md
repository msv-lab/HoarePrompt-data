You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

- Program:
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    return int(input())

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))

#Function 4:
def func_4():
    return input()

#Function 5:
def func_5():
    return input().split()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user and returns a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by whitespace. The function does not modify any external variables or state. After the function concludes, the program has a list of strings derived from the user's input.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` that needs to be found.
   - We can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation.
   - After rearranging, we perform a binary search to find `x`.
   - The goal is to ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.

2. **Binary Search on a Permutation:**
   - Binary search works on sorted arrays. However, in this problem, we are applying it to a permutation.
   - The binary search algorithm in the problem is slightly different from the standard binary search:
     - It initializes `l` to 1 and `r` to `n + 1`.
     - It continues until `r - l = 1`.
     - It calculates the middle index `m` as `m = (r + l) // 2`.
     - If `p_m <= x`, it updates `l` to `m`, otherwise it updates `r` to `m`.

3. **Swapping Elements:**
   - The key to solving this problem is to ensure that the binary search can still find `x` even though the array is not sorted.
   - We need to place `x` in a position where the binary search will eventually find it.
   - The binary search will always end with `l` being the index where `x` should be if the array were sorted.

4. **Algorithm to Solve the Problem:**
   - For each test case, we need to find the position of `x` in the permutation.
   - We then need to ensure that `x` is in a position that will be found by the binary search.
   - If `x` is already in the correct position, no swaps are needed.
   - If `x` is not in the correct position, we can swap it into the correct position using at most 2 swaps.

5. **Correctness of the Provided Program:**
   - The provided program defines several functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) to read input.
   - However, the program does not contain any logic to solve the problem. It only reads input and does not perform any swaps or binary search.
   - Therefore, the program is incomplete and does not solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. It only reads input and does not perform the necessary swaps or binary search to find the number `x` in the permutation.
