Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as the initial length of the list, `result` is the final result after applying `func_1` to all elements of `numbers` in sequence.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `numbers` remains unchanged, and the variable `result` holds the value obtained by applying the function `func_1` to the initial value of `result` (which was the first element of `numbers`) and each subsequent element of `numbers` in order. The final value of `result` is the cumulative result of all these function applications.
