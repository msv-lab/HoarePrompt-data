The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of integers, and the list is non-empty. The function returns the final result after applying `func_1` to all elements of the list `numbers` in sequence. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a non-empty list of integers `numbers` and return the result of applying `func_1` to each element in the list in sequence.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty list of integers `numbers` and returns the result of applying `func_1` to each element in the list in sequence.**
