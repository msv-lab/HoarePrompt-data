The only objects in the loop head are the list `numbers` and the variable `num`. For the loop to execute, `numbers[1:]` must be non-empty, meaning `numbers` must have at least 2 elements. The state of `result` is not relevant to the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted.

Given that `numbers` is already non-empty, to ensure the loop executes, `numbers` must have at least 2 elements. The variable `num` will be the second element of `numbers` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of `numbers`, `result` is equal to the first element of `numbers`**
