Output State: **`cnt` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 2, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least two elements, `ans` is 0, `x` is the second element of `a`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of the key `x` in the dictionary `cnt` by incrementing it by 1. Initially, `cnt[x]` was 1, so after the execution, it becomes 2. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `ans`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
