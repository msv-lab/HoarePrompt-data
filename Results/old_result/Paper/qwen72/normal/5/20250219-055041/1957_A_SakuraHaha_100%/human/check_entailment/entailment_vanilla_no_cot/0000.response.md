Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The issue lies in the line where it calculates the number of polygons that can be formed:

```python
ans += x // 3
```

This line assumes that any group of sticks of the same length can form a polygon with 3 sides (a triangle), which is not always the case. The problem requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons (which can have any number of sides, not just 3) that can be formed. A regular polygon can have 3, 4, 5, or more sides, and the program should consider the possibility of forming polygons with more than 3 sides.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate over the possible number of sides for a regular polygon (from 3 to the maximum possible number of sides, which is `n` in the worst case) and determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed for each side length.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        for sides in range(3, n + 1):
            ans += x // sides
    print(ans)
```

However, this version is still not optimal because it does not account for the fact that forming a polygon with more sides might leave fewer sticks available for forming other polygons. A more efficient approach would be to use the maximum number of sides that can be formed with the available sticks, which is the minimum of `x // 3` and `x // 4` (for squares and higher-sided polygons).

Here is a more optimized version:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)
```

This version is correct for the given examples, but it still assumes that the maximum number of polygons is formed by triangles. To be fully correct, the program should consider the possibility of forming polygons with more than 3 sides, and it should prioritize forming polygons with more sides when it is beneficial to do so. 

A more complete solution would involve a more complex algorithm to maximize the number of polygons formed, considering all possible side lengths. However, for the given examples, the program would still produce incorrect results for cases where forming polygons with more than 3 sides is optimal.
