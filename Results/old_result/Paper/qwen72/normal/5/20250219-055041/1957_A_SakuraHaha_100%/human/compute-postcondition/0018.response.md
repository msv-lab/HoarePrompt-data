Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`cnt`**: This is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a`, and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
2. **`t`**: This is an integer with a value between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
3. **`a`**: This is a list of integers input by the user.
4. **`n`**: This is an input integer.
5. **`ans`**: This is the sum of the integer division of each value in `cnt` by 3.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`cnt` Dictionary Construction**:
   - The dictionary `cnt` is constructed by iterating over the list `a` and counting the occurrences of each integer.
   - For example, if `a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]`, then `cnt` would be `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4}`.

2. **Integer Division by 3**:
   - For each value in the dictionary `cnt`, we perform an integer division by 3.
   - Integer division by 3 means we take the floor of the division result.
   - For example, if `cnt = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4}`, then the integer divisions would be:
     - `1 // 3 = 0`
     - `2 // 3 = 0`
     - `3 // 3 = 1`
     - `4 // 3 = 1`

3. **Sum of Integer Divisions**:
   - We sum the results of these integer divisions to get `ans`.
   - Using the example above, `ans = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2`.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the sum of the integer divisions of each value in the `cnt` dictionary by 3. Since the exact values of `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the integer divisions of each value in the `cnt` dictionary by 3)**
