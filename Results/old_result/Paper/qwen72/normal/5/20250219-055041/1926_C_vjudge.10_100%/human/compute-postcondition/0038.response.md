Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i` inclusive for all `i` from 1 to `inf - 1`, `i` is `inf`, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of `inf - 1`, `x` is the last digit of `inf - 1`, `value` is an input integer, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`.**

The code snippet `value = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `value`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions for `t` and `_` are still valid. The specific value of `value` is provided by the input.
