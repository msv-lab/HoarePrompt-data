To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `i`. The loop will iterate over each character in the string representation of `i`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be a positive integer, and `str(i)` must be a non-empty string. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `t + 1`
- `x` is the last digit of `t`

We need to adjust the state to ensure that `i` is a positive integer and `str(i)` is non-empty. Since `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` will always be a positive integer (because `t + 1` is at least 2). Therefore, `str(i)` will always be a non-empty string.

However, `x` is currently defined as the last digit of `t`, but in the loop head, `x` is used to iterate over the characters of `str(i)`. So, we need to adjust `x` to be the first character of `str(i)` before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros with `values[i]` now equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`, `i` is `t + 1`, `x` is the first character of `str(i)`, `sum_value_digits` is 0**
