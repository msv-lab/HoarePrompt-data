Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 integers, `i` is `inf`, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of `inf - 1`, `x` is the last digit of `inf - 1`, `value` is an input integer, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`**

Explanation:
- `value` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `inf`, `values`, `i`, `sum_value_digits`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The value of `_` is incremented by 1 but still must be less than `t`.
