Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros.** 

The list `values` has been initialized to contain 200001 elements, all of which are zeros. The values of `t`, `n`, and `inf` remain unchanged.
