To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for x in str(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `x`, which will take the value of the next character in `str(i)`.

Let's break down the current state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case.
- `inf` is 200001.
- `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, with `values[i]` now equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`.
- `i` is `t + 1`.
- `x` is the first character of `str(i)`.
- `sum_value_digits` is the integer value of the first digit of `str(t + 1)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be the next character in `str(i)`. Since `x` is the first character of `str(i)` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `x` should be the second character of `str(i)`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros with `values[i]` now equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`, `i` is `t + 1`, `x` is the second character of `str(i)`, `sum_value_digits` is the integer value of the first digit of `str(t + 1)`**
