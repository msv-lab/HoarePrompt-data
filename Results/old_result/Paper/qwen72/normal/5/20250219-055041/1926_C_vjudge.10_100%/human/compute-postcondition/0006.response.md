Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is 1, `sum_value_digits` is 1, `x` is '1'.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is the first character of the string representation of `i`, which is '1'. The value of `sum_value_digits` is incremented by the integer value of `x`, which is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
