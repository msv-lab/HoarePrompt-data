The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `inf`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `inf` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to, but does not include, `inf`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` should start at 1, and `inf` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is 1**
