Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i` inclusive for all `i` from 1 to `inf - 1`, `i` is `inf`, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of `inf - 1`, `x` is the last digit of `inf - 1`, `_` is `t - 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `inf`, `values`, `i`, `sum_value_digits`, and `x` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
- The loop variable `_` is incremented by 1 with each iteration of the loop. After `t` iterations, `_` will have the value `t - 1`, since the loop starts with `_` at 0 and increments it until it reaches `t - 1`.
- The variable `value` is set to an input integer during each iteration of the loop, but it is not retained between iterations. Therefore, after the loop completes, the value of `value` is not defined in the final state.
- The loop prints the value of `values[value]` for each input `value`, but this does not affect the state of the variables in the loop.
