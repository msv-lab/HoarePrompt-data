To determine what will be printed by the `print(values[value])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`t`**: An input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases.
2. **`n`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) for each test case. This is not directly used in the print statement but is part of the precondition.
3. **`inf`**: A constant integer set to 200001.
4. **`values`**: A list of 200001 integers. Each element `values[i]` is the sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i` inclusive for all `i` from 1 to `inf - 1` (i.e., 200000).
5. **`i`**: Set to `inf`, which is 200001.
6. **`sum_value_digits`**: The sum of the digits of `inf - 1`, which is 200000. The sum of the digits of 200000 is \(2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2\).
7. **`x`**: The last digit of `inf - 1`, which is 0.
8. **`value`**: An input integer. The exact value of `value` is not specified in the precondition, but it is an integer that is provided as part of the input.
9. **`_`**: A variable that is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`. This is not directly used in the print statement but is part of the loop or test case handling.

Now, let's focus on the `print(values[value])` statement:

- **`value`**: This is an input integer provided for each test case. The exact value of `value` is not specified, but it is within the range of the `values` list (0 to 200000).
- **`values[value]`**: This is the element in the `values` list at the index `value`. According to the precondition, `values[i]` is the sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i` inclusive.

Since the exact value of `value` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the value of `value` and the structure of the `values` list.

Output: **values[value] (where values[value] is the sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to value inclusive)**
