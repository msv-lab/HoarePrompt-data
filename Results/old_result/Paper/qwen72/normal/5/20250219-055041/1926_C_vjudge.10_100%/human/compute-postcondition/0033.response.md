Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i` inclusive for all `i` from 1 to `inf - 1`, `i` is `inf`, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of `inf - 1`, `x` is the last digit of `inf - 1`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an input integer within the specified range.
- The variable `n` remains an integer within the specified range for each test case.
- The variable `inf` remains 200001.
- The list `values` is now populated such that each element `values[i]` (for `i` from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i` inclusive.
- The loop counter `i` has reached the value `inf` (200001).
- The variable `sum_value_digits` holds the sum of the digits of the number `inf - 1` (200000).
- The variable `x` holds the last digit of the number `inf - 1` (which is 0).
