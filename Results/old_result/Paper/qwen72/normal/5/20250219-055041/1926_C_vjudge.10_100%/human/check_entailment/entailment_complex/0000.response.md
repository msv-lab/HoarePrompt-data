Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem efficiently by precomputing the sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to \(2 \cdot 10^5\) and storing these sums in a list `values`. This precomputation allows the program to quickly answer each test case by simply looking up the precomputed value.

1. **Precomputation Step**:
   - The program initializes a list `values` of size \(2 \cdot 10^5 + 1\) with all elements set to 0.
   - It then iterates through each integer from 1 to \(2 \cdot 10^5\), calculates the sum of the digits of each integer, and updates the `values` list.
   - The sum of the digits of an integer `i` is calculated by converting `i` to a string and summing the integer values of its characters.
   - The value `values[i]` is set to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`, which effectively accumulates the sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`.

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the precomputed value `values[n]`.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step runs in \(O(2 \cdot 10^5)\) time, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - Each test case is processed in \(O(1)\) time by a simple list lookup, making the overall time complexity \(O(2 \cdot 10^5 + t)\), which is well within the 0.5 seconds time limit for \(t \leq 10^4\).

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly calculates the sum of the sums of the digits for each integer from 1 to \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - It correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - The final output for each test case is the correct sum of the sums of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
