Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros with `values[t + 1]` now equal to `values[t] + the sum of the digits of `t + 1`, `i` is `t + 2`, `sum_value_digits` is the first digit of `i`, `values[i]` is now equal to `values[i - 1] + the sum of the digits of `t + 1`.**

Explanation:
- `sum_value_digits` is incremented by the integer value of `x`, which is the first digit of `i`.
- The value of `x` is the first digit of `i`, and `i` is `t + 2`.
- `sum_value_digits` is now equal to the first digit of `i`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
