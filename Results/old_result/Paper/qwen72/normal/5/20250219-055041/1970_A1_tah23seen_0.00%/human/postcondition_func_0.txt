The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty, balanced parentheses string `s` and returns a new string `ans` that rearranges the characters of `s` based on the depth of the parentheses. The characters are ordered such that those at the same depth are grouped together and the groups are ordered from the shallowest to the deepest depth. The final state of the program is that `s` remains unchanged, `n` is the length of `s`, `d` is a dictionary that maps indices to their corresponding depth, and `ans` is the rearranged string.
