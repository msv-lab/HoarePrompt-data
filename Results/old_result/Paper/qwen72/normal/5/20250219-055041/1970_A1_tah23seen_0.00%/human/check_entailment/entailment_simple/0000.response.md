### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input string `n` and immediately calls `func_1(n)`.
   - The input string `n` is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.

2. **Dictionary Initialization:**
   - The dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0`, which correctly represents the balance before the first character of the string.
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` and updates the balance in the dictionary `d` based on whether the character is an opening or closing parenthesis.

3. **Balance Calculation:**
   - The balance is correctly computed by incrementing the balance for an opening parenthesis `(` and decrementing it for a closing parenthesis `)`.
   - The balance is stored in the dictionary `d` with the key being the position (index + 1) of the character in the string.

4. **Dictionary Processing:**
   - The last element in the dictionary `d` (which corresponds to the balance after the entire string) is removed using `d.pop(n)`. This is correct because the balance after the entire string should be 0, and it is not needed for the sorting step.
   - The dictionary `d` is then sorted by the balance values in ascending order, and in case of ties, by the positions in descending order. This is achieved using `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])`.

5. **Building the Result:**
   - The sorted dictionary items are used to build the result string `ans` by appending the characters from `s` at the positions specified by the keys in the sorted dictionary.
   - The final result `ans` is returned.

6. **Output:**
   - The program correctly returns the balanced shuffle of the input string `s`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem. It computes the balance for each prefix, sorts the characters based on the balance and position, and constructs the shuffled string accordingly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
