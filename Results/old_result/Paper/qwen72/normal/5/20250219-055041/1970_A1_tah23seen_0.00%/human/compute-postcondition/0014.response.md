The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the string `s`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `s` must still be a non-empty string with a length greater than 2.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with `d[0] = 0`, `d[1]` is set to 1 if `s[0]` is '(', or -1 if `s[0]` is ')'; `d[2]` is set to `d[1] + 1` if `s[1]` is '(', or `d[1] - 1` if `s[1]` is ')'; `i` is 2.**
