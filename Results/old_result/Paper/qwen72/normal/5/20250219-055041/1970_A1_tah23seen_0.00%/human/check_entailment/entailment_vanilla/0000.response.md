Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the input string `n` and immediately calls `func_1(n)`, which is the main function that processes the string.

2. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a dictionary `d` to store the balance of the prefix at each position.
   - It sets `d[0] = 0` to initialize the balance before the first character.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and updates the balance in the dictionary `d` based on whether the current character is an opening parenthesis `(` or a closing parenthesis `)`.
   - The balance is correctly calculated as the number of opening parentheses minus the number of closing parentheses up to the current position.

3. **Removing the Last Element**:
   - The program removes the last element from the dictionary `d` using `d.pop(n)`. This is necessary because the balance at the end of the string (position `n`) is not needed for the sorting step.

4. **Sorting the Dictionary**:
   - The program sorts the dictionary `d` based on the balance values in increasing order. If two positions have the same balance, it sorts them in decreasing order of position.
   - The sorting is done using `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])`, which sorts the items by the balance value.

5. **Constructing the Result**:
   - The program initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result.
   - It iterates through the sorted items and appends the corresponding character from the input string `s` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the constructed string `ans`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)`.

**Issues**:
- The sorting step is incorrect. The problem specifies that in case of a tie in the balance, the positions should be sorted in decreasing order. However, the current sorting step `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])` does not handle this correctly. It sorts by balance in increasing order but does not break ties by position in decreasing order.

**Corrected Sorting**:
- To correctly handle the tie-breaking, the sorting key should be a tuple where the first element is the balance and the second element is the negative of the position. This can be achieved by changing the sorting key to `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect due to the incorrect sorting step.

Correctness: **False**
