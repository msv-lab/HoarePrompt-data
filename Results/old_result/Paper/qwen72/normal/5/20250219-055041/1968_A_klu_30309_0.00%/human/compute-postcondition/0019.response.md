Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `max_val` is the largest integer `y` such that 2 <= y < x and `x % y == 0`, and `y` is 2. If no such `y` exists, `max_val` remains 1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `x` remains unchanged as an integer between 2 and 1000. The variable `max_val` will be the largest integer `y` that is less than `x` and divides `x` evenly (i.e., `x % y == 0`). If no such `y` exists, `max_val` will remain 1. The loop variable `y` will be 2, as the loop iterates from `x - 1` down to 2.
