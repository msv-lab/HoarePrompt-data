The only objects in the loop head are variables `y`, `x`, and the range parameters, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `x - 1` and `1` with a step of `-1`. For the loop to execute, the starting value of the range (`x - 1`) must be greater than the ending value (`1`), and the step must be negative, which is already the case.

Given that `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `x - 1` will be at least 1 and at most 999. This means that `x - 1` will always be greater than `1`, ensuring that the loop will execute at least once.

However, the state of `y` needs to be adjusted to reflect the starting value of the loop, which is `x - 1`.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `max_val` is 1, `y` is `x - 1`**
