The only objects in the loop head are variables `y` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `y` relative to `x`. The loop iterates from `x - 1` down to 2. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `x - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1, making it `x - 2`, and it must still be greater than 1.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `max_val` is 1, and `y` is `x - 2`. If `x` is divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`), then `max_val` is updated to `x - 2` and 2 * y is less than x. Otherwise, `max_val` remains 1.**
