Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Conditions**:
   - It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair.
   - It checks if `a == b == c` to determine if all digits are the same, in which case it prints "NONE".
   - It checks if `b` is the maximum of the three digits to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is correct because if `b` is the maximum, then either `a < b > c` or `a > b > c` (but the latter is not possible since `a` and `c` would be the same or greater than `b`).

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, it prints "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if they form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise.

The program handles all the specified conditions and outputs the correct results for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
