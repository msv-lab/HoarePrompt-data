Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a < b < c`, then this relationship holds. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, then they are equal to each other. If they are not all equal, then the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is either `a` or `c`, but not `b`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the new input integers provided by the user.
- The relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` (whether `a < b < c` or not) and the condition regarding their equality or the maximum value (if not all equal) are still valid based on the new input values.
- The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
