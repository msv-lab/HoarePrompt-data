Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
