### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` and converts them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Stair Condition:**
   - The program checks if the digits form a stair using the condition `a < b < c`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - This is correct according to the problem description.

3. **Equal Digits Condition:**
   - The program checks if all three digits are equal using the condition `a == b == c`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints "NONE".
   - This is correct because if all digits are equal, they do not form a stair or a peak.

4. **Peak Condition:**
   - The program checks if the digits form a peak using the condition `max(a, b, c) == b`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - This is correct because a peak is defined by the condition `a < b > c`, and if `b` is the maximum of the three digits, it implies that `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.

5. **None Condition:**
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "NONE".
   - This is correct because if the digits do not form a stair or a peak, they must be "NONE".

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem description. It reads the input correctly, checks the conditions for a stair, peak, and none, and prints the appropriate output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
