Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
   - It is not the case that `a < b < c`.
   - Additionally, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all equal.
   - The current value of `b` is the maximum among `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('PEAK')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'PEAK'`.
   - The initial state provides conditions about the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these conditions do not affect the execution of the `print` statement.
   - The fact that `b` is the maximum among `a`, `b`, and `c` and that `a < b < c` is not true, along with the condition that `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all equal, implies that `b` is a peak value in the context of the problem.
   - However, the `print` statement does not use any of these variables or their values. It only prints the string `'PEAK'`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'PEAK'`.

Output: **PEAK**
