### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` and converts them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Stair Condition:**
   - The program checks if the digits form a stair using the condition `a < b < c`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - This is correct according to the problem description.

3. **Equal Digits Condition:**
   - The program checks if all three digits are equal using the condition `a == b == c`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints "NONE".
   - This is correct because if all digits are equal, they do not form a stair or a peak.

4. **Peak Condition:**
   - The program checks if the digits form a peak using the condition `max(a, b, c) == b`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - This condition is not entirely correct. The condition `max(a, b, c) == b` only ensures that `b` is the maximum of the three digits, but it does not ensure that `a < b > c`. For example, if `a = 5`, `b = 5`, and `c = 3`, the program will incorrectly print "PEAK" when it should print "NONE".

5. **None Condition:**
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "NONE".
   - This is correct because if the digits do not form a stair or a peak, they must be "NONE".

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the stair and equal digits conditions. However, the peak condition is not correctly implemented. The condition `max(a, b, c) == b` is insufficient to determine a peak, as it does not check the relative order of `a` and `c` with respect to `b`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
