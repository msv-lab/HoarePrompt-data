Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements equal to 0 except `q[w[0]]` which is now 1, `j` is 0**

The value of `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
