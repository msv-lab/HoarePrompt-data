The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where the value at index `w[0]` is now 1, `j` is 1**
