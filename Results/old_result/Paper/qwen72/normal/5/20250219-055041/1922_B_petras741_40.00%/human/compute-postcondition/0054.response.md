Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where the value at each index `w[j]` (for `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `eta` is a list containing the indices of `q` where the value is greater than 0, and `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is the value of `q` at the index `eta[0]`. Otherwise, `rho` is the sum of the values of `q` at the indices `eta[0]` to `eta[eta_ln - 1]`, and `res` is the sum of the values of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` for each `j` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1` plus the sum of the values of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for each `j` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`. If `eta_ln` is greater than 1001, the loop breaks after the 1000th iteration.***
