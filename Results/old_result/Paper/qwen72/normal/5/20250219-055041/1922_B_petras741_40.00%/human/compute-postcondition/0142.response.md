Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, `res` is equal to `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is calculated using the formula `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`.
- All other variables (`n`, `j`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
