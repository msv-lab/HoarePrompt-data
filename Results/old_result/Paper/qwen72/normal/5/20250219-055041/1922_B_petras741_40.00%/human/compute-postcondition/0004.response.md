The code snippet `w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple parts based on whitespace, converts each part to an integer, and stores the result in the list `w`. The initial state variables `t`, `i`, and `buffer` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
