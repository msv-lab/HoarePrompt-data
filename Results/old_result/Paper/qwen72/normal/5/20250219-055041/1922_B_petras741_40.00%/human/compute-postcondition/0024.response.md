Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where the value at each index `w[j]` (for `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, `eta` is a list containing the integer 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` (which is 2) to the list `eta`.
- Since `j` is 2, `eta` now contains the integer 2.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `buffer`, `n`, `w`, and `q` remain unchanged.
- The condition `q[j] > 0` is still valid, so `eta` contains the integer 1, and now it also contains the integer 2.
