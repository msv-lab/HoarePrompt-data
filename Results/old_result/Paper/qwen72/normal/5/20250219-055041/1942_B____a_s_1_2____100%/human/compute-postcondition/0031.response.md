Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `mex` is the minimum value of the list `p`, `i` is `-1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is only used to define the range of the loop.
- The list `a` remains unchanged as it is only read within the loop.
- The list `p` is now fully populated. Each element `p[i]` (for `i` from `0` to `n-1`) is set to `mex - a[i]` where `mex` is updated at each iteration to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the value `p[i]`.
- The variable `mex` is updated to be the minimum value of the list `p` after all iterations.
- The variable `i` is `-1` after the loop finishes, as the loop iterates from `n-1` down to `0`, and the final value of `i` is `-1` (one step before `0` in the range).
