Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1, `mex` is equal to `n`.**

The variable `mex` is assigned the value of `n`, which is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
