Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
3. `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
4. `p` is a list of length `n` where each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
5. `mex` is the minimum value of the list `p`.
6. `i` is `-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*p)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input and List `a`**:
   - `t` and `n` are input integers.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user. The length of `a` is `n`.

2. **List `p` Calculation**:
   - `p` is a list of length `n`.
   - Each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - To determine `p[i]`, we need to know the value of `mex`.

3. **Minimum Value `mex`**:
   - `mex` is defined as the minimum value of the list `p`.
   - However, `p` is defined in terms of `mex`, which creates a circular dependency. This suggests that `mex` must be determined before `p` is fully constructed.

4. **Circular Dependency Resolution**:
   - The `mex` value is typically the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `a`.
   - Once `mex` is determined, we can calculate each `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.

5. **List `p` Construction**:
   - After determining `mex`, we construct `p` by subtracting each element of `a` from `mex`.
   - For example, if `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `mex = 0`, then `p = [0 - 1, 0 - 2, 0 - 3] = [-1, -2, -3]`.

6. **Printing `p`**:
   - The `print(*p)` statement will print all elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the circular dependency, the output will be the elements of the list `p` where each element is calculated as `mex - a[i]`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `mex` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of the given information.

Output: **[mex - a[0], mex - a[1], ..., mex - a[n-1]] (where `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `a` and `a` is the list of integers input by the user)**
