Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `mex` is the minimum value of the list `p`, `i` is `-1`, and the loop will execute one more time if `t` is greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `a` to be a list of integers input by the user.
- The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `p`, `mex`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The condition for the loop to execute one more time if `t` is greater than 0 remains unchanged.
- The new value of `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, which replaces the previous value of `a` (if any).
