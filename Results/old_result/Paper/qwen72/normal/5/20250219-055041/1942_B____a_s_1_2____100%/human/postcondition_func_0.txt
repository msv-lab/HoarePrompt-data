The function reads an integer `t` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the user. It then computes a list `p` of length `n` where each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]` for `i` ranging from `n-1` to `0`, with `mex` initially set to `n` and updated to the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]` during each iteration. Finally, it prints the elements of `p` for each test case. The function does not return any value.
