To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop is iterating in reverse order, starting from `n - 1` down to `0`.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user
- `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1 except for `p[n-1]` which is `mex - a[n-1]`
- `mex` is equal to `min(n, mex - a[n-1])`
- `i` is `n - 1`

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be `n - 2`.
4. **Loop Boundaries**: The loop starts at `n - 1` and goes down to `0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `i` must be at least `0`).

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `n` must be greater than 1 (to ensure `i` is still within the valid range for the loop to execute)

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1 except for `p[n-1]` which is `mex - a[n-1]`, `mex` is equal to `min(n, mex - a[n-1])`, `i` is `n - 2`**
