The loop head involves the variable `i` and the range defined by `n - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop variable `i` changes and whether the loop condition still holds.

- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 2`.
- The loop decrements `i` by 1 at each step.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

Given this, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `n - 3` (since it is decremented by 1).
- The loop will execute again if `i` is still greater than or equal to 0, which means `n - 3` must be greater than or equal to 0, or equivalently, `n` must be greater than 3.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `p`, `mex`) are not directly modified by the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1` except `p[n-1]` which is `mex - a[n-1]` and `p[i]` which is `mex - a[i]`, `mex` is `min(n, mex - a[n-1], p[i])`, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` must be greater than 3**
