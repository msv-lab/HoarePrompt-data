Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the array `a` of length `n`.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes the permutation `p` as a list of `-1` values, which is a good starting point since we need to fill in the values of `p` based on the given `a`.

3. **MEX Calculation and Permutation Construction**:
   - The program starts with `mex` set to `n`. This is a reasonable initial value because the MEX of a permutation of length `n` can be at most `n` (if all integers from `0` to `n-1` are present).
   - The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive). This is correct because we need to construct the permutation `p` in reverse order to ensure that the MEX calculation is consistent with the given `a`.
   - Inside the loop, the program sets `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`. This is based on the relationship given in the problem: `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. By rearranging, we get `p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i`.
   - The program then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`. This is correct because the MEX of the array `p` up to index `i` should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in `p[0:i+1]`.

4. **Output**: After constructing the permutation `p`, the program prints the elements of `p` for each test case. This is the correct output format as specified in the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` is `1` correctly. For `n = 1`, the only possible permutation is `[0]`, and the program will correctly set `p[0]` to `mex - a[0]`, which will be `0` if `a[0]` is `1`.

6. **Consistency with Example**:
   - For the first test case, `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`, the program constructs `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which is a valid permutation.
   - For the second test case, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the program constructs `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, which is a valid permutation.
   - For the third test case, `a = [-2, 1, 2]`, the program constructs `p = [2, 0, 1]`, which is a valid permutation.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly construct a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
