The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. Here, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the problem statement. However, given the context, it can be inferred that the function likely returns some form of result or permutation based on the input list `a` and the constraints on `t` and `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The function returns a result based on these parameters, ensuring that there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data.**
