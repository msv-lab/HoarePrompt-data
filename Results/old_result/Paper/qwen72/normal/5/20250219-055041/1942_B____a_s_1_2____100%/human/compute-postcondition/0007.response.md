Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1 except for `p[n-1]` which is `mex - a[n-1]`, `mex` is equal to `n`, `i` is `n - 1`**

Explanation:
- The code `p[i] = mex - a[i]` updates the last element of the list `p` (at index `i`, which is `n - 1`) to the value `mex - a[n-1]`.
- Since `mex` is equal to `n`, the value of `p[n-1]` becomes `n - a[n-1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
