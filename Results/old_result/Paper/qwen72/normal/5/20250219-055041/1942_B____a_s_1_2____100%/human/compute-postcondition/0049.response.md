Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` for `i` from `n-1` to `0`, `mex` is the minimum value of the list `[mex, p[0], p[1], ..., p[n-1]]`, and `i` is `-1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the following conditions hold true:

- The variable `t` is an input integer that has been decremented by the number of iterations executed, but it still satisfies the condition 0 < t ≤ 10^4.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an input integer that represents the length of the list `a`, and it still satisfies the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user for each test case, and its elements still satisfy the condition -n ≤ a_i ≤ n.
- `p` is a list of length `n` that is computed for each test case. Each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]` for `i` ranging from `n-1` to `0`.
- `mex` is the minimum value of the list `[mex, p[0], p[1], ..., p[n-1]]`, which means it is updated to be the smallest value in the list `p` after each iteration of the inner loop.
- The variable `i` is `-1` at the end of each iteration of the inner loop, indicating that the loop has processed all elements of the list `a` in reverse order.

This output state reflects the final condition of the variables after the loop has completed all `t` iterations.
