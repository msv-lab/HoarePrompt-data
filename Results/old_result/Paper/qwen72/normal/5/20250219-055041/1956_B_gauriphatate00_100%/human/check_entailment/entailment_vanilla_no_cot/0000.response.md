Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly account for the optimal play strategy of Nene. The function `func_1` simply counts the number of pairs (cards with the same number) in your hand and assumes that you can always score a point for each pair. However, this does not consider Nene's optimal play, which involves her trying to maximize her score and minimize yours.

For example, in the first test case with the input:
```
4
1 1 2 3
```
The solution provided will output `1`, which is correct. However, in the second test case with the input:
```
8
7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5
```
The solution will output `2`, which is also correct, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where Nene can play optimally to prevent you from scoring more points.

A correct solution would need to consider the following:
1. Count the number of pairs in your hand.
2. For each pair in your hand, check if Nene has the same pair. If she does, she will play it after you to maximize her score and minimize yours.
3. Calculate the maximum score you can achieve by playing optimally, taking into account Nene's optimal responses.

The current solution does not implement this logic, so it is incorrect.
