The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `a`. For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. The state of `count_a` is not in the loop head, so it cannot be adjusted.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- Each integer `a_i` in `a` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`.
- Each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times.
- `count_a` is an empty dictionary.

To ensure the loop can execute, `a` must have at least one element. The variable `num` will take the value of the first element in the list `a`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) and must have at least one element, `num` is the first element in the list `a`, `count_a` is an empty dictionary**
