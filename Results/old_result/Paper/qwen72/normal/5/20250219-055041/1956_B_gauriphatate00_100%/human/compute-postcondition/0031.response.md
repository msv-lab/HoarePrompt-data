Output State: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a`, and the value associated with each key is the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`. `max_score` is the number of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly twice in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each integer `num` from 1 to `n`.
- For each `num`, it checks if `num` is a key in the dictionary `count_a`.
- If `num` is a key and `count_a[num]` is 2, it increments `max_score` by 1.
- After all iterations, `max_score` will contain the count of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly twice in the list `a`.
- The list `a` and the dictionary `count_a` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
