To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5).
- `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a`, and the value associated with each key is the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `num` is 1.
- If `num` is a key in the dictionary `count_a` and `count_a[num]` is 2, then `max_score` is 1. Otherwise, `max_score` remains 0.

The loop statement is:
```
for num in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `num` is within the range `1` to `n` (inclusive).
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be incremented by 1, making `num` equal to 2.
4. **Range Check**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `num` is less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again if `n` is at least 2.

### Adjusted State:
- `num` is incremented to 2.
- `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables (`a`, `count_a`, `max_score`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a`, and the value associated with each key is the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`. `n` must be at least 2, `num` is 2. If `num` is a key in the dictionary `count_a` and `count_a[num]` is 2, then `max_score` is 1. Otherwise, `max_score` remains 0.**
