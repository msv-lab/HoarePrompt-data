The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `n`. `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, and each integer `a_i` in `a` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ n`. Each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times. The function returns the number of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly twice in the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns the count of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly twice in the list `a`.**
