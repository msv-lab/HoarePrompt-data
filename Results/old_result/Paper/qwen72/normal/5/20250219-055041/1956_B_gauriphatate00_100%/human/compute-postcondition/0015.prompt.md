Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and each integer `a_i` in `a` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`. Each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times. `count_a` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    if num in count_a:
        count_a[num] += 1
    else:
        count_a[num] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) and must have at least one element, `num` is the first element in the list `a`, `count_a` is a dictionary. If `num` is already a key in `count_a`, the value of `count_a[num]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is added as a key in `count_a` with the value 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) and must have at least two elements, `num` is the second element in the list `a`, `count_a` is a dictionary with the first element of `a` as a key and its value increased by 1. If `num` is in `count_a`, the value of `count_a[num]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count_a[num]` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) and must have at least three elements. `num` is the third element in the list `a`. `count_a` is a dictionary with the first element of `a` as a key and its value increased by 1. If `num` is in `count_a`, the value of `num` in `count_a` is increased by 2. Otherwise, the value of `num` in `count_a` is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
