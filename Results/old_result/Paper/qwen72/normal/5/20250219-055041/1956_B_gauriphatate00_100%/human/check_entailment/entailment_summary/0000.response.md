Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get in a card game where you and Nene take turns placing cards on the table. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The key to solving this problem is understanding that you can only score points if you have a pair of the same card and Nene has not already placed the matching card on the table.

The function `func_1` in the provided program counts the number of unique integers in your hand that appear exactly twice. This is a good approach because:

1. **Scoring Points**: You can only score a point if you have a pair of the same card and Nene has not already placed the matching card on the table. If you have a card that appears exactly twice, you can place one card and score a point when you place the second card, assuming Nene has not already placed the matching card.

2. **Nene's Optimal Play**: Nene will always place the card that maximizes her score and minimizes yours. Therefore, if you have a pair of a card, Nene will place the matching card as soon as possible to prevent you from scoring. However, if you have a pair, you can still score one point for that card.

3. **No Modification of Input**: The function does not modify the input list `a` or the integer `n`, which is correct as the problem does not require any modifications to the input.

4. **Efficiency**: The function uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each card in your hand, which is an efficient way to determine the number of pairs.

Given the above reasoning, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get by counting the number of unique integers in your hand that appear exactly twice.

Correctness: **True**
