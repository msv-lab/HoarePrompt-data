Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the game dynamics as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not account for the optimal play strategy of Nene, who always tries to maximize her score and minimize yours. The function `func_1` only counts the number of pairs of cards you have, which is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of points you can get when Nene plays optimally.

Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

In this case, the program returns 2 because it counts the number of pairs of cards you have (1 pair of 1s and 1 pair of 2s), but the correct answer should be 1. This is because Nene will play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The optimal play would be:

1. You play 1, table: [1], score: 0
2. Nene plays 2, table: [1, 2], score: 0
3. You play 1, table: [1, 1, 2], score: 1
4. Nene plays 2, table: [1, 1, 2, 2], score: 1
5. You play 3, table: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3], score: 1
6. Nene plays 3, table: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3], score: 2

At the end of the game, you score 1 point, and Nene scores 2 points. The program's output of 2 is incorrect because it does not consider Nene's optimal play.
