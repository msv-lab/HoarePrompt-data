Output State: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each integer `a_i` in `a` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`. Each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times. `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a`, and the value associated with each key is the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`. `max_score` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `max_score` is initialized to 0.
- All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
