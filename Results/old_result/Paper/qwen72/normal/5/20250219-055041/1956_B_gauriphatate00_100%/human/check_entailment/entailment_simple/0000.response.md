### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, you and Nene, each receiving `n` cards from a deck of `2n` cards.
   - Each integer from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice in the deck.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To maximize your score, you should play cards that have a pair in your hand, because Nene will play her cards in a way that maximizes her score and minimizes yours.
   - Nene will always play a card that matches a card on the table if she has one, to score a point. If she doesn't have a matching card, she will play a card that doesn't match any card on the table to avoid giving you a point.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.
   - The function `func_1` is called to compute the maximum score you can achieve.
   - Inside `func_1`, a dictionary `count_a` is created to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
   - The program then iterates over each integer from `1` to `n` and checks if it appears exactly twice in your hand. If it does, you can score a point by playing both cards of that integer.
   - The function returns the total number of such integers, which is the maximum score you can achieve.

4. **Validation:**
   - The program correctly counts the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand.
   - This count represents the maximum number of points you can score because Nene will always play optimally to score points and prevent you from scoring more than necessary.
   - The program handles the constraints and input format correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation. It correctly computes the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
