Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than 2, and `_` is set to `m - 3`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, and `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1. In all cases, if `i + max(p1, p2)` is equal to `n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues with the same variable values and conditions.***
