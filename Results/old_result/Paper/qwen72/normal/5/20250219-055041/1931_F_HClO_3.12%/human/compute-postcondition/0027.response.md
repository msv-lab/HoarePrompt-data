Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than 2, and `_` is set to `m - 3`. `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and the current value of `i + max(p1, p2)` is `n - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
