Postcondition: **`a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` is the index where `l1[i + p1]` first equals `a2` or -1 if no such index exists, `idx2` is the index where `l2[i + p2]` first equals `a1` or -1 if no such index exists, `p1` is 1 if `l1` contains an element equal to `a2` before `l2` contains an element equal to `a1`, otherwise `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1 if `l2` contains an element equal to `a1` before `l1` contains an element equal to `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 0, `val` is an empty list, and all inputs have been consumed. Additionally, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. If `m` is equal to 2, `_` is 0. Otherwise, `_` is 1 if `m` is 1, or `m - 2` if `m` is greater than 2. The index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
