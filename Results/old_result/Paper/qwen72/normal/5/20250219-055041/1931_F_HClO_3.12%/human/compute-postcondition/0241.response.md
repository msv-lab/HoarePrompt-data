The only objects in the loop head are the variables `a3`, `l3`, and the list `val`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `val` and the current values of `a3` and `l3`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of the form `(a3, l3)`.
- If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, then `a3` and `l3` are set to the values of the next tuple in `val`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- Otherwise, `a3` and `l3` remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `val` must have at least one more tuple to iterate over. Therefore, `val` must have at least 2 tuples. The values of `a3` and `l3` will be set to the next tuple in `val` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`val` is a list containing at least 2 tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`, `a3` and `l3` are set to the values of the next tuple in `val`**
