Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than 2, and `_` is set to `m - 3`. `i` is `n - 2` (or the last value before the loop breaks), `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or one of them is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and the other is set to the index where `l2[i + p2] == a1`. `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs for `n - 1` iterations, but it may break early if certain conditions are met.
- The variable `i` will be `n - 2` if the loop completes all iterations, or it will be the last value before the loop breaks.
- `idx1` and `idx2` will either both remain -1 if no elements in `l1` and `l2` match the conditions, or they will both be set to the same index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`. Alternatively, one of them will be set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and the other will be set to the index where `l2[i + p2] == a1`.
- `p1` and `p2` will either both remain 0 if no elements in `l1` or `l2` match the conditions, or one of them will be set to 1 if a match is found.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, and `_`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
