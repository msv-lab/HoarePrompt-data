To determine what will be printed by the `print('yes')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input split by space and converted to integers.
   - `val` is a list containing at least `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`.
   - The loop iterates over the list `val`.
   - For each tuple `(a3, l3)` in `val`, it checks if `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`.
   - If any `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension, the loop breaks and prints 'no'.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, it prints 'yes'.

2. **Conditions:**
   - `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2` remain unchanged.
   - `_` is incremented by 1.
   - `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

Given these conditions, the `print('yes')` statement will only execute if the loop completes without breaking. This means that for every tuple `(a3, l3)` in the list `val`, the condition `l3 == [i for i in l if i != a3]` must hold true.

Since the exact values of `a3`, `l3`, and `l` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values. However, based on the structure of the problem, if the loop completes without breaking, the `print('yes')` statement will execute.

Output: **yes (if the loop completes without breaking, indicating that for every tuple `(a3, l3)` in `val`, `l3` is equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`)**
