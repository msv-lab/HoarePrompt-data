Postcondition: ***If `m` is equal to 1, `a1` is assigned the first integer from the input, and `l1` is assigned the remaining integers from the input. `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input split by space and converted to integers. `a2` is assigned the first integer from the input, and `l2` is assigned the remaining integers from the input. `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` that are not equal to `a2`. `val`, `a2`, `l2`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2` remain unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`. If `m` is not equal to 1 and `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than 2, `_` is `m - 3`, `t` must be greater than `m - 3`, and the program has received user input `m - 2` times. The current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
