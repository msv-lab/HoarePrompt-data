Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, `idx1` is equal to `i` if `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `p1` is 1; otherwise, `idx2` is equal to `i` and `p2` is 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If either `idx1` or `idx2` is negative, the most internal loop or if statement continues without breaking.***
