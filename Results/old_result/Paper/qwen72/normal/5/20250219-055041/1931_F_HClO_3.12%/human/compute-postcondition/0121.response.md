To determine what will be printed by the `print('no')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `m` is an integer.
   - `a1` is the first integer from the input.
   - `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.
   - `a2` is the first integer from the new input.
   - `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.
   - `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`.
   - `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or one of them is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and the other is set to the index where `l2[i + p2] == a1`.
   - `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1.
   - `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple containing the first integer and the list of the remaining integers from each new input.
   - `a3` and `l3` are set by the second tuple in `val`.
   - `_` is 0.
   - If `l3` is not equal to the list of all elements from `l` except those that are equal to `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('no')` statement is a simple print statement that prints the string `'no'`.
   - The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables or conditions.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print('no')` statement will always print the string `'no'` regardless of the values of the variables and conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **no**
