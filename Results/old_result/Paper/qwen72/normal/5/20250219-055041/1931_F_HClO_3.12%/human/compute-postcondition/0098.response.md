Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than 2, and `_` is set to `m - 3`. `i` is `n - 2` (or the last value before the loop breaks), `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or one of them is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and the other is set to the index where `l2[i + p2] == a1`. `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1. `val` is an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `l` is now equal to `l1` with `a1` inserted at the position `idx2`. Otherwise, `m` is `m - 1`, and if `m` was 2, `l11` is equal to `l22`.***
