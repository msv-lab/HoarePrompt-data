The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'yes'`. The initial state describes that `t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, and the current value of `m` is 1. However, the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
