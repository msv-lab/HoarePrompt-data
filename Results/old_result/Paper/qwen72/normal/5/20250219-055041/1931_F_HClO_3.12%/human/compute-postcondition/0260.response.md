The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m - 2` is greater than `_`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` must be greater than 3, `_` is 1, and `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `m - 2` must still be greater than `_`.

So, `_` is incremented to 2, and for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 4 (since `m - 2` must be greater than 2).

State: **`m` must be greater than 4, `_` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, and the program waits for user input.**
