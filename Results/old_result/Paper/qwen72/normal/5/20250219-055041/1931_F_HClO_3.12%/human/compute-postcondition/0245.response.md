Output State: **`val` is a list containing at least `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`. If any `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the loop breaks and prints 'no'. Otherwise, the loop completes and prints 'yes'. The values of `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `n`, `m`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `_` remain unchanged.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`val`**: This list must contain at least `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`. Each tuple is processed in the loop.
- **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each tuple in `val`. For each tuple, it checks if `l3` is equal to a list comprehension that filters out elements in `l` that are equal to `a3`.
- **Break Condition**: If any `l3` is not equal to the filtered list, the loop breaks immediately and prints 'no'.
- **Completion Condition**: If the loop completes without breaking, it prints 'yes'.
- **Other Variables**: The values of `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `n`, `m`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `_` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.
