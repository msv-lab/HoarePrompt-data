Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a2` is the first integer from the second input.
   - `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input.
   - `a1` is the first integer from the new input.
   - `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is the first integer from the new input.
   - `m` is the second integer from the new input.
   - `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`.
   - `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `idx1` is the index where `l1[i + p1]` first equals `a2` or -1 if no such index exists.
   - `idx2` is the index where `l2[i + p2]` first equals `a1` or -1 if no such index exists.
   - `p1` is 1 if `l1` contains an element equal to `a2` before `l2` contains an element equal to `a1`, otherwise `p1` is 0.
   - `p2` is 1 if `l2` contains an element equal to `a1` before `l1` contains an element equal to `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 0.
   - `val` is an empty list.
   - `_` is 1 if `m` is 1, otherwise `_` is `m - 2`.
   - All inputs have been consumed.
   - `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.
   - `m` is equal to 2.

2. **Determine the value of `_`:**
   - Since `m` is equal to 2, the value of `_` is `m - 2`, which is `2 - 2 = 0`.

3. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`.

4. **Determine the values of `idx1` and `idx2`:**
   - `idx1` is the index where `l1[i + p1]` first equals `a2` or -1 if no such index exists.
   - `idx2` is the index where `l2[i + p2]` first equals `a1` or -1 if no such index exists.
   - Given that `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, and the lists `l1` and `l2` are processed to remove elements equal to `a2` and `a1` respectively, the indices `idx1` and `idx2` are determined based on the remaining elements in `l11` and `l22`.

5. **Determine the values of `p1` and `p2`:**
   - `p1` is 1 if `l1` contains an element equal to `a2` before `l2` contains an element equal to `a1`, otherwise `p1` is 0.
   - `p2` is 1 if `l2` contains an element equal to `a1` before `l1` contains an element equal to `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 0.
   - Since `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, it implies that `l1` contains an element equal to `a2` before `l2` contains an element equal to `a1`. Therefore, `p1` is 1 and `p2` is 0.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement is `print('yes')`.
   - This statement will always print the string 'yes' regardless of the values of the variables and objects.

Output: **yes**
