Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a2` is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` is the index where `l1[i + p1]` first equals `a2` or -1 if no such index exists, `idx2` is the index where `l2[i + p2]` first equals `a1` or -1 if no such index exists, `p1` is 1 if `l1` contains an element equal to `a2` before `l2` contains an element equal to `a1`, otherwise `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1 if `l2` contains an element equal to `a1` before `l1` contains an element equal to `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 0, `val` is an empty list, `_` is 1 if `m` is 1, otherwise `_` is `m - 2`. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, `l2` is updated to contain `a2` inserted at `idx1`, and `l` is a reference to `l2`. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `l1` is updated to contain `a1` inserted at `idx2`, and `l` is a reference to `l1`. If `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l1` is updated to contain `a1` inserted at `idx2`, and `l` is a reference to `l1`. If `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, and the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l2` is updated to contain `a2` inserted at `idx1`, and `l` is a reference to `l2`. All inputs have been consumed.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input, `a1` is the first integer from the previous new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the previous new input, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the previous new input, `m` is at least 3, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` is the index where `l1[i + p1]` first equals `a2` or -1 if no such index exists, `idx2` is the index where `l2[i + p2]` first equals `a1` or -1 if no such index exists, `p1` is 1 if `l1` contains an element equal to `a2` before `l2` contains an element equal to `a1`, otherwise `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1 if `l2` contains an element equal to `a1` before `l1` contains an element equal to `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 0, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `_` is `m - 2`, all inputs have been consumed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input, `a1` is the first integer from the previous new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the previous new input, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the previous new input, `m` is at least 3, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` is the index where `l1[i + p1]` first equals `a2` or -1 if no such index exists, `idx2` is the index where `l2[i + p2]` first equals `a1` or -1 if no such index exists, `p1` is 1 if `l1` contains an element equal to `a2` before `l2` contains an element equal to `a1`, otherwise `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1 if `l2` contains an element equal to `a1` before `l1` contains an element equal to `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 0, `val` is a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)`, `_` is `m - 3`, all inputs have been consumed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input, `a1` is the first integer from the previous new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the previous new input, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the previous new input, `m` is at least 3, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` is the index where `l1[i + p1]` first equals `a2` or -1 if no such index exists, `idx2` is the index where `l2[i + p2]` first equals `a1` or -1 if no such index exists, `p1` is 1 if `l1` contains an element equal to `a2` before `l2` contains an element equal to `a1`, otherwise `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1 if `l2` contains an element equal to `a1` before `l1` contains an element equal to `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 0, `val` is a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)`, `(a3, l3)`, and `(a3, l3)`, `_` is `m - 2`, all inputs have been consumed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
