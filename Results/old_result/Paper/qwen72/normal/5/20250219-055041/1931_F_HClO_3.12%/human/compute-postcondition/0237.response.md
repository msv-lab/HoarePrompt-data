To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Given Loop:
```python
for (a3, l3) in val:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of the form `(a3, l3)`.
- `a3` and `l3` are set to the values of the first tuple in `val`.
- If `l3` is not equal to the list of elements in `l` that are not equal to `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `a3` and `l3`, which are unpacked from the tuples in `val`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more tuples in `val` to unpack.
3. **State Adjustments**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a3` and `l3` were set to the values of the first tuple in `val`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple in `val` must be unpacked into `a3` and `l3`.
   - Therefore, `a3` and `l3` need to be updated to the values of the next tuple in `val`.

### Adjusted State:
- `val` must still contain at least 1 tuple (since it had at least 1 tuple at the end of the previous iteration, and the loop will continue if there is another tuple).
- `a3` and `l3` must be set to the values of the next tuple in `val`.

### Final State:
State: **`val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of the form `(a3, l3)`, `a3` and `l3` are set to the values of the next tuple in `val`**.
