Let's analyze the initial state and the given conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - `cnt1` is either less than or equal to 2, or `cnt1` is odd.
   - `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2.
   - `cnt1` is not equal to 1.
   - The string `s` contains the substring '11'.

Given these conditions, let's break down the possible values of `cnt1`:
- `cnt1` must be less than or equal to 2.
- `cnt1` cannot be 1.
- `cnt1` must be either 0 or 2 (since it cannot be 1 and must be less than or equal to 2).

Additionally, the string `s` contains the substring '11'. This means that `s` must have at least two consecutive '1's. Therefore, `cnt1` must be at least 2.

Combining these constraints:
- `cnt1` must be 2 (since it cannot be 1 and must be less than or equal to 2, and `s` must contain the substring '11').

Given that `cnt1` is 2 and the string `s` contains the substring '11', the conditions are satisfied, and the code will execute the `print` statement.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

Since the conditions are met, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
