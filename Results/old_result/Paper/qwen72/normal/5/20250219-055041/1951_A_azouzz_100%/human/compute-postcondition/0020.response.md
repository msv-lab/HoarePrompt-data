Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2, then `cnt1` is odd. If `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2, then `cnt1` is either 1 (which is odd) or less than or equal to 2. The condition for `cnt1` remains unchanged if `s` contains the substring '11' or does not contain it.***
