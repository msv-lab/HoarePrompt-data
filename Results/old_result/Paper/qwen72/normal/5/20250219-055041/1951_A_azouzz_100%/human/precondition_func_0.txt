The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` expects `start` and `end` to be integers where `start` is less than or equal to `end`. The current working directory should contain subfolders, and the names of these subfolders should be convertible to integers. The subfolders may contain files, and the function will specifically look for files with a `.html` extension.
