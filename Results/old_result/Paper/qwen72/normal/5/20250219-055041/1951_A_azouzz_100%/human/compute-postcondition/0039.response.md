Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is a new input string.
- `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`.
- `_` is 2.
- If `cnt1` > 2 and `cnt1` % 2 == 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables also remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` is greater than 0, but it is not used in the code snippet.
   - `n` is an input integer, but it is not used in the code snippet.
   - `s` is a new input string, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`.
   - `_` is 2, but it is not used in the code snippet.
   - The condition `if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0` is checked, but it does not affect the state of the variables if it is true or false. The state remains unchanged in both cases.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string 'YES'.
   - The condition `if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0` does not influence the execution of the `print` statement because the state of the variables remains unchanged regardless of whether the condition is true or false.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print 'YES' because the condition does not affect the execution of the `print` statement.

Output: **YES**
