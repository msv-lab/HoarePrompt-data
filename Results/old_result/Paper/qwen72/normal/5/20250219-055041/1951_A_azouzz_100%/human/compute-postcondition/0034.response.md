Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`, and `_` is 1. If `cnt1` > 2 and `cnt1` % 2 == 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables also remains unchanged.***
