Let's analyze the initial state and the given code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`.
   - `cnt1` is either less than or equal to 2, or `cnt1` is odd.
   - `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2.
   - `cnt1` is not equal to 1.
   - The string `s` does not contain the substring '11'.

2. **Determine the possible values of `cnt1`:**
   - `cnt1` must be less than or equal to 2.
   - `cnt1` must be either less than or equal to 2 or odd.
   - `cnt1` must be less than or equal to 2.
   - `cnt1` must not be equal to 1.
   - Therefore, the possible values for `cnt1` are 0 or 2.

3. **Check the conditions for `s`:**
   - `s` does not contain the substring '11'.
   - If `cnt1` is 0, `s` does not contain any '1's.
   - If `cnt1` is 2, `s` contains exactly two '1's, and they are not consecutive.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The conditions for `cnt1` and the structure of `s` are met.
   - The `print('YES')` statement will execute and print 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
