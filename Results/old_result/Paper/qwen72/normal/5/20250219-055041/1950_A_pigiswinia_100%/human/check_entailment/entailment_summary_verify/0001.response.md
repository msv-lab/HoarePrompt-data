### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. This is done using `map(int, input().split())`, which is appropriate for splitting the input line and converting the parts to integers.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if the digits form a stair by evaluating the condition `a < b < c`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - If the condition is false, it checks if the digits form a peak by evaluating the condition `a < b > c`.
   - If the peak condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither condition is true, it prints "NONE".

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions provided in the problem description.
   - The output is printed directly to the console, which is consistent with the problem's requirement.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the input format by reading the number of test cases and then reading three digits for each test case.
- The conditions `a < b < c` and `a < b > c` are correctly implemented to check for a stair and a peak, respectively.
- The program prints "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the conditions, which matches the problem description.

### Example Test Cases:
- For the input `1 2 3`, the program will print "STAIR" because `1 < 2 < 3`.
- For the input `3 2 1`, the program will print "NONE" because neither `3 < 2 < 1` nor `3 < 2 > 1` is true.
- For the input `1 5 3`, the program will print "PEAK" because `1 < 5 > 3`.
- For the input `0 0 0`, the program will print "NONE" because neither `0 < 0 < 0` nor `0 < 0 > 0` is true.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither, and it handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. The function summary confirms that the program's behavior aligns with the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
