Reasoning:  
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles the input and output as specified. It reads the number of test cases, `t`, and for each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. The program then checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`), and prints the appropriate result. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'. The logic and flow of the program are consistent with the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
