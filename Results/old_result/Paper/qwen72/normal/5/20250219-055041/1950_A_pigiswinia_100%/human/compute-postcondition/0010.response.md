Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, and it is not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then the condition `a < b > c` holds. Otherwise, the condition `a < b > c` does not hold.***
