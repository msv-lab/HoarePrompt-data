Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are digits (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is `t-1`, and for each iteration `i` from 0 to `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds, and 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then the condition `a < b > c` holds, and 'PEAK' is printed. If neither of these conditions is met, then 'NONE' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, where `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`. It then evaluates the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
