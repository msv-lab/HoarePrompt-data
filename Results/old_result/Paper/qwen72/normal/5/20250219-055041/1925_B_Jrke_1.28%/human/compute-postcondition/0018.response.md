Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is between 1 and the new value of `x`, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is 1, `i` is 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0). If `x % i` is 0, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, where `l` is a list containing the values 1 and, if `i` <= `k`, also `i`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains `x // i`. If `x % i` is not 0, `ans` remains 1 and `l` is not modified.***
