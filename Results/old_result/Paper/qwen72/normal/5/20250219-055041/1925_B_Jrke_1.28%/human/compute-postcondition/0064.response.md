Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer input such that `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) < int(x)`, `i` is `i + 2`, `l` is a list containing `ans`, and `ans` remains unchanged if `x % i != 0`.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^3.
- `x` remains the first integer input that satisfies the condition `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) < int(x)`.
- `i` is incremented by 2.
- `l` is updated to be a list containing the value of `ans`.
- `ans` remains unchanged if `x % i != 0`.
