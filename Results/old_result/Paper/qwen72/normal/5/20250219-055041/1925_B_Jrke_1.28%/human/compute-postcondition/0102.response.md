Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the new first integer input and must be greater than 1 if even, `n` is the new second integer input, `k` is the integer division of the new `x` by the new `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is `int(x) + 4`, `ans` is 1, and `l` is a list containing the value 1. If `i` <= `k`, `l` is updated to contain the values [1, `int(x) + 4`]. Otherwise, `l` remains a list containing the value 1.***
