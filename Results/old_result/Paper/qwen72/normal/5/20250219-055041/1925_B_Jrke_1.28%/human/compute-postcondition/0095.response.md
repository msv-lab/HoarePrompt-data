Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the new first integer input and must be greater than 1 if even, `n` is the new second integer input, `k` is the integer division of the new `x` by the new `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is `int(x) + 2`, `ans` is 1, and `l` is a list containing the values 1 and `x // (int(x) + 2)`. If `i` <= `k`, `l` also contains the value `int(x) + 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l.append(x // i)` appends the result of `x // i` to the list `l`.
- `i` is `int(x) + 2`.
- `x // i` is the integer division of `x` by `i`.
- `l` originally contains the value 1, and if `i` <= `k`, it also contains `int(x) + 2`.
- After executing the code, `l` will contain the value 1 and the result of `x // (int(x) + 2)`.
- The other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
