### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of a set of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums to `x`.
   - The GCD of the sub-problems should be maximized.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `x` is divisible by `n`, then the maximum GCD is `x // n` because we can create `n` sub-problems each with difficulty `x // n`.
   - If `x` is not divisible by `n`, we need to find the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k = x // n`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates `k = x // n`.
   - If `k == 1`, it prints 1 and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if `k` is 1, the only possible GCD is 1.
   - It initializes `ans` to 1, which is the default GCD if no larger divisor is found.
   - It iterates over possible divisors `i` from 1 to the square root of `x` (inclusive), checking if `i` is a divisor of `x`.
   - If `i` is a divisor, it checks if `i` or `x // i` is less than or equal to `k` and updates `ans` to the maximum of these values.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program only checks odd divisors starting from 1 (or 2 if `x` is even) up to the square root of `x`. This might miss some even divisors.
   - The program should also check even divisors if `x` is even.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach is to find the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - This can be done by iterating from `k` down to 1 and checking if the number is a divisor of `x`.

### Correctness:
- The program is **not** correct because it only checks odd divisors and might miss the correct answer if the largest divisor is even.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(k, 0, -1):
            if x % i == 0:
                ans = i
                break
        print(ans)
```
