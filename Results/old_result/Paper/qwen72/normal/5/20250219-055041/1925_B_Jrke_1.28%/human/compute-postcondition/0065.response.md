Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer input such that `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) < int(x)`, `i` is `i + 2`, `l` is a list containing `ans` and `i`, and `ans` remains unchanged if `x % i != 0`.** 

The value of `i` is appended to the list `l`, so `l` now contains `ans` and `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
