Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer input, `n` is the second integer input, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is the value of `x`, `ans` is 1. If `k` == 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer input such that `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) < int(x)`. If `x % i == 0`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`. Additionally, if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains the value of `x // i`, and if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains the value of `i`. `ans` is the maximum value in `l`. If `x % i != 0`, the values of `l` and `ans` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer input such that `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) < int(x)`, `i` is `i + 2`, and `l` and `ans` remain unchanged if `x % i != 0`. If `x % i == 0`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is either `[ans]`, `[ans, i]`, `[ans, x // i]`, or `[ans, i, x // i]` depending on the conditions `x // i` <= `k` and `i` <= `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer input such that `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) < int(x)`, `i` is `i + 2`, `l` and `ans` remain unchanged if `x % i != 0`. If `x % i == 0`, `l` is a list containing `ans` and possibly `i` if `i <= k`. If `x // i <= k`, `l` also contains `x // i` and `ans` remains unchanged if `x % i != 0`. Otherwise, `l` does not contain `x // i` and `ans` remains unchanged if `x % i != 0`. `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
