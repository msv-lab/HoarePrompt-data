Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes the first and second integers of `num_list` as keys with their values increased appropriately. If `x` is in `num_of_lens`, then `num_of_lens` also includes `x` as a key with its value increased appropriately. Otherwise, `num_of_lens` includes `x` as a key with a value of 1.***
