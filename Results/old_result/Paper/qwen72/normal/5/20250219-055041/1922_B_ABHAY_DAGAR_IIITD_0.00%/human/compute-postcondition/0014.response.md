Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes the first integer of `num_list` as a key with its value increased by 1. If `x` is in `num_of_lens`, `x`'s value in `num_of_lens` is increased by 1. If `x` is not in `num_of_lens`, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with its value set to 1.***
