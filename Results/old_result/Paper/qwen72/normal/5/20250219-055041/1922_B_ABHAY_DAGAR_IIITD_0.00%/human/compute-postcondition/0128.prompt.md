Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `num_list` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `total_count` is 0, `x` is the last integer in the `num_list`, `n` is an input integer, `res` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
    if cnt >= 2:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
    total_count += cnt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `cnt`, `x` is the last integer in the `num_list`, `n` is an input integer, and `cnt` is the first value from `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` which is 0. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is `cnt + cnt`, `x` is the last integer in the `num_list`, `n` is an input integer, and `cnt` is the second value from `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * (cnt + cnt)`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is `cnt + cnt + cnt`, `x` is the last integer in the `num_list`, `n` is an input integer, and `cnt` is the third value from `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
