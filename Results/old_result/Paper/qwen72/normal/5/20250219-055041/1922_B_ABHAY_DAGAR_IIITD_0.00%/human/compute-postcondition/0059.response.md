Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least 3 integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes the first, second, and third integers in `num_list` as keys with their values incremented appropriately, `res` is the sum of the combinations of choosing 3 elements from each integer's count plus the sum of the products of choosing 2 elements from each integer's count and the total count of all processed elements, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`, and `x` is the third integer in `num_list`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. The variable `x` is the third integer in `num_list`, so the count for this integer in `num_of_lens` is increased. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `num_list`, `res`, and `total_count`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `num_of_lens` includes the first and second integers in `num_list` as keys with their values incremented appropriately is still valid, and now it also includes the third integer with its value incremented.
