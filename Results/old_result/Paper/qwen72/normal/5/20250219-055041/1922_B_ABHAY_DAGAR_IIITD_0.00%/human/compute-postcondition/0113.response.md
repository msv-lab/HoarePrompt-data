Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is 0, `x` is the last integer in the `num_list`, `n` is an input integer, `cnt` is the first value from `num_of_lens.values()`, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. `res` is updated to `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` which is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Since `total_count` is 0, the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` evaluates to 0, so `res` remains unchanged at 0. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet.
