Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least `n` integers, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes each integer from `num_list` as a key with its value representing the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations, the `num_of_lens` dictionary will contain each unique integer from the `num_list` as a key, and the value associated with each key will be the number of times that integer appears in the `num_list`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
