The only objects in the loop head are the variables `cnt` and `num_of_lens`. The loop iterates over the values of `num_of_lens`, so the state that needs to be adjusted is `cnt`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` is the second value from `num_of_lens.values()`. For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`.

Since `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, for the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is `cnt + cnt`, `x` is the last integer in the `num_list`, `n` is an input integer, and `cnt` is the third value from `num_of_lens.values()`.**
