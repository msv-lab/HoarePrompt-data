The only objects in the loop head are the variable `cnt` and the dictionary `num_of_lens`. The loop iterates over the values of `num_of_lens`, so the state of `cnt` and the structure of `num_of_lens` are the only ones that can be adjusted.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `num_list` is a list of integers with at least `n` integers.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes each integer from `num_list` as a key with its value representing the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list` and must have at least one key-value pair.
- `total_count` is `cnt` added to its previous value.
- `cnt` is a value from `num_of_lens` and if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of `res` is not modified.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The dictionary `num_of_lens` must have at least one more key-value pair to iterate over.
- The variable `cnt` will be the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

Since `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `num_of_lens` must have at least two key-value pairs. The state of `cnt` will be the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least `n` integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes each integer from `num_list` as a key with its value representing the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list` and must have at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is the sum of the previous `cnt` values, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens` and if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of `res` is not modified.**
