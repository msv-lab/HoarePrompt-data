Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the number of sticks `n` and the list of exponents `num_list`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**: The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each exponent in `num_list`. This is a valid approach to group sticks of the same length.

3. **Triangle Formation Conditions**:
   - For a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.
   - Given that the lengths of the sticks are powers of 2, the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if all three sticks have the same length. This is because the lengths are \(2^{a_i}\), and for any three distinct exponents \(a_i, a_j, a_k\) where \(a_i < a_j < a_k\), the sum \(2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j}\) will always be less than \(2^{a_k}\).

4. **Combinatorial Calculations**:
   - The program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \cdot (cnt - 1) \cdot (cnt - 2)}{6} \) for each exponent with a count of at least 3.
   - It also correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length using the formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} \cdot total_count = \frac{cnt \cdot (cnt - 1)}{2} \cdot total_count \) for each exponent with a count of at least 2.

5. **Output Handling**: The program stores the results in a list `results` and prints each result after processing all test cases. This is a valid way to handle multiple test cases and ensure the output is in the correct format.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `n` is 1 or when there are no valid combinations to form a triangle.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
