Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `cnt`, `x` is the last integer in the `num_list`, `n` is an input integer, and `cnt` is the first value from `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` which is 0. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `total_count += cnt` increments the value of `total_count` by `cnt`.
- The initial value of `total_count` is 0, so after the increment, `total_count` becomes `cnt`.
- The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `x`, `n`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
- The condition for updating `res` is not affected by this code snippet, so `res` remains 0 if `cnt` is less than 2, or it is updated to `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` which is 0 if `cnt` is 2 or greater.
