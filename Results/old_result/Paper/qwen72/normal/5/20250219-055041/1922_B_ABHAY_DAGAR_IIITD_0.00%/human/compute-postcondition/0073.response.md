The only objects in the loop head are the variable `cnt` and the dictionary `num_of_lens`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `num_of_lens` dictionary having more key-value pairs. At the end of the last iteration, `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair, and `cnt` is the value of the first key in `num_of_lens`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num_of_lens` must have at least two key-value pairs, and `cnt` will be the value of the second key in `num_of_lens`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` must have at least two key-value pairs, `cnt` is the value of the second key in `num_of_lens`, `total_count` is the value of the first key in `num_of_lens`, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. If `cnt` is 2, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains 0.**
