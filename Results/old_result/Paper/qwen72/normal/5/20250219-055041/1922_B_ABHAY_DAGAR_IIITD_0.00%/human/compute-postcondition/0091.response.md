The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `num_list`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_list`. If `num_list` has at least one integer, the loop will execute. The variable `x` will be set to the first integer in `num_list` at the start of the loop.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` (which is 0), `x` is the first integer in the new `num_list`, `n` is an input integer.**
