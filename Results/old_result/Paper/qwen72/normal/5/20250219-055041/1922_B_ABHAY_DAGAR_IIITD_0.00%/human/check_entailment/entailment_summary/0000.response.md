Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of ways to choose three sticks from a list of sticks with lengths \(2^{a_i}\) that can form a non-degenerate triangle. The key observation here is that for three sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick. Given the lengths are powers of 2, this condition can only be met if the exponents of the lengths are the same or differ by at most 1. 

The program works as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of exponents `num_list`.
3. It counts the occurrences of each exponent using a dictionary `num_of_lens`.
4. It then calculates the number of valid triangles:
   - If there are at least 3 sticks with the same exponent, it counts the combinations of choosing 3 sticks from these.
   - If there are at least 2 sticks with the same exponent, it counts the combinations of choosing 2 sticks from these and pairing them with any of the previously counted sticks.
5. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The logic in the program is correct and aligns with the problem requirements. It correctly handles the cases where the exponents are the same and where they differ by at most 1, which are the only cases where a non-degenerate triangle can be formed with powers of 2.

However, there is a minor issue with the initial call to `func_1(t)`. The function `func_1` expects an integer `test_cases`, but it is called with the number of test cases `t` directly. This should be fine, but it's worth noting that the function name `func_1` is not very descriptive and could be improved for clarity.

Given the provided execution summary, the program appears to work correctly and produce the expected results for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
