Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct for solving the given problem. Here's a detailed explanation of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**: It uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length (which is the exponent in `2^a_i`).

3. **Calculating Combinations**:
   - **Same Length Combinations**: For each stick length that appears at least 3 times, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.
   - **Two Same Length, One Different**: For each stick length that appears at least 2 times, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length using the formula `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, where `total_count` is the cumulative count of all previously processed stick lengths.

4. **Output**: The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

The logic used in the program ensures that it counts all valid combinations of sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. The constraints are also handled appropriately, and the program should work efficiently within the given limits.

Therefore, the program is correct.
