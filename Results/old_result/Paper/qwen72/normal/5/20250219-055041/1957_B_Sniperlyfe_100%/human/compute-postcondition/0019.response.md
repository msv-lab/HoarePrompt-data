The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The function returns a list `nums` of length `n` where the first element is calculated as \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1 + k\). The subsequent elements in the list are set to the minimum of the previous element plus 1 and the remaining value of `k` at each iteration until `k` becomes 0.
