### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results of each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is responsible for generating the sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.
   - It initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.

3. **Setting the First Element:**
   - The first element `nums[0]` is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\). This value is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - This ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

4. **Distributing the Remaining Sum:**
   - The remaining value of `k` is subtracted by `nums[0]`.
   - The program then iterates through the remaining elements of `nums` (from index 1 to `n-1`).
   - For each element, it sets `nums[i]` to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining value of `k`.
   - This ensures that the sum of the sequence remains `k` while trying to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

5. **Final Adjustment:**
   - After the loop, if there is any remaining value in `k`, it is added to the first element `nums[0]`.
   - This ensures that the sum of the sequence is exactly `k`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program appends the generated sequence to the `results` list and prints the results for all test cases.

### Analysis:
- **Sum Condition:** The sum of the elements in `nums` is correctly maintained to be `k` throughout the process.
- **Maximizing 1s in Bitwise OR:**
  - By setting the first element to the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`, the program ensures that the bitwise OR will have the maximum number of 1s.
  - The subsequent elements are set to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k`, which helps in distributing the sum while keeping the number of 1s in the bitwise OR as high as possible.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
