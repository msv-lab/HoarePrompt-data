You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of length `n`. The first element of the list is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\). Each subsequent element is the minimum of the previous element plus 1 and the remaining value of `k` at each iteration, until `k` becomes 0. If `k` is not fully used up by the end of the loop, the remaining value of `k` is added to the first element of the list. The final state of the program is that `nums` is a list of length `n` where the first element is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1 + \text{remaining } k\) and the subsequent elements are set as described.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum is `k`.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers.

2. **Approach in the Provided Program:**
   - The program initializes an array `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets the first element `nums[0]` to the largest number that can be represented with the number of bits equal to the bit length of `k` minus one. This is done using the expression `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
   - The value of `k` is then reduced by `nums[0]`.
   - For the remaining elements in the array, it tries to distribute the remaining value of `k` such that each element is as small as possible but still contributes to the sum.
   - If `k` is still positive after distributing to the first `n-1` elements, the remaining value is added to `nums[0]`.

3. **Analysis of the Approach:**
   - **Sum Condition:** The sum of the elements in `nums` should be equal to `k`. The program ensures this by initially setting `nums[0]` to a large value and then distributing the remaining `k` among the other elements.
   - **Maximizing 1s in Bitwise OR:**
     - By setting `nums[0]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, the program ensures that `nums[0]` has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation for the given bit length.
     - The remaining elements are set to small values (either 0 or 1) to minimize their impact on the bitwise OR while still contributing to the sum. This approach ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of 1s possible.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Element (`n = 1`):** The program correctly handles this case by setting `nums[0]` to `k` and returning it.
   - **Multiple Elements (`n > 1`):** The program distributes the remaining `k` among the other elements, ensuring that the sum condition is met and the bitwise OR is maximized.

5. **Correctness:**
   - The program correctly constructs the sequence to meet both conditions: the sum of the elements is `k`, and the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR is maximized.
   - The approach is efficient and works within the given constraints.
