Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element `nums[0]` set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\) and the rest of the elements initialized to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `nums[0]` is updated to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\).
- The rest of the elements in `nums` remain 0.
- The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
