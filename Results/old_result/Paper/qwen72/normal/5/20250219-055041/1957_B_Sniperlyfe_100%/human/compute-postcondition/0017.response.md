Output State: **`n` is the same as the initial state, `k` is 0, `nums` is a list of length `n` where the first element `nums[0]` is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1 + k\) and the subsequent elements are set to the minimum of the previous element plus 1 and the remaining value of `k` at each iteration until `k` becomes 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `nums[0]` is incremented by `k`.
- Since `k` is 0, the value of `nums[0]` remains \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\), which simplifies to \(2^{0 - 1} - 1 = 2^{-1} - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1\).
- Therefore, `nums[0]` becomes \(-1 + 0 = -1\).
- The subsequent elements in `nums` are not affected by this code snippet.
- The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
