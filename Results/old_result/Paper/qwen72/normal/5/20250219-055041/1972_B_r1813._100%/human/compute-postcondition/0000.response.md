Output State: **The function is now set to read input from `sys.stdin`. The initial state variables `t` and the list of tuples are not affected.**

Explanation: The line `input = sys.stdin.read` reassigns the `input` function to read from `sys.stdin`, but it does not change the values of `t` or the list of tuples. The function is now prepared to read input from the standard input stream, but the specific values of `t` and the list of tuples remain as they were initially defined.
