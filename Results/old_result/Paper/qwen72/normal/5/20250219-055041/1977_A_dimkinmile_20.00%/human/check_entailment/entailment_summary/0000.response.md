Reasoning:  
The program provided is not entirely correct. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. The function checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes in the tower) and prints 'Yes' if this condition is met. However, this logic does not account for the fact that Nikita can both add and remove cubes from the tower. 

To determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, we need to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of `n` and `m`. Specifically:
- If `n` is even, the number of cubes in the tower can only be even (since each pair of moves can either add or remove a cube, resulting in no net change or a net change of 2 cubes).
- If `n` is odd, the number of cubes in the tower can only be odd (since the last move will either add or remove a cube, changing the parity).

Therefore, the correct condition to check is whether `n` and `m` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd).

The provided program does not check for this parity condition, and instead, it only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. This is insufficient and will lead to incorrect results in some cases.

For example:
- For the test case `2 4`, the program will print 'Yes' because `2 >= 4` is false, but the correct answer should be 'No' because `n` and `m` have different parities.
- For the test case `5 3`, the program will print 'Yes' because `5 >= 3` is true, but the correct answer should also be 'Yes' because `n` and `m` have the same parity.

Correctness: **False**
