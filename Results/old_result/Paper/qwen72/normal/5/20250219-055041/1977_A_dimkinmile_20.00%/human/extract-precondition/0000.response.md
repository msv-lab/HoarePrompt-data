Precondition: **The function should take two parameters, n and m, where n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.** 

However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func_1(n, m):
```

With the precondition:

**n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.**
