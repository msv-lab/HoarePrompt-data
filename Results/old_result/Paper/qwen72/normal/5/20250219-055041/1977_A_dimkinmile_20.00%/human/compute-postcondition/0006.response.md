The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are integers with the constraint that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. 

Since the output description is incomplete, I cannot fully determine the functionality of the function. However, based on the given information, the function is designed to accept two integers within a specified range.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, both of which are integers between 1 and 100, inclusive.**
