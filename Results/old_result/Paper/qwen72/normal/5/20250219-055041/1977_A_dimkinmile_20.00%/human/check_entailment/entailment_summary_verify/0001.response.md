Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` and iterates over each test case. This is a standard and correct way to handle multiple test cases in Python.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle each test case. It reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, which represent the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

3. **Logic for Determining Possibility**:
   - The program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.
   - If `n >= m`, it prints "Yes".
   - If `n < m`, it prints "No".

4. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic is based on the idea that Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move.
   - While it is true that `n` must be at least `m` for Nikita to potentially have `m` cubes, this condition alone is not sufficient to determine the possibility.
   - The key aspect missing from the logic is the consideration of the parity of `n` and `m`. Nikita can only change the number of cubes in the tower by 1 with each move, which means the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of cubes in the tower will match the parity of the number of moves.

5. **Parity Consideration**:
   - To correctly determine if Nikita can end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, we need to check if the parity of `n` and `m` is the same.
   - If `n` and `m` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd), then it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes.
   - If `n` and `m` have different parities, it is not possible.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly handle the parity condition.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.

Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program's logic is incomplete and does not consider the parity of `n` and `m`, which is crucial for determining the possibility of ending up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
