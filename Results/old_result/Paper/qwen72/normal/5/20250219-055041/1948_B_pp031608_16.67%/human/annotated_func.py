#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers where each integer is in the range 0 to 99, inclusive.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list `lst` is equal to the list `sorted_lst`. Since `sorted_lst` is a sorted version of `lst`, the program returns `True` if `lst` was already sorted in ascending order, and `False` otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` where each integer is between 0 and 99, inclusive. It returns `True` if the list `lst` is already sorted in ascending order, and `False` otherwise. The function does not modify the input list `lst`.
