You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` where each integer is between 0 and 99, inclusive. It returns `True` if the list `lst` is already sorted in ascending order, and `False` otherwise. The function does not modify the input list `lst`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.

2. **Sorting Check Function**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version. This is a valid and efficient way to check if a list is sorted.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates through each element of the array starting from the second element.
   - It checks if the current element is less than the previous element and if the previous element is greater than or equal to 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the list at the appropriate positions.

4. **Insertion Logic**:
   - The program correctly splits the element `a` into its tens and units digits using integer division (`a // 10`) and modulo (`a % 10`).
   - It then removes the original element and inserts the digits in the correct positions.

5. **Final Check**:
   - After processing the array, the program uses `func_1` to check if the array is now sorted.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues and Concerns:
- **Infinite Loop Potential**:
  - The program does not handle the case where the array might need multiple iterations to become sorted. For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the first iteration will split `12` into `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, but the array is still not sorted. The program should continue to split and check until the array is sorted or until no more splits are possible.

- **Incorrect Splitting Logic**:
  - The program only splits elements if the previous element is greater than 10 and the current element is less than the previous element. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of splitting elements that are greater than 10 but do not cause an immediate out-of-order condition. For example, in the array `[12, 28, 5]`, the program will not split `28` because `12` is not greater than `28`.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program should use a more efficient approach to determine if the array can be sorted by splitting elements. It should consider all elements that are greater than or equal to 10 and split them, then check if the resulting array is sorted.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not handle the potential need for multiple iterations to sort the array and it has flawed logic for determining which elements to split.

### Correctness: **False**
