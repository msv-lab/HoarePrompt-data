The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 3, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1], `line` is a new string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer, `i` is 3, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.**
