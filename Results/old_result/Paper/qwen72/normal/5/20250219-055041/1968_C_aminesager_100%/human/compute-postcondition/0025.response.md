Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 2, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1], `line` is a new string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer, `i` is 2, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0].
- The code `a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])` appends the value `a[1] + T[1]` to the list `a`.
- Since `i` is 2, `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]`, which is 1000 + T[0].
- Therefore, the new element appended to `a` is (1000 + T[0]) + T[1], which simplifies to 1000 + T[0] + T[1].
- The values of `t`, `n`, `line`, `T`, `i`, and `result` remain unchanged.
