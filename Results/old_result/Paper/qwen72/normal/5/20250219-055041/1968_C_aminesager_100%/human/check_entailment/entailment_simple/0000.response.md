### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list of `n-1` integers `T`.

2. **Array Initialization:**
   - The array `a` is initialized with a single element `[1000]`. This is a valid starting point because `1000` is within the allowed range (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

3. **Array Construction:**
   - The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), which is correct because `a` should have `n` elements.
   - Each new element `a[i]` is constructed as `a[i-1] + T[i-1]`. This ensures that `a[i] % a[i-1]` will be equal to `T[i-1]` (i.e., `x_i`), which satisfies the condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function correctly converts the list `a` to a string with elements separated by spaces and prints it.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the minimum and maximum values of `n` and `t` as specified in the problem description.
   - The initial value of `a[0]` is `1000`, which is a safe choice because it is large enough to ensure that the subsequent elements will be within the allowed range (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

6. **Validation:**
   - The program correctly constructs the array `a` such that the conditions are met for all test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly constructs the array `a` based on the given conditions and handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
