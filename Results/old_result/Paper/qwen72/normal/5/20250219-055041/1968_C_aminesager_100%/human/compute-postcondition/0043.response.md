Output State: **`i` is `n` - 1, `n` is the same as the initial input, `a` has `n` elements, where each new element from index 1 to `n-1` is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `T`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, which is the last value it takes in the loop.
- The variable `n` remains the same as it was initially provided.
- The list `a` will have `n` elements. The first element of `a` remains 1000, and each subsequent element from index 1 to `n-1` is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in the list `T`.
