Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer between 2 and 500, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `line` is a string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer, `i` is `n` - 1, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces**

Explanation:
- `t` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `t - 1`. Since `t` was initially between 1 and 10^4 - 1, after the decrement, `t` is now between 0 and 10^4 - 2.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `line`, `T`, `i`, and `result`) remain unchanged.
