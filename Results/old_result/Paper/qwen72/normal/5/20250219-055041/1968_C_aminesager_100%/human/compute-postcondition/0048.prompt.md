You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the number of elements in the array a, and a list of n-1 integers x_2, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500) representing the elements of the array x. The sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        line = input('')
        
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        
        a = [1000]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
        
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is the same as the initial input, `a` has `n` elements, where each new element from index 1 to `n-1` is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `T`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. It returns the missing integer from the list `x` that would make the array `a` complete, where `a` is expected to have `n` elements.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
