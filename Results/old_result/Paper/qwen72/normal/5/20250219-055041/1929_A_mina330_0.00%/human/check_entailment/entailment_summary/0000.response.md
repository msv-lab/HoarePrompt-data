Reasoning:
The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all \( i \) from 2 to \( n \). The key insight here is that to maximize the beauty, we should maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then pairing the smallest elements with the largest elements, which ensures the differences are maximized.

Let's break down the program:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `ntest`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `a`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order.

3. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a variable `kq` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the first half of the sorted array and calculates the sum of the differences between the corresponding pairs of elements from the end and the beginning of the sorted list.
   - Specifically, it calculates \( kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i] \) for \( i \) from 0 to \( \frac{n}{2} - 1 \).

4. **Output**:
   - The calculated beauty `kq` is printed for each test case.

The logic of the program is correct because:
- Sorting the array ensures that the largest elements are paired with the smallest elements, which maximizes the differences.
- The sum of these differences is indeed the maximum beauty of the array.

However, there is a small optimization that can be made. Instead of iterating over the first half of the array, we can simply calculate the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements, which is equivalent to the sum of the differences between the pairs.

Given the problem constraints and the execution summary, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array.

Correctness: **True**
