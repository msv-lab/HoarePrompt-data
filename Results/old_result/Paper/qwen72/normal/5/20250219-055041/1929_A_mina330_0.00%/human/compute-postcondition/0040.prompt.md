Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ntest` is an input integer between 1 and 500, the function should still take two parameters: `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and a list of lists where each inner list contains `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    kq = 0
    for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
        kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
    print(kq)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ntest` must be greater than 0, `itest` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` is the sum of the differences between the corresponding pairs of elements from the end and the beginning of the list `a` for the first half of the list, `i` is `len(a) // 2 - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ntest` must be greater than 1, `itest` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` is the sum of the differences between the corresponding pairs of elements from the end and the beginning of the list `a` up to the middle, `i` is `len(a) // 2 - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(a) // 2 - 1`, `kq` is the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the beginning of the list `a` for the first half of the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
