Functionality: ** The function reads a series of test cases from the user. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, sorts the list, and calculates the sum of the differences between the corresponding pairs of elements from the end and the beginning of the sorted list for the first half of the list. It prints this sum for each test case. The function does not return any values. After the function concludes, the input values for `ntest`, `itest`, `n`, `a`, and `kq` are no longer relevant as they are local to the function. **
