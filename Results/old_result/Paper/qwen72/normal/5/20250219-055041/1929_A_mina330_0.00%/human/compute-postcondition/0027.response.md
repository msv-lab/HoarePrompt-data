The only variables in the loop head are `itest` and `ntest`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `itest` being less than `ntest`. At the end of the last iteration, `ntest` is greater than 1 and `itest` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `itest` must be incremented by 1, and `ntest` must still be greater than the new value of `itest`.

State: **`ntest` must be greater than 2, `itest` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` is the sum of the differences between the corresponding pairs of elements from the end and the beginning of the list `a` up to the middle, `i` is `len(a) // 2 - 1`**
