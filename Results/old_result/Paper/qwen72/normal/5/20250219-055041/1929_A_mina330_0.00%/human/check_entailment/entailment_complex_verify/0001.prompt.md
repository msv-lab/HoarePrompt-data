You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        print(kq)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a for each test case.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        kq = 0
        
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        
        print(kq)
        
    #State: `ntest` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `itest` is `ntest - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` is the sum of the differences between the corresponding pairs of elements from the end and the beginning of the list `a` for the first half of the list, `i` is `len(a) // 2 - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of test cases from the user. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, sorts the list, and calculates the sum of the differences between the corresponding pairs of elements from the end and the beginning of the sorted list for the first half of the list. It prints this sum for each test case. The function does not return any values. After the function concludes, the input values for `ntest`, `itest`, `n`, `a`, and `kq` are no longer relevant as they are local to the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize this sum, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Approach**:
   - Sorting the array and then pairing the largest and smallest elements to maximize the differences is a good strategy.
   - By sorting the array, we can ensure that the differences between the largest and smallest elements are maximized.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case:
     - Read the length of the array \(n\).
     - Read the array elements and sort them.
     - Calculate the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements in pairs.

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases \(ntest\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the array elements.
   - It sorts the array \(a\).
   - It initializes a variable \(kq\) to 0 to store the beauty.
   - It iterates over the first half of the sorted array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements in pairs.
   - Finally, it prints the calculated beauty.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where all elements are the same (e.g., the second test case with all 69s), correctly outputting 0.
   - The code handles the case where the array length is 2, correctly outputting the difference between the two elements.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The sorting step has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient for the given constraints \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting and pairing the largest and smallest elements. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
