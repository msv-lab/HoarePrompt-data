Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the program attempts to compare each element in the list `nums` to the last element and accumulates a difference in `curr`. However, this approach does not consider the problem's requirement that the sum of the elements is divisible by `n` and that water can only be poured from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to check if it is possible to redistribute the water such that all containers have the same amount of water. This is possible if and only if the maximum amount of water in any container does not exceed the average amount of water that each container should have after redistribution. Here is a correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Calculate the average amount of water each container should have
        avg = sum(nums) // n
        
        # Check if any container has more water than the average
        if max(nums) > avg:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

# Example usage
# func()
```

This implementation correctly checks if the maximum amount of water in any container exceeds the average amount. If it does, it is impossible to redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount, and the program outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES".
