The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least 2 elements, `last` is the last element of `nums`, and `i` is the second element of `nums`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `nums` must be considered. Since `i` is the second element of `nums` at the end of the last iteration, the next iteration will use the third element of `nums` as `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least 3 elements, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `i` is the third element of `nums`. If `i` is not 0, `curr` is set to `2 * (i - last)`. Otherwise, `curr` remains 0.**
