The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `nums`. If `nums` has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute again for the second element.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least 1 element, `last` is the last element of `nums`, and `i` is the first element of `nums`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nums` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` will be the second element of `nums`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least 2 elements, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `i` is the second element of `nums`. If `i` is not 0, `curr` is set to `i - last`. Otherwise, `curr` remains 0.**
