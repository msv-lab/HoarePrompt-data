The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `nums`. For the loop to execute, `nums` must contain at least one element. The variable `i` will take the value of the first element in `nums` during the first iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 1 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the loop head)
- `n` is an input integer (not relevant to the loop head)
- `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input
- `last` is the last element of the `nums` list (not relevant to the loop head)
- `curr` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)

To ensure the loop executes, `nums` must have at least one element, and `i` will be the first element of `nums`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least one element, `last` is the last element of the `nums` list, `curr` is 0, `i` is the first element of `nums`**
