The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `nums`. The loop iterates over the elements of `nums`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the list `nums` must have at least one more element beyond the current one. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first element in `nums`, and `nums` had at least 1 element.

For the loop to execute again, `i` will be the next element in `nums`. Since `i` was the first element, the next element will be the second element in `nums`. The list `nums` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least 2 elements, `last` is the last element of the `nums` list, `i` is the second element in `nums`. If `i` is not 0, `curr` is set to `i - last`. If `i` is 0, `curr` remains 0.**
