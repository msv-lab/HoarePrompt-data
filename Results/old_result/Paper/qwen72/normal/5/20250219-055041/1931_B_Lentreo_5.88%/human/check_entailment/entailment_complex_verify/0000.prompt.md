You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of a_i is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: `t` is 0, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `last` is the last element of the `nums` list, and `curr` is the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element of `nums`. If `curr` is 0, the program prints 'YES'. If `curr` is not 0, the program prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums` from user input. It then checks if the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element of `nums` is zero. If this sum is zero, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state is that `t` is 0, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is the last input integer, `nums` is the last list of integers provided by the user, `last` is the last element of the last `nums` list, and `curr` is the sum of the differences calculated for the last `nums` list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
2
3
1 2 3
5
4 5 2 1 3
```

For the first test case:
- `n = 3`
- `nums = [1, 2, 3]`
- The program will set `last = 3` and `curr = 0`.
- It will then iterate through `nums`:
  - For `i = 1`, `curr += 1 - 3 = -2`
  - For `i = 2`, `curr += 2 - 3 = -1`
  - For `i = 3`, `curr += 3 - 3 = 0`
- The final value of `curr` will be `-3`, which is not `0`, so the program will print `NO`.

However, the correct answer should be `YES` because the sum of the elements is `6`, which is divisible by `3`, and we can make all elements equal to `2` by pouring `1` unit from the third container to the first container.

For the second test case:
- `n = 5`
- `nums = [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]`
- The program will set `last = 3` and `curr = 0`.
- It will then iterate through `nums`:
  - For `i = 4`, `curr += 4 - 3 = 1`
  - For `i = 5`, `curr += 5 - 3 = 2`
  - For `i = 2`, `curr += 2 - 3 = -1`
  - For `i = 1`, `curr += 1 - 3 = -2`
  - For `i = 3`, `curr += 3 - 3 = 0`
- The final value of `curr` will be `0`, so the program will print `YES`.

However, the correct answer should be `YES` because the sum of the elements is `15`, which is divisible by `5`, and we can make all elements equal to `3` by performing the operations as described in the problem statement.

The program incorrectly checks if the difference between each element and the last element sums to zero, which is not the correct approach to determine if all elements can be made equal. The correct approach would be to check if the sum of the elements is divisible by `n` and if the elements can be redistributed to make all elements equal to the average value. The provided program does not handle this logic correctly.
