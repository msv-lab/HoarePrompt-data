Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is a placeholder (not used).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
   - `last` is the last element of the `nums` list.
   - `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for all non-zero elements `i` in `nums`.
   - The current value of `curr` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
   - The value of `curr` is explicitly stated to be 0, but this does not affect the `print` statement.
   - The other variables (`t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`) are mentioned in the initial state but are not used in the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
