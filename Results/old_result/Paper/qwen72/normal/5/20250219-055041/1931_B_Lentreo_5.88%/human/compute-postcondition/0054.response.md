Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least two elements, `last` is the last element of the `nums` list, `i` is the second element of `nums`. If `i` is not 0, `curr` is updated to `i - last` plus its previous value. If `i` is 0, `curr` remains 0.***
