Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `last` is the last element of the new `nums` list, `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for all non-zero elements `i` in the new `nums` list. If `curr` is 0, the condition `curr == 0` holds true. Otherwise, `curr` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` updates the `nums` list with a new list of integers provided by the user input.
- The value of `t` remains greater than 0.
- The value of `_` remains a placeholder and is not used.
- The value of `n` remains an input integer.
- The value of `last` is now the last element of the new `nums` list.
- The value of `curr` is now the sum of `(i - last)` for all non-zero elements `i` in the new `nums` list.
- The condition `curr == 0` is still checked based on the new value of `curr`. If `curr` is 0, the condition holds true; otherwise, it does not.
