The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 30, `c` is an integer, `i` is 1, and `d` is equal to `c / 2`. If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, the condition `a * b < a * d` holds true. Otherwise, `a * b` is greater than or equal to `a * d`.**
