You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It then calculates `d` as half of `c`. If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, it prints `a * b`; otherwise, it prints the rounded value of `a * d`. After processing all `n` test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that `n` test cases have been processed, with the appropriate values printed for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `n`, from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Variable Assignment:**
   - The program assigns `d` as `c / 2`. This is intended to represent the cost of one yogurt if bought under the promotion (since the promotion price is for two yogurts).

3. **Cost Comparison:**
   - The program then compares `a * b` with `a * d`:
     - `a * b` is the cost of buying `a` yogurts at the regular price.
     - `a * d` is the cost of buying `a` yogurts at the promotion price (if `d` is the cost of one yogurt under the promotion).

4. **Output:**
   - If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, it prints `a * b`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`.

### Issues:
1. **Variable Misnaming:**
   - The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are misnamed. According to the problem description, `n` should be the number of yogurts, `a` should be the price of one yogurt, and `b` should be the promotion price for two yogurts. However, in the program, `a` is used as the number of yogurts, `b` is used as the price of one yogurt, and `c` is used as the promotion price for two yogurts.
   - This misnaming leads to incorrect logic in the cost comparison.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is the correct way to find the cost of one yogurt under the promotion.
   - However, the comparison `a * b < a * d` is incorrect because `a` should be the number of yogurts, not the price of one yogurt.
   - The correct comparison should be between the total cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price and the total cost of buying `n` yogurts at the promotion price.

3. **Rounding Issue:**
   - The program uses `round(a * d)`, which is not necessary. The cost should be an integer, and the correct approach is to use the minimum of the two calculated costs.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price
        regular_cost = n * a
        # Calculate the cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price
        promotion_cost = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        # Print the minimum of the two costs
        print(min(regular_cost, promotion_cost))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Regular Cost Calculation:**
  - `regular_cost = n * a` calculates the total cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
- **Promotion Cost Calculation:**
  - `(n // 2) * b` calculates the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price.
  - `(n % 2) * a` calculates the cost of buying any remaining yogurts at the regular price (if `n` is odd, there will be one yogurt left).
- **Minimum Cost:**
  - `print(min(regular_cost, promotion_cost))` prints the minimum of the two calculated costs.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to variable misnaming and incorrect cost comparison logic.

Correctness: **False**
