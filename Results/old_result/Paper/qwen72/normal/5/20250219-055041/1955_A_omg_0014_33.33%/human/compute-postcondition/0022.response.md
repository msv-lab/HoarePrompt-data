The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might be designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where `1 <= n <= 100` and `1 <= a, b <= 30`. The function is expected to return a result for each test case, but the specific output based on these inputs is not described in the given information.

Functionality: **The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with integers `n`, `a`, and `b` within specified ranges, and returns a result for each test case.**
