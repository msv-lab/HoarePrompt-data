Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 30, `c` is an integer, `i` is 1, and `d` is equal to `c / 2`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated from user input. If the new `a * b` is less than the new `a * d`, the condition `a * b < a * d` holds true. Otherwise, `a * b` is greater than or equal to `a * d`.***
