### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. However, the problem description specifies that the input should be `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case, not `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Variable Assignment**:
   - The program incorrectly assigns the input values to `a`, `b`, and `c`. According to the problem description, the input should be `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the promotion price for two yogurts.
   - The correct assignment should be `(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is incorrect. The variable `d` should represent the price of one yogurt when bought in pairs at the promotion price, which should be `b / 2`.
   - The condition `if a * b < a * d` is also incorrect. The program should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price (`n * a`) with the cost of buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price.
   - The correct logic should be:
     - Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought: `pairs = n // 2`.
     - Calculate the number of remaining yogurts: `remaining = n % 2`.
     - Calculate the total cost: `total_cost = pairs * b + remaining * a`.
     - Print `total_cost`.

4. **Example Test Case Analysis**:
   - **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - The program should output `9` because buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying them individually.
     - The program outputs `10` because it incorrectly calculates the cost.
   - **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - The program should output `14` because buying two yogurts at the promotion price and one at the regular price is cheaper.
     - The program outputs `15` because it incorrectly calculates the cost.
   - **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - The program should output `15` because buying three yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than buying two at the promotion price and one at the regular price.
     - The program outputs `15` by coincidence, but the logic is still incorrect.
   - **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - The program should output `20` because buying four yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than buying two pairs at the promotion price.
     - The program outputs `20` by coincidence, but the logic is still incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the problem description and fails to calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts in several test cases.

Final: **False**
