Reasoning:

1. **Parsing the Input**: The program correctly parses the dimensions of the field and initializes the `players`, `goals`, `mouvements`, and `quidditch` variables. It also correctly reads the initial state of the field and the actions.

2. **Movement Function**: The function `func_1` is intended to handle the movement of entities (players, Quaffle, Bludger) on the field. However, the function has a critical error: it attempts to unpack an integer `a` into `x` and `y`, which is incorrect. The function should unpack a tuple representing the current position of the entity and then apply the movement.

3. **Handling Movements**: The program correctly handles the movement of players and checks for collisions with the Bludger. However, due to the error in `func_1`, the movement logic is broken, and the program will not correctly update the positions of the players.

4. **Catching the Quaffle**: The program has a logical error in the `elif mo[1] == 'C':` block. The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` is a comparison, not an assignment. It should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to correctly assign the player who caught the Quaffle.

5. **Throwing the Quaffle**: The program correctly handles the scoring logic when a player throws the Quaffle into a goal. However, it has a logical error in the `elif mo[1] == 'T':` block. The program does not correctly reset the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a valid goal is scored. It only updates the Quaffle's position to the middle if the player is from the wrong team.

6. **Elimination Logic**: The program correctly handles the elimination of players when they are on the same cell as the Bludger. However, the logic for checking collisions with the Bludger is flawed because of the error in `func_1`.

7. **Final Score**: The program correctly prints the final score at the end of the game.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect due to the errors in `func_1` and the logical errors in handling the catching and throwing of the Quaffle.

Correctness: **False**
