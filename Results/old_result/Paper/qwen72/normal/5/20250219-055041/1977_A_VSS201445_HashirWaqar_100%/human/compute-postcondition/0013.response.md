The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `n` and `m`.

Given the initial state:
- `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `_` is 2.
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is an even number, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.

After executing the code:
- `n` and `m` are now specific integers provided by the user input.
- The condition about `n` and `m` (whether `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is an even number) is still valid but needs to be re-evaluated with the new values of `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user input, `_` is 2, if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is an even number, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.**
