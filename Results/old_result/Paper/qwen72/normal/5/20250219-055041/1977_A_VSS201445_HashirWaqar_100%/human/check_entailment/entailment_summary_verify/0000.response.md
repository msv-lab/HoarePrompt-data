Reasoning:

The original assessment claims that the program does not handle the case where `n` is less than `m` correctly. However, this claim is based on a misunderstanding of the problem constraints and the logic of the program.

1. **Problem Constraints**:
   - Nikita can only perform one of two actions in each move: add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
   - The initial tower has 0 cubes.
   - After `n` moves, the tower must have exactly `m` cubes.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program checks if `n >= m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: `n >= m`**:
     - If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it is possible to build a tower with `m` cubes if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This is because each move can either add or remove 1 cube, and an even difference means that the number of additions and removals can be balanced to achieve the desired height `m`.
     - For example, if `n = 3` and `m = 3`, Nikita can add 1 cube three times to achieve a tower of 3 cubes.
   - **Case 2: `n < m`**:
     - If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to build a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is `n`, which is less than `m`.
     - For example, if `n = 2` and `m = 3`, Nikita can only add up to 2 cubes, which is insufficient to reach a height of 3 cubes.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary correctly states that the function prints 'YES' if `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, and 'NO' otherwise.
   - This logic aligns with the problem constraints and ensures that the program handles both cases correctly.

5. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment incorrectly suggests that the program should output "YES" for cases where `n < m` and `n` and `m` are both odd or both even.
   - This is not correct because, as explained, `n < m` always results in an impossible scenario regardless of the parity of `n` and `m`.

Given the above reasoning, the program's logic is correct and aligns with the problem description.

Final: **True**
