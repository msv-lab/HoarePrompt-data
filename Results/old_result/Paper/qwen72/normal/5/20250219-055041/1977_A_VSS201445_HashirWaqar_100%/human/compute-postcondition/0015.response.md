Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user input.
   - `_` is 2.
   - The condition is that if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is an even number, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'NO'`.
   - The initial state provides a condition, but the code snippet does not check this condition. It simply prints `'NO'` regardless of the values of `n` and `m`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the `print` statement is not conditional and always prints `'NO'`, the output will always be `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
