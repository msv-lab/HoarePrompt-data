### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube from the tower in each move.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

2. **Constraints:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 100.
   - Both `n` and `m` are between 1 and 100.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - After `n` moves, the number of cubes in the tower can be any integer from `0` to `n` (if all moves are adding cubes) or from `0` to `n` (if some moves are removing cubes).
   - The key is to check if `m` can be achieved by a combination of adding and removing cubes.
   - Each move can be either adding or removing a cube, so the difference between the number of cubes added and removed must be `m`.
   - The total number of moves `n` must be at least `m` (since you can't have more cubes than the number of moves).
   - The difference `n - m` must be even because each pair of moves (one add and one remove) cancels out, and the remaining moves must be all adds or all removes.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `n - m` is even.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

5. **Annotated Code Validation:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at key points:
     - The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
     - For each test case, `n` and `m` are read from input.
     - The condition `n >= m` ensures that it is possible to have at least `m` cubes after `n` moves.
     - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even, which is necessary for the parity to match.
   - The final state of the program is correctly described: the loop completes all iterations, and the correct output is printed for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves, and the program correctly prints "NO".
   - If `n - m` is odd, it is impossible to achieve exactly `m` cubes because the parity of the number of cubes would not match, and the program correctly prints "NO".

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - The conditions `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` are both necessary and sufficient to solve the problem.
   - The annotated code and the original assessment are consistent and accurate.
