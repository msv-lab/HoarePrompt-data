Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple or list containing two integers n and m, such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function should handle up to 100 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is an even number, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either `n` is less than `m` or the difference `(n - m)` is not divisible by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is an even number, the condition is met. Otherwise, either `n` is less than `m` or the difference `(n - m)` is not divisible by 2, and the condition remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user input, `_` is 2. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is an even number, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
