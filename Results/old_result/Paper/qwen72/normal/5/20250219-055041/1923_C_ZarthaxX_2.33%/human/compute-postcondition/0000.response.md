Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n`, and each query is a tuple `(l, r)` where `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
