The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be a positive integer such that `i < n + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `i` is 3, `ones[1]` is `ones[0] + (1 if nums[0] == 1 else 0)`, `sum[1]` is `sum[0] + nums[0] - 1`, `ones[2]` is `ones[1] + (1 if nums[1] == 1 else 0)`, `sum[2]` is `sum[1] + nums[1] - 1`**
