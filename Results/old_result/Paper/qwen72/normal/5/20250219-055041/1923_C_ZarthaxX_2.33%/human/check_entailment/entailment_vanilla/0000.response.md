### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `nums` of length `n`.

2. **Prefix Sum Arrays**:
   - The program initializes two prefix sum arrays: `ones` and `sum`.
   - `ones[i]` is used to store the number of 1s in the subarray `nums[0:i]`.
   - `sum[i]` is used to store the sum of the elements in the subarray `nums[0:i]` minus the number of elements in the subarray.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through the array `nums` to populate the `ones` and `sum` arrays.
   - `ones[i]` is updated by adding 1 if `nums[i-1]` is 1, otherwise adding 0.
   - `sum[i]` is updated by adding `nums[i-1] - 1`.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - If `l == r`, the subarray has only one element, and it is impossible to find a different array `b` that satisfies the conditions, so it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of 1s in the subarray `nums[l-1:r]` using `ones[r] - ones[l-1]`.
   - It also calculates the sum of the elements in the subarray `nums[l-1:r]` minus the number of elements in the subarray using `sum[r] - sum[l-1]`.

5. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if the subarray is good by verifying the condition:
     \[
     2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \le \text{sumInRange}
     \]
   - Simplifying the condition:
     \[
     2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} = \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1)
     \]
     \[
     \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \le \text{sumInRange}
     \]
   - This condition ensures that the sum of the elements in the subarray minus the number of elements is at least the number of 1s in the subarray plus the number of elements in the subarray.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' if the condition is satisfied, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The use of prefix sum arrays allows efficient calculation of the number of 1s and the modified sum for each query. The condition check is also correct and ensures that the subarray meets the criteria for being good.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
