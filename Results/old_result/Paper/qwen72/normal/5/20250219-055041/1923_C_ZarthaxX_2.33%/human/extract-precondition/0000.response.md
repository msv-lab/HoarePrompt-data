Precondition: **The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the array `c`, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves. The precondition for the function should be: `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of queries, and each query is a tuple `(l, r)` where `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
