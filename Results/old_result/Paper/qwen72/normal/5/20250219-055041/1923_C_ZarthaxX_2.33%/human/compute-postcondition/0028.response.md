Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n`, `nums` is a list of integers with length `n`, `ones` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i - 1`, `sum` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums[j] - 1` for all `j` from 0 to `i - 1`, `l` and `r` are input integers, `onesInRange` is the number of 1s in `nums` from index `l` to `r - 1`, `sumInRange` is the value of `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is less than or equal to `sumInRange`, the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is greater than `sumInRange`. `q` is now `q - 1` and must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, and `sum` remain unchanged.
- `l` and `r` are assigned the values of two integers input by the user.
- The condition and the calculation of `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` remain the same.
- `q` is decremented by 1, but it must still be greater than 0.
