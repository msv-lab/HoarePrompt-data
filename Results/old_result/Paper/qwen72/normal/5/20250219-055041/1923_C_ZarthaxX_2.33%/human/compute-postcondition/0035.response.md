Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5).
- `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5) and must be greater than 0.
- `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n`.
- `nums` is a list of integers with length `n`.
- `ones` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i - 1`.
- `sum` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums[j] - 1` for all `j` from 0 to `i - 1`.
- `l` and `r` are input integers.
- `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
- `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
- If `l == r`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
- Otherwise, if `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is less than or equal to `sumInRange`, the condition is satisfied.
- Otherwise, `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is greater than `sumInRange`.
- `q` is now `q - 1` and must be greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and conditions, but the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints a fixed string.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `l`, `r`, `onesInRange`, or `sumInRange`.

Output: **NO**
