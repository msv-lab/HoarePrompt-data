Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n`, `nums` is a list of integers with length `n`. `ones` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.** 

The list `ones` has been initialized to contain `n + 1` elements, all of which are zeros. The other variables (`n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`) remain unchanged.
