Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n`, `nums` is a list of integers with length `n`, `ones` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i - 1`, `sum` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums[j] - 1` for all `j` from 0 to `i - 1`, `l` and `r` are input integers, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `l == r`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is less than or equal to `sumInRange`, the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is greater than `sumInRange`. `q` is now `q - 1` and must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]` updates the value of `sumInRange` to be the difference between `sum[r]` and `sum[l - 1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The value of `sumInRange` is now `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, which is the cumulative sum of `nums[j] - 1` for all `j` from `l - 1` to `r - 1`.
- The conditions for `l == r`, `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` being less than or equal to `sumInRange`, and `q` being greater than 0 are still valid and unchanged.
