You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the array `c`, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves. The precondition for the function should be: `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of queries, and each query is a tuple `(l, r)` where `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 3 · 10^5.

    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n`, `nums` is a list of integers with length `n`, `ones` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i - 1`, `sum` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums[j] - 1` for all `j` from 0 to `i - 1`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of queries on a list of positive integers. It reads the length of the list `n` and the number of queries `q` from the input. It then reads the list of integers `nums` from the input. For each query `(l, r)`, it determines if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is met, where `onesInRange` is the count of 1s in the subarray `nums[l-1:r]` and `sumInRange` is the sum of `nums[j] - 1` for all `j` in the range `[l-1, r-1]`. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all queries, the function does not return any value, but the state of the program includes the original list `nums`, the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` (`ones`), and the cumulative sum of `nums[j] - 1` (`sum`).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `nums` and initializes two auxiliary arrays `ones` and `sum`.

2. **Auxiliary Arrays**:
   - The `ones` array is used to store the cumulative count of 1s in the array `nums`.
   - The `sum` array is used to store the cumulative sum of `nums[i] - 1` for each index `i`.

3. **Preprocessing**:
   - The program correctly updates the `ones` array by adding 1 to the previous count if the current element is 1.
   - The `sum` array is updated by adding `nums[i - 1] - 1` to the previous sum. This is because the sum of `b` should be equal to the sum of `a`, and `b_i` must be positive and different from `a_i`.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program checks if the subarray `c[l_i, r_i]` is good.
   - If `l == r`, the subarray has only one element, and it cannot be good because there is no way to find a different positive integer `b_i` that satisfies the conditions.
   - The program calculates the number of 1s in the subarray using `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
   - It also calculates the sum of `nums[i] - 1` for the subarray using `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.

5. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`.
   - This condition ensures that the sum of `b` can be made equal to the sum of `a` by changing each `a_i` to a different positive integer `b_i` such that `b_i > 0` and `a_i != b_i`.
   - The term `2 * onesInRange` accounts for the fact that each 1 in `a` needs to be changed to at least 2 in `b` to ensure `b_i > 0` and `a_i != b_i`.
   - The term `(r - l + 1) - onesInRange` accounts for the remaining elements in the subarray that are not 1s. Each of these elements can be changed to a different positive integer that is not equal to itself.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints `YES` if the subarray is good and `NO` otherwise.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The preprocessing and query handling are efficient and handle the constraints appropriately.
