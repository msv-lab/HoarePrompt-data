The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the variable `q`. The loop will execute `q` times, and for the loop to execute at least once, `q` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is not used in the loop body, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n`, `nums` is a list of integers with length `n`, `ones` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i - 1`, `sum` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums[j] - 1` for all `j` from 0 to `i - 1`**
