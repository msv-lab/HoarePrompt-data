Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the last element in the list `nums`, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for `cnt`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.***
