Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `res` is 0, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value of `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The code calculates `total_sum` by summing all values in the dictionary `num_of_lens` except for the value of `cnt`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, and `res` remain unchanged.
- `total_sum` is now the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` that are not equal to `cnt`.
