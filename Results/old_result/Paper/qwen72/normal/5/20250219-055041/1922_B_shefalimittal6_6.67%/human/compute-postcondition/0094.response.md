Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the last element in the list `nums`, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by the combination of `cnt` taken 2 at a time multiplied by `total_sum`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.***
