Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    num_of_lens = {}
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for x in nums:
        num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1
    res = 0
    for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
        if cnt >= 3:
            res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
        if cnt >= 2:
            total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
            res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with key-value pairs representing the counts of integers in `nums`, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is the sum of all combinations of 3 and 2 for each count in `num_of_lens` values, where combinations of 3 are added directly to `res` if the count is 3 or more, and combinations of 2 are multiplied by the sum of all other counts and added to `res` if the count is 2 or more.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the same key-value pairs as in the initial state, and `res` is the sum of all combinations of counts taken 3 at a time for counts greater than or equal to 3, plus the sum of all combinations of counts taken 2 at a time for counts greater than or equal to 2, multiplied by the sum of all other counts in `num_of_lens` except for the current count.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least as many key-value pairs as the number of iterations the loop executed, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the last element in the list `nums`, `res` is the sum of all combinations of counts taken 3 at a time for counts that are at least 3, plus the sum of all combinations of counts taken 2 at a time for counts that are at least 2, each multiplied by the sum of all other counts in `num_of_lens`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
