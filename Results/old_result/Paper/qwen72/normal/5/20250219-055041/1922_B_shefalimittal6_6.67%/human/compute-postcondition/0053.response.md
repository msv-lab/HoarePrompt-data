Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is `res` + `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value of `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is updated by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to its current value.
- `math.comb(cnt, 2)` calculates the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 2 at a time.
- `total_sum` is the sum of all values in the dictionary `num_of_lens` except for the value associated with the key `cnt`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `num_of_lens` remain unchanged.
- The value of `total_sum` is still the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value of `cnt`.
