Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `nums` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `nums`, `res` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop executed, `x` is the last element in the list `nums`.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the last element in the list `nums`, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for `cnt`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the last element in the list `nums`, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by the combination of `cnt` taken 2 at a time multiplied by `total_sum`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the last element in the list `nums`, `cnt` is the third value in `num_of_lens`, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current `cnt` and the second value. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `res + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
