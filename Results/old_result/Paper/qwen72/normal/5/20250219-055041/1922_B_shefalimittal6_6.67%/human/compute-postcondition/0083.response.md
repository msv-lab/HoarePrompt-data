Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is `res + math.comb(cnt, 3)`, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last element in the list `nums`, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens` and the current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is updated by adding the result of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to its current value. The `math.comb(cnt, 3)` function calculates the number of ways to choose 3 items from `cnt` items without repetition and without order. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
