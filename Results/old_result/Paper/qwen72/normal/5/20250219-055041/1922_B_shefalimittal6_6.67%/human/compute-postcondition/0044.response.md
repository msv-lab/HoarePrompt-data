Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is now `num_of_lens[x] + 1` (where `num_of_lens[x]` was the previous value of `x` in `num_of_lens`), `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least three integers, `x` is the third integer in the list `nums`, `res` is the sum of all combinations of 3 and 2 for each count in `num_of_lens` values.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `num_of_lens[x]` by incrementing it by 1.
- If `x` was not previously in `num_of_lens`, it is added with a value of 1.
- If `x` was already in `num_of_lens`, its value is incremented by 1.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `nums`, and `res` remain unchanged.
- The value of `x` remains the third integer in the list `nums`.
