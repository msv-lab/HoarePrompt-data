Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `nums` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `nums`, `res` is the sum of all combinations of 3 and 2 for each count in `num_of_lens` values, where combinations of 3 are added directly to `res` if the count is 3 or more, and combinations of 2 are multiplied by the sum of all other counts and added to `res` if the count is 2 or more.**

In natural language, this means:
- `t` has been decremented by the number of iterations, and it is now either 0 or a positive integer.
- `n` remains the same input integer as it was initially.
- `num_of_lens` is now a dictionary that contains the frequency of each integer in the list `nums`.
- `res` has been updated to include the sum of all combinations of 3 and 2 for each count in `num_of_lens` values. If a count is 3 or more, the number of combinations of 3 is added directly to `res`. If a count is 2 or more, the number of combinations of 2 is multiplied by the sum of all other counts and added to `res`.
