The code snippet `res = 0` initializes the variable `res` to 0, overriding any previous value it might have had. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `nums` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `nums`, `res` is 0.**
