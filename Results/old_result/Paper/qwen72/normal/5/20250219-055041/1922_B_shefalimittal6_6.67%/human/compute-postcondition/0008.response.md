Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 2, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list `nums`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 1.
- The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1` increments the value associated with the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1.
- Since `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens` with a value of 1, the new value of `num_of_lens[x]` becomes 2.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged.
- The value of `x` is still the second integer in the list `nums`.
