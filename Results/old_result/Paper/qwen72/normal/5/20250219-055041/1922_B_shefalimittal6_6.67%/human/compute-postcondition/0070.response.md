Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the same key-value pairs as in the initial state, and `res` is the sum of all combinations of counts taken 3 at a time for counts greater than or equal to 3, plus the sum of all combinations of counts taken 2 at a time for counts greater than or equal to 2, multiplied by the sum of all other counts in `num_of_lens` except for the current count.**

In natural language: The value of `n` is updated to an integer input by the user. The values of `t`, `num_of_lens`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial state.
