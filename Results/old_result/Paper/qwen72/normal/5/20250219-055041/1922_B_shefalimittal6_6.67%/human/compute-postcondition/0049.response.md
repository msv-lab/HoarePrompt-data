Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is increased by the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**

The value of `res` is updated by adding the result of the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time, which is calculated using the `math.comb` function. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.
