Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `cnt` is the value of the second entry in `num_of_lens`, `res` is the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` plus the previous value of `res` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3; otherwise, `res` remains 0, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`, `res` is now `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` updates the value of `res` by adding the result of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to its current value.
- `math.comb(cnt, 2)` calculates the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt` items, which is a specific value based on the value of `cnt`.
- `total_sum` is the sum of all values in the dictionary `num_of_lens` except for the value of `cnt`.
- The new value of `res` is the sum of its previous value and the product of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` and `total_sum`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `cnt`, and `total_sum`) remain unchanged.
