Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, and `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `num_of_lens = {}` reassigns `num_of_lens` to an empty dictionary, overriding any previous key-value pairs it might have had.
- The variables `t`, `n`, and `res` are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.
