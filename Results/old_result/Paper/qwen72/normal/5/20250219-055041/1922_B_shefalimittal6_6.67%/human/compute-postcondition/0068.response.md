To determine what will be printed by the `print(res)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the keys are some values and the values are counts.
   - `res` is the sum of all combinations of counts taken 3 at a time for counts greater than or equal to 3, plus the sum of all combinations of counts taken 2 at a time for counts greater than or equal to 2, multiplied by the sum of all other counts in `num_of_lens` except for the current count.

2. **Computation of `res`:**
   - For each count in `num_of_lens` that is greater than or equal to 3, calculate the number of combinations of that count taken 3 at a time.
   - For each count in `num_of_lens` that is greater than or equal to 2, calculate the number of combinations of that count taken 2 at a time.
   - For each count that is used in the combinations of 2, multiply the result by the sum of all other counts in `num_of_lens` except for the current count.
   - Sum all these results to get `res`.

3. **Understanding the Combinations:**
   - The number of combinations of a count `c` taken 3 at a time is given by the binomial coefficient \( \binom{c}{3} = \frac{c!}{3!(c-3)!} \).
   - The number of combinations of a count `c` taken 2 at a time is given by the binomial coefficient \( \binom{c}{2} = \frac{c!}{2!(c-2)!} \).

4. **Summing the Combinations:**
   - For each count `c` in `num_of_lens`:
     - If `c` is greater than or equal to 3, add \( \binom{c}{3} \) to `res`.
     - If `c` is greater than or equal to 2, add \( \binom{c}{2} \) multiplied by the sum of all other counts in `num_of_lens` to `res`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `res` will be the sum of all these calculated combinations and multiplications.

Since the exact values of the counts in `num_of_lens` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `res`.

Output: **res (where res is the sum of all combinations of counts taken 3 at a time for counts greater than or equal to 3, plus the sum of all combinations of counts taken 2 at a time for counts greater than or equal to 2, multiplied by the sum of all other counts in `num_of_lens` except for the current count)**
