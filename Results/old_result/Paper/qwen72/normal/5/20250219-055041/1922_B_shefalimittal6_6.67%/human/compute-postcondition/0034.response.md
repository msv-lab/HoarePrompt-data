To determine what will be printed by the `print(res)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with key-value pairs representing the counts of integers in `nums`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `res` is the sum of all combinations of 3 and 2 for each count in `num_of_lens` values.

2. **Logic for Calculating `res`:**
   - For each count in `num_of_lens` values:
     - If the count is 3 or more, add the number of combinations of 3 directly to `res`.
     - If the count is 2 or more, multiply the number of combinations of 2 by the sum of all other counts and add the result to `res`.

3. **Understanding the Combinations:**
   - The number of combinations of 3 from a count `k` is given by the binomial coefficient \( \binom{k}{3} = \frac{k(k-1)(k-2)}{6} \).
   - The number of combinations of 2 from a count `k` is given by the binomial coefficient \( \binom{k}{2} = \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \).

4. **Sum of All Other Counts:**
   - For each count `k` in `num_of_lens` values, the sum of all other counts is the total sum of all counts in `num_of_lens` minus `k`.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - For each count `k` in `num_of_lens`:
     - If `k >= 3`, add \( \frac{k(k-1)(k-2)}{6} \) to `res`.
     - If `k >= 2`, add \( \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \times (\text{sum of all other counts}) \) to `res`.

Since the exact values of `nums` and `num_of_lens` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the given logic, we can describe the value of `res` in terms of the provided information.

Output: **res (where res is the sum of all combinations of 3 and 2 for each count in num_of_lens values, with combinations of 3 added directly if the count is 3 or more, and combinations of 2 multiplied by the sum of all other counts and added if the count is 2 or more)**
