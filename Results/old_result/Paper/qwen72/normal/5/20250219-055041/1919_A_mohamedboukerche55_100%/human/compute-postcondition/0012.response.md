Output State: **`a` is the integer value of the first word in the new input string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in the initial input string `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 1, `s` is the new input string.**

The value of `a` is updated to the integer value of the first word in the new input string `s`. The value of `b` remains the integer value of the second word in the initial input string `s`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and `s` is the new input string.
