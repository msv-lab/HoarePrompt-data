You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Output

    Bob
    Alice

    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters, so it should be revised to include them.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: `a` is the integer value of the first word in the last input string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in the last input string `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is `t-1`, `s` is the last input string. If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, the program prints 'Bob'. If `(a + b) % 2 != 0`, the program prints 'Alice'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it reads a string `s` from the input, splits it into two integers `a` and `b`, and checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'; if the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly determines the winner based on the parity (odd or even) of the sum of the coins in both wallets. However, the game's outcome depends on the number of coins and the sequence of moves, not just the parity of the sum.

A counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness:

Input:
```
1
2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
Alice
```

Actual Output from the program:
```
Bob
```

In this case, Alice can win by following these steps:
1. Alice swaps wallets with Bob. Now, Alice has 1 coin and Bob has 2 coins.
2. Bob cannot swap wallets (since it would just return the wallets to their original state) and must remove a coin. Now, Alice has 1 coin and Bob has 1 coin.
3. Alice removes a coin. Now, Alice has 0 coins and Bob has 1 coin.
4. Bob cannot make a move because Alice's wallet is empty. Therefore, Alice wins.

The program incorrectly outputs "Bob" for this case, demonstrating that it does not correctly handle the game logic.
