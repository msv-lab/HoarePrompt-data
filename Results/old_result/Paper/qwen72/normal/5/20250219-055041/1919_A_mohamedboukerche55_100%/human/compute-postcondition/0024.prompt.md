Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The number of test cases, t, is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    a = int(list(s.split())[0])
    b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is the integer value of the first word in the input string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in the input string `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 0, `s` is an input string. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the program follows the postcondition of the if part. If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the program follows the postcondition of the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is the integer value of the first word in the new input string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in the new input string `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 1, `s` is the new input string. If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, then no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is the integer value of the first word in the new input string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in the new input string `s`, `t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 2, `s` is the new input string. If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, the values of `a`, `b`, `t`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged. If `(a + b) % 2 != 0`, the values of `a`, `b`, `t`, `i`, and `s` also remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
