Output State: **`a` is the integer value of the first word in the new input string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in the new input string `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 1, `s` is the new input string.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `b` to the integer value of the second word in the new input string `s`. The value of `a` remains the integer value of the first word in the new input string `s`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The new input string `s` is still the same as it was in the initial state.
