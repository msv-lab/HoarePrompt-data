Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is the integer value of the first word in the input string `s`.
   - `b` is the integer value of the second word in the input string `s`.
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - The sum of `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('Alice')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Alice'`.
   - The values of `a`, `b`, `t`, `i`, and `s` are not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - The condition that the sum of `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2 is given but does not affect the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is printing a fixed string, the output will be:

Output: **Alice**
