Postcondition: ***`a` is the integer value of the first word in the new input string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in the new input string `s`, `t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 2, `s` is the new input string. If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, the values of `a`, `b`, `t`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged. If `(a + b) % 2 != 0`, the values of `a`, `b`, `t`, `i`, and `s` also remain unchanged.***
