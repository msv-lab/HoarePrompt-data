The only objects in the loop head are the variables `q` and `e`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `e`. If `e` has at least two characters, the loop can execute again for the second character.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `s` is an input integer greater than 0, `e` is an input string that must have at least one character, and `q` is the first character of `e`. For the loop to execute one more time, `e` must have at least two characters, and `q` will be the second character of `e`.

State: **`i` is 0, `s` is an input integer greater than 0, `e` is an input string that must have at least 2 characters, `q` is the second character of `e`. If `q` is equal to '+', `P` is 1 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 1.**
