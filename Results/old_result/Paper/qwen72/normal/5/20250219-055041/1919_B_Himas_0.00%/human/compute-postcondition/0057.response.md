The only objects in the loop head are the variables `q` and the string `e`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `e`. If `e` has at least 3 characters, the loop will execute one more time with `q` being the third character of `e`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `s` is a new input integer greater than 1, `e` is a new input string that must have at least 2 characters, and `q` is the second character of `e`. For the loop to execute one more time, `e` must have at least 3 characters, and `q` will be the third character of `e`.

State: **`i` is 2, `s` is a new input integer greater than 1, `e` is a new input string that must have at least 3 characters, `q` is the third character of `e`. If `q` is equal to '+', `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not equal to '+', `P` is 0 and `M` is 2.**
