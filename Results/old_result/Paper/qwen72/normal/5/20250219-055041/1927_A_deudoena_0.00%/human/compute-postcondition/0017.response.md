Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' character, `inpstr` is a string, `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the characters in `inpstr` using the `enumerate` function, which provides both the index `i` and the character `j` at each step.
- The loop checks if the current character `j` is 'B'. If it is, `ind1` is updated to the current index `i`, and the loop breaks, stopping further iterations.
- If 'B' is not found within the first few characters, the loop continues until it finds the first 'B'.
- After the loop completes (either by finding the first 'B' or by iterating through the entire string if no 'B' is found), `ind1` will hold the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`.
- The variables `ind2` and `outind` remain unchanged at 0, as they are not modified within the loop.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged because they are not involved in the loop's head or body.
