Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' character, `inpstr` must be a non-empty string, `ind1` is 1, `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is the second character of `inpstr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `j` is 'B'. Otherwise, the values of `ind1`, `ind2`, `outind`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
