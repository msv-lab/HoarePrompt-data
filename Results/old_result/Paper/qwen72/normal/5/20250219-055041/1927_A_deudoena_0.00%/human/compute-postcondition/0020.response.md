Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' character, `inpstr` is a string that must have at least one character, `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0, `i` is 0, and the character at the position `len(inpstr) - i - 1` in `inpstr` is 'B', `ind2` is now equal to `i`.**

In natural language: The value of `ind2` is now equal to the value of `i`, which is 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
