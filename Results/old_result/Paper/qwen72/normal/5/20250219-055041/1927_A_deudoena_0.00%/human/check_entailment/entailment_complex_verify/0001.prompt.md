You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' character.
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' character, `inpstr` is a string, `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0.
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' character, `inpstr` is a string, `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr` if 'B' is found, otherwise `ind2` remains 0, `outind` is 0, `i` is the index of the last character in `inpstr` if 'B' is not found, otherwise it is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`.
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
    #This is printed: len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 (where ind1 is the index of the first 'B' in inpstr, ind2 is the index of the last 'B' in inpstr if 'B' is found, otherwise ind2 is 0, and len(inpstr) is the length of the string inpstr)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads a string `inpstr` from user input, which is expected to contain characters 'W' or 'B' and at least one 'B' character. After processing, it prints the difference between the length of the string and the sum of the indices of the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string. If 'B' is not found in the string, the function will print the length of the string minus the index of the first occurrence of 'B'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program does not handle the input as specified in the problem description. The problem states that there are multiple test cases, but the program only reads a single string input and processes it. It lacks a loop to handle multiple test cases.

2. **Identifying the Segment**: The program attempts to find the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white by identifying the first and last positions of black cells ('B') in the string. This is a reasonable approach because the minimum segment to paint will be from the first black cell to the last black cell.

3. **Finding the First Black Cell**:
   - The program uses a `for` loop with `enumerate` to find the index of the first black cell ('B') and stores it in `ind1`.
   - This is correct and efficient.

4. **Finding the Last Black Cell**:
   - The program uses another `for` loop to find the index of the last black cell ('B') from the end of the string and stores it in `ind2`.
   - This is also correct, but it could be more efficient by breaking the loop as soon as the last black cell is found.

5. **Calculating the Length**:
   - The program calculates the length of the segment to be painted as `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`.
   - This calculation is incorrect. The correct length should be `ind2 + ind1 + 1` because `ind1` and `ind2` are zero-based indices, and the segment length includes both the first and last black cells.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated length for each test case.
   - However, it only processes one test case, which is not sufficient according to the problem description.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases and the segment length calculation is wrong.
