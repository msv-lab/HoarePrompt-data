The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the length of `inpstr`. For the loop to execute, `inpstr` must have at least one character, and `i` must start at 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' character (not relevant to the loop head)
- `inpstr` is a string (relevant to the loop head)
- `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr` (not relevant to the loop head)
- `ind2` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `outind` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)

For the loop to execute, `inpstr` must have at least one character. The initial state does not specify the length of `inpstr`, so we need to ensure that `inpstr` has at least one character. The variable `i` is automatically set to 0 by the `range` function at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' character, `inpstr` is a string that must have at least one character, `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0, `i` is 0**
