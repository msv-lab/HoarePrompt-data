Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\).
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' character.
- `inpstr` is a string.
- `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`.
- `ind2` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr` if 'B' is found, otherwise `ind2` remains 0.
- `outind` is 0.
- `i` is the index of the last character in `inpstr` if 'B' is not found, otherwise it is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`ind1`**: This is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`. If 'B' is not found, `ind1` would be -1 (since `str.index()` raises a `ValueError` if the substring is not found, but we assume `ind1` is set to -1 in such cases).
2. **`ind2`**: This is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`. If 'B' is not found, `ind2` remains 0.
3. **`len(inpstr)`**: This is the length of the string `inpstr`.

### Calculation:
- If 'B' is found in `inpstr`:
  - `ind1` is the index of the first 'B'.
  - `ind2` is the index of the last 'B'.
  - The expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` calculates the difference between the length of the string and the sum of the indices of the first and last 'B' characters.

- If 'B' is not found in `inpstr`:
  - `ind1` is -1 (assuming it is set to -1 if 'B' is not found).
  - `ind2` remains 0.
  - The expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` becomes `len(inpstr) - 0 - (-1) = len(inpstr) + 1`.

### Final Output:
- If 'B' is found in `inpstr`, the output will be the length of `inpstr` minus the sum of the indices of the first and last 'B' characters.
- If 'B' is not found in `inpstr`, the output will be the length of `inpstr` plus 1.

Output: **len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 (where ind1 is the index of the first 'B' in inpstr, ind2 is the index of the last 'B' in inpstr if 'B' is found, otherwise ind2 is 0, and len(inpstr) is the length of the string inpstr)**
