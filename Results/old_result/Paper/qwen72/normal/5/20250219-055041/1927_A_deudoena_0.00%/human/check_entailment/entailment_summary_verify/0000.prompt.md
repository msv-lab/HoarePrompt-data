You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads a string `inpstr` from user input, which is expected to contain characters 'W' or 'B' and at least one 'B' character. After processing, it prints the difference between the length of the string and the sum of the indices of the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string. If 'B' is not found in the string, the function will print the length of the string minus the index of the first occurrence of 'B'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the input format as specified in the problem description. The problem description states that the input will consist of multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` followed by a string `s`. However, the program only reads a single string and does not account for the number of test cases or the integer `n` indicating the length of the strip. This means the program will fail to process the input correctly for multiple test cases.

Additionally, the logic in the program is flawed. It attempts to find the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string to determine the segment that needs to be painted. However, it does not correctly calculate the length of the segment that needs to be painted. For example, if the input string is "WBBWBW", the program will output `4`, which is correct, but if the input string is "BWWB", the program will output `2`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `3` because the segment from the 1st to the 3rd cell needs to be painted to cover all black cells.

To fix the program, it should read the number of test cases, process each test case correctly, and calculate the minimum segment length accurately.
