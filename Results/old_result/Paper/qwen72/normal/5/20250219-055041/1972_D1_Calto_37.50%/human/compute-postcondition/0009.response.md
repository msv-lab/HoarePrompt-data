The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `m` must be greater than 2 for the loop to have executed up to this point. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 3, and `m` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `m` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `cnt` is `n + (n - 2) // 4 + 1`, `x` is `n - 2`, `y` is 4**
