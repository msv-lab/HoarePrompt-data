The code snippet updates the value of `cnt` by adding the result of `x // y` and a boolean expression `(i > 1)` to its current value. Let's break down the impact:

- `x // y` is the integer division of `x` by `y`. Given `x` is `n` and `y` is 1, `x // y` is equal to `n`.
- `(i > 1)` evaluates to 0 because `i` is 1, and 1 is not greater than 1.
- `cnt` is incremented by `n + 0`, which is `n`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `m` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cnt` is `n`, `x` is `n`, `y` is 1.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `m` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cnt` is `n`, `x` is `n`, `y` is 1.**
