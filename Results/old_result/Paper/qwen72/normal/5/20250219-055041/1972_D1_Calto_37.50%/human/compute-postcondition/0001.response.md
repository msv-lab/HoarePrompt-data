The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `m`. For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 1, because the range function in Python generates a sequence starting from 1 up to, but not including, `m`. If `m` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute. The variable `i` will start at 1, which is the first value in the range.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6
- `cnt` is 0

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute:
- `m` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
- `i` will be 1 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `m` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 0**
