Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `m` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `cnt` is `n + (n - 2) // 4 + 1 + (n - 6) // 9 + 1`, `x` is `n - 6`, `y` is 9.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is updated to `cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`.
- `x // y` is `(n - 6) // 9`.
- Since `i` is 3, `(i > 1)` evaluates to `True`, which is equivalent to 1 in integer context.
- Therefore, the new value of `cnt` is `n + (n - 2) // 4 + 1 + (n - 6) // 9 + 1`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
