The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers, `n` and `m`, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. It returns 1 if the sum of a series of calculations based on `n` and `m-1` is zero. Otherwise, it returns the sum of these calculations, which is the sum of `n + (n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1)` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`. The final state of the program includes the unchanged values of `n` and `m`, and the computed value of `cnt` which is returned.
