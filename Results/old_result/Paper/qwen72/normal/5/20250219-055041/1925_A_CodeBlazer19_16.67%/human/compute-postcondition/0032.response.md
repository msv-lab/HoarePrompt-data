Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `s` is the string containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the English alphabet, `j` is `k` + 96. If `k` is 1, `k` remains 1. Otherwise, `k` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the user input, but the constraints on `n` and `k` (1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26) remain valid. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `s`, `j`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their initial states remain unchanged. If `k` is 1, it remains 1; otherwise, `k` is greater than 1.
