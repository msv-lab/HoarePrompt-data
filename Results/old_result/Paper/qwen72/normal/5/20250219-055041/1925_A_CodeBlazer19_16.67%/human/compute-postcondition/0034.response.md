The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `k`. The loop will execute based on the range defined by `97` to `k + 97`. For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0, and since `k` is a positive integer (1 <= `k` <= 26), the loop will always execute at least once. The initial value of `j` is not explicitly set in the state before the loop, but it will be set by the loop itself to start from 97.

Given that `k` is already a positive integer and `j` will be set by the loop, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, for clarity, we can state that `j` starts at 97 and `k` must be greater than 1 for the loop to iterate more than once.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `s` is an empty string, `j` starts at 97, `k` must be greater than 1**
