Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `s` is 'ab', `j` is 98, `k` must be greater than 1.**

The code snippet `s += chr(j)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`. Since `j` is 98, the character 'b' is appended to `s`, which was initially 'a'. Therefore, `s` becomes 'ab'. The values of `n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
