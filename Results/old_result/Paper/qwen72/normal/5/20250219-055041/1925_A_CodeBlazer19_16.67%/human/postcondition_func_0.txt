The function reads an integer `t` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user, where `1 <= n <= 26` and `1 <= k <= 26`. It then generates a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase letters of the English alphabet. If `k` is 1, it prints the string `s` repeated `n` times. Otherwise, it prints the string `s` repeated twice unless `n` is 1, in which case it prints `s` once. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.
