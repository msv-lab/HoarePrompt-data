Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the string 'ab' + 'c', `j` is 99.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s += chr(j)` appends the character represented by the ASCII value of `j` (which is 99, corresponding to the character 'c') to the string `s`. Therefore, `s` changes from 'ab' to 'abc'. The values of `n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
