Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1 and `x` is even, `x` is now `x // 2`, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing `[100000000]`, `t` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is now half of its original value (since `x` is even, the result is an integer). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
