The code `ans.append(min)` appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`.

- If `x` is even, `min` is `-100000000` and `ans` is `[100000000]`. After appending, `ans` becomes `[100000000, -100000000]`.
- If `x` is odd, `min` is `-99999999` and `ans` is `[-100000000]`. After appending, `ans` becomes `[-100000000, -99999999]`.

The values of `i`, `x`, `max`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even or 100000000 if `x` is odd, `min` is -100000000 if `x` is even or -99999999 if `x` is odd, `ans` is `[100000000, -100000000]` if `x` is even or `[-100000000, -99999999]` if `x` is odd, and `t` is 1.**
