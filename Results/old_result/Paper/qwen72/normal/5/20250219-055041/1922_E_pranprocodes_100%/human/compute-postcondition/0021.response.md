Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `max` is 100000000 or 99999999 depending on whether `x` is odd or even, `min` is -100000000 or -99999999 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, `ans` is a list containing 100000000 and -100000000 if `x` is even or -100000000 and -100000000 if `x` is odd, `t` is 1, `x` is updated to `x` divided by 2 if `x` is even or remains unchanged if `x` is odd.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The value of `x` remains an input integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, but it is updated to `x` divided by 2 if `x` is even, or remains unchanged if `x` is odd.
- The value of `max` remains 100000000 if `x` is even or 99999999 if `x` is odd.
- The value of `min` remains -100000000 if `x` is even or -99999999 if `x` is odd.
- The list `ans` is updated to include the value of `min`. If `x` is even, `ans` now contains [100000000, -100000000]. If `x` is odd, `ans` now contains [-100000000, -100000000].
- The value of `t` remains 1.
