Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000 + k, `ans` is a list containing alternating values of `max` and `min` starting with `max` and alternating with `min`, `t` is `k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `max` is updated to 100000000.
- The values of `i`, `x`, `min`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged.
- The list `ans` still contains alternating values of `max` and `min`, but now `max` is 100000000, and `min` is -100000000 + k.
- The list `ans` starts with `max` and alternates with `min`.
