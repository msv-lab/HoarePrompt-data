Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list, `t` is the total number of iterations it took for `x` to become 1.**

The code snippet `ans = []` initializes `ans` as an empty list, overriding the previous description of `ans` as a list containing a sequence of `max` values appended for each even `x` and `min` values appended for each odd `x`, but in reverse order. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `t`) remain unchanged.
