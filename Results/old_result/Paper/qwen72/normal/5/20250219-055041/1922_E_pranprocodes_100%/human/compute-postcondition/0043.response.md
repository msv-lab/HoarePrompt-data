Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list, `t` is `k`.**

The code snippet `ans = []` reassigns the variable `ans` to an empty list, overriding the previous list that contained alternating values of `max` and `min`. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `t`) remain unchanged.
