Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer divided by 2 (result is an integer), `max` is 99999997, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing 100000000, 99999999, and 99999998, and `t` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is divided by 2 and the result is an integer.
- The values of `i`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `max`, `min`, and `ans` are still valid based on the initial state.
