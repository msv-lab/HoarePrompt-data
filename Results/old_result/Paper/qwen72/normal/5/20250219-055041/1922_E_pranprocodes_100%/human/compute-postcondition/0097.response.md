Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1. If `x` is even, `x` is now `x // 2`, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing `[100000000, 99999999]`, and `t` is 1. If `x` is odd, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing `[-100000000, 100000000]`, and `t` is 1.**
