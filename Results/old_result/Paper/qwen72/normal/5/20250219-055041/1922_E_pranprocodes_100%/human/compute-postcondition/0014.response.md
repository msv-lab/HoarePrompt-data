Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `x` is an even integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing `-100000000`, `t` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `x` is initially an odd integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1.
- After executing `x -= 1`, `x` is decremented by 1, making it an even integer.
- The values of `i`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged.
