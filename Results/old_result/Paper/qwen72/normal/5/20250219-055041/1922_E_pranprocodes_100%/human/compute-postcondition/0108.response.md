Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `t` is 2, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is a list containing `[100000000, 99999999, -100000000]` if `x` is even; `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is `[-100000000, -99999999, -99999998]` if `x` is odd.**

The code `ans.append(min)` appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. If `x` is even, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` becomes `[100000000, 99999999, -100000000]`. If `x` is odd, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` becomes `[-100000000, -99999999, -99999998]`. The values of `i`, `x`, `t`, `max`, and `min` remain unchanged.
