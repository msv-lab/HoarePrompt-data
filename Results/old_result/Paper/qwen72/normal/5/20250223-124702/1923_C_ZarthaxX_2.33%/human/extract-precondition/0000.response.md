Precondition: **The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the array `c`, the number of test cases `t`, the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves. For example, the function might be defined as `def func_1(t, n, c, q, queries):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `c`, `c` is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries, and `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n.**
