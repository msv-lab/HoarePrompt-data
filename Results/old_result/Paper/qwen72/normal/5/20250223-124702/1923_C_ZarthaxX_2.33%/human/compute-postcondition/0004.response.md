The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, and `i` will start at 1. The other variables and objects (`nums`, `q`, `c`, `t`, `ones`, `sum`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `q` are integers, `c` is an array, `t` is the number of test cases, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is 1**
