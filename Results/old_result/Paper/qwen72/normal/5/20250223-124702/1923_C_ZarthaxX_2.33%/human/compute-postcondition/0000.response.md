Output State: **The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the array `c`, the number of test cases `t`, the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves. `n` and `q` are now integers, where `n` is the length of the array `c` and `q` is the number of queries.**
