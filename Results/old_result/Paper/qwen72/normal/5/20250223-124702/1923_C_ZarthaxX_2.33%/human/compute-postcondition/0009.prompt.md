You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the array `c`, the number of test cases `t`, the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves. For example, the function might be defined as `def func_1(t, n, c, q, queries):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `c`, `c` is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries, and `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
        
    #State: `ones` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the count of `1`s in the `nums` list from the start up to index `i-1`. `sum` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `nums` from the start up to index `i-1` and 1. The values of `nums`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `t` remain unchanged.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `ones` and `sum` remain unchanged, and the values of `nums`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `t` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t` (number of test cases), `n` (length of the array), `c` (a list of positive integers), `q` (number of queries), and `queries` (a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` representing query ranges). It returns the results of the queries based on the input array `c` and the specified ranges in `queries`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
