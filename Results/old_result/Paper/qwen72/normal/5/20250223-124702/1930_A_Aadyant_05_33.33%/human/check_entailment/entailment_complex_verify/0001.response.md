### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `num`, and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `a` which represents the number of pairs of integers to be processed.
   - It then reads a line of input containing `2a` integers and splits it into a list `list1`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The list `list1` is sorted in ascending order. Sorting is essential because it ensures that the smallest numbers are always chosen first, which maximizes the sum of the minimum values in each pair.

3. **Pair Selection:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted list, selecting every second element (i.e., the smaller number in each pair) and appending it to `list2`. This is done by the loop `for i in range(a): list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))`.
   - This approach is correct because, in a sorted list, the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are the smaller numbers of each pair.

4. **Summing and Storing Results:**
   - The sum of the elements in `list2` is calculated and appended to the `out` list, which stores the results for each test case.
   - This step is correct and ensures that the maximum possible score for each test case is stored.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints each result in the `out` list.
   - The output format matches the problem description, and the results are printed correctly.

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State:**
  - The function starts by reading the number of test cases, `num`.
  - `out` is initialized as an empty list to store the results of each test case.

- **Processing Each Test Case:**
  - `list2` and `list1` are initialized as empty lists for each test case.
  - `a` is read and converted to an integer, representing the number of pairs.
  - `b` is read and split into a list of integers, `list1`.
  - `list1` is sorted in ascending order.
  - The loop `for i in range(a): list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))` correctly selects the smaller number from each pair and appends it to `list2`.
  - The sum of `list2` is appended to `out`.

- **Final State:**
  - `out` contains the sums for each test case.
  - The loop `for outputs in out: print(outputs)` correctly prints each result.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately. It will produce the correct output for the given inputs. The original assessment is accurate in its reasoning and conclusion.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
