Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting and Pairing**:
   - The program sorts the list of integers.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list, selecting every second element (starting from the first) and adding it to a new list `list2`. This is because the minimum value in each pair of sorted elements will always be the first element of the pair.

3. **Summing the Minimum Values**:
   - The program sums the elements in `list2`, which contains the minimum values from each pair.
   - It appends the sum to the `out` list, which stores the results for each test case.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results stored in the `out` list.

The logic of the program is sound and follows the optimal strategy for maximizing the score by always selecting the smallest available number in each pair. This ensures that the sum of the minimum values is maximized.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the key parts of the code:

- **Reading Input**:
  ```python
  num = input()
  out = []
  for numbers in range(int(num)):
      list1 = []
      a = input()
      a = int(a)
      b = input('')
      list1 = b.split()
  ```

- **Sorting and Processing**:
  ```python
  list1.sort()
  list2 = []
  for i in range(a):
      list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))
  out.append(sum(list2))
  del list1[:]
  del list2[:]
  ```

- **Outputting Results**:
  ```python
  for outputs in out:
      print(outputs)
  ```

This approach ensures that the program correctly handles multiple test cases and produces the expected output for each case. Therefore, the program is correct.
