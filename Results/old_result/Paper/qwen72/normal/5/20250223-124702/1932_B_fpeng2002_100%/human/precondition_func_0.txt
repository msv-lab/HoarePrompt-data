The function should accept two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains the integer n followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Each a_i is a positive integer, and the constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
