Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input for `t` test cases, where each test case consists of `n`, `f`, and `k` integers, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the value at index `f-1` in the list `a` (referred to as the favorite value). It then counts how many values in `a` are equal to the favorite value and how many are greater than the favorite value. Based on these counts, it prints 'YES' if there are at least `k` values greater than the favorite value, 'NO' if the sum of values equal to and greater than the favorite value is less than or equal to `k`, and 'MAYBE' otherwise. The function does not return any values, but it prints the result for each test case. **
