Output State: **The loop will print the square of the side length of the square for each iteration, based on the coordinates provided in the input. The state of the variables `x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4, res` will be updated for each iteration, but their final values will depend on the last set of coordinates provided in the input. The variable `a` will remain unchanged.**
