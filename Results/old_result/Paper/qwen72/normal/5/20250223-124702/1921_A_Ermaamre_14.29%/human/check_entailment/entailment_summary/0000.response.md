Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by reading the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reading four pairs of coordinates. It then checks the conditions to determine the side length of the square and prints the area (side length squared).

However, the program has a few issues:
1. **Incorrect Assumption in Conditions**: The program assumes that the coordinates are given in a specific order, which is not guaranteed. The problem states that the coordinates are given in random order, and the program should be able to handle any permutation of the coordinates.
2. **Redundant Conditions**: The conditions in the program are not necessary and are overly specific. There are only a few valid configurations for the coordinates of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and the program should handle all of them.
3. **Missing General Solution**: The program does not provide a general solution that works for any permutation of the coordinates. Instead, it only checks a few specific cases, which may not cover all possible valid inputs.

A correct approach would be to:
1. Collect all the x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately.
2. Determine the unique x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
3. Calculate the side length of the square as the difference between the two unique x-coordinates (or y-coordinates, since the square's sides are parallel to the axes).
4. Compute the area of the square by squaring the side length.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
