Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program indeed does not handle all possible permutations of the input coordinates for the corners of the square. The program only checks three specific cases where the coordinates are in a particular order, but there are many other valid permutations that the program does not account for. For example, the input provided in the original assessment:
```
1
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
```
None of the `if` conditions will match, leading to an incorrect result. The program should be able to identify the side length of the square regardless of the order of the input coordinates. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
