Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `tests` number of times, each time processing a new set of inputs `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each test case, if `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, or if any character in `c` is not found in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`, the output will be 'YES'. Otherwise, the output will be 'NO'. The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `no` will be reset for each iteration, and `counter` will be used to track the position in the strings during each test case. After all iterations, `tests` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `tests` from the input, indicating the number of test cases to process. For each test case, it reads three inputs: an integer `slength`, and two strings `a` and `b` of length `slength`. It then reads another string `c` of the same length. The function checks if `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if any character in `c` is not present in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`. If such a character is found, it prints 'YES'. If no such character is found, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the variable `tests` remains unchanged, and the function concludes.
