You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `tests` from the input, indicating the number of test cases to process. For each test case, it reads three inputs: an integer `slength`, and two strings `a` and `b` of length `slength`. It then reads another string `c` of the same length. The function checks if `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if any character in `c` is not present in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`. If such a character is found, it prints 'YES'. If no such character is found, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the variable `tests` remains unchanged, and the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find a template \( t \) such that:
  - \( a \) and \( b \) match \( t \).
  - \( c \) does not match \( t \).
- A string \( s \) matches a template \( t \) if:
  - For each position \( i \), if \( t_i \) is lowercase, \( s_i \) must be the same as \( t_i \).
  - For each position \( i \), if \( t_i \) is uppercase, \( s_i \) must be different from the lowercase version of \( t_i \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the strings \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program checks if \( c \) is equal to either \( a \) or \( b \). If so, it immediately prints "NO" and sets `no` to `False`.
   - This check is correct because if \( c \) is exactly the same as \( a \) or \( b \), it is impossible to find a template \( t \) that matches \( a \) and \( b \) but not \( c \).

3. **Template Matching Check:**
   - The program initializes a counter and iterates over each character in \( c \).
   - It checks if the current character \( c_i \) is not in \( a_i \) and \( b_i \). If this condition is met, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop.
   - This check is incorrect because it only checks if \( c_i \) is different from \( a_i \) and \( b_i \), but it does not ensure that \( a_i \) and \( b_i \) are the same and can be matched by a lowercase template character, or that \( a_i \) and \( b_i \) are different and can be matched by an uppercase template character.

4. **Final Output:**
   - If the loop completes without finding a position where \( c_i \) is different from both \( a_i \) and \( b_i \), the program prints "NO".

### Correctness Issues:
- The program does not correctly handle the conditions for matching the template \( t \):
  - It should ensure that for each position \( i \), \( a_i \) and \( b_i \) are either the same (and can be matched by a lowercase template character) or different (and can be matched by an uppercase template character).
  - It should also ensure that \( c_i \) does not match the template \( t \) in any position.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Ensure that for each position \( i \), \( a_i \) and \( b_i \) are either the same (and can be matched by a lowercase template character) or different (and can be matched by an uppercase template character).
2. Ensure that \( c_i \) does not match the template \( t \) in any position.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for _ in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        
        # Check if there exists a template t such that a and b match it, but c does not
        can_match = True
        for i in range(slength):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                # a and b match a lowercase template character
                if c[i] == a[i]:
                    can_match = False
                    break
            else:
                # a and b match an uppercase template character
                if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                    can_match = False
                    break
        
        if can_match:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Explanation:
- For each position \( i \):
  - If \( a_i \) and \( b_i \) are the same, the template \( t_i \) must be the same lowercase character. If \( c_i \) is also the same, then \( c \) matches the template, and we set `can_match` to `False`.
  - If \( a_i \) and \( b_i \) are different, the template \( t_i \) must be an uppercase character. If \( c_i \) is either \( a_i \) or \( b_i \), then \( c \) matches the template, and we set `can_match` to `False`.
- If `can_match` remains `True` after checking all positions, we print "YES". Otherwise, we print "NO".

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the conditions for matching the template \( t \). Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
