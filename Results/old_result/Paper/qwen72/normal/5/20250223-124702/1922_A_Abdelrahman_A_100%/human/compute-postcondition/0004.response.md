Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `tests` from the input, indicating the number of test cases to process. For each test case, it reads three inputs: an integer `slength`, and two strings `a` and `b` of length `slength`. It then reads another string `c` of the same length. The function checks if `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if any character in `c` is not present in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`. If such a character is found, it prints 'YES'. If no such character is found, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the variable `tests` remains unchanged, and the function concludes. **
