Postcondition: ***`a` remains a list of n integers, `b` remains a list of m integers, `good_subarrays` is the number of subarrays of length m in `a` that have at least `k` elements matching the frequency in `b`. If `matches` is at least `k`, `good_subarrays` is incremented by 1. `b_freq` remains a Counter object with the frequency of each integer in `b`, and `window_freq` is a Counter object with the frequency of the last m integers in `a`. `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in `window_freq` and `b_freq` for integers that are present in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`.***
