Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It uses a sliding window approach to count the number of good subarrays of length `m` in the array `a` that can be rearranged to have at least `k` elements matching with the elements in array `b`.

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Reading and Looping Through Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to solve the problem for a single test case.

3. **Initial Setup**:
   - `b_freq` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in `b`.
   - `window_freq` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of the first `m` elements in `a`.
   - `matches` is the initial count of matching elements between the first window of `a` and `b`.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program slides the window from the start to the end of array `a` (from index 0 to `n - m`).
   - For each position of the window:
     - It checks if the current number of matches is at least `k`. If so, it increments `good_subarrays`.
     - It updates the frequency counters and the match count when the window slides:
       - Decrements the frequency of the element that is leaving the window.
       - Removes the element from `window_freq` if its frequency becomes zero.
       - Increments the frequency of the element that is entering the window.
       - Updates the match count accordingly.

5. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, it checks the last window to see if it is good and updates `good_subarrays` if necessary.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of good subarrays for each test case.

The logic and implementation are correct, and the program efficiently handles the constraints provided in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
