You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, b is a list of m integers where 1 <= m <= n and 1 <= k <= m, and each element in a and b is an integer in the range 1 to 10^6.
def func_1(a, b, k, n, m):
    good_subarrays = 0
    b_freq = Counter(b)
    window_freq = Counter(a[:m])
    matches = sum(min(window_freq[x], b_freq[x]) for x in window_freq if x in
    b_freq)
    for i in range(n - m):
        if matches >= k:
            good_subarrays += 1
        
        if a[i] in b_freq:
            matches -= min(window_freq[a[i]], b_freq[a[i]])
        
        window_freq[a[i]] -= 1
        
        if window_freq[a[i]] == 0:
            del window_freq[a[i]]
        
        if a[i + m] in b_freq:
            matches += min(window_freq[a[i + m]] + 1, b_freq[a[i + m]])
        
        window_freq[a[i + m]] += 1
        
    #State: `a` remains a list of n integers, `b` remains a list of m integers, `good_subarrays` is the number of subarrays of length m in `a` that have at least `k` elements matching the frequency in `b`, `b_freq` remains a Counter object with the frequency of each integer in `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object with the frequency of the last m integers in `a`, `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in `window_freq` and `b_freq` for integers that are present in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`.
    if (matches >= k) :
        good_subarrays += 1
    #State: *`a` remains a list of n integers, `b` remains a list of m integers, `good_subarrays` is the number of subarrays of length m in `a` that have at least `k` elements matching the frequency in `b`. If `matches` is at least `k`, `good_subarrays` is incremented by 1. `b_freq` remains a Counter object with the frequency of each integer in `b`, and `window_freq` is a Counter object with the frequency of the last m integers in `a`. `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in `window_freq` and `b_freq` for integers that are present in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`.
    return good_subarrays
    #The program returns the number of subarrays of length m in `a` that have at least `k` elements matching the frequency in `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `a` of `n` integers, a list `b` of `m` integers, and integers `k`, `n`, and `m`. It returns the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that contain at least `k` elements whose frequencies match the frequencies in `b`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the number of subarrays of length m in `a` that have at least `k` elements matching the frequency in `b`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
