### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Frequency Counters:**
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of elements in `b` and the initial window of `a` of length `m`.
   - `b_freq` stores the frequency of each element in `b`.
   - `window_freq` stores the frequency of each element in the initial window of `a`.

3. **Initial Matches Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial number of matches between the elements in the window of `a` and `b` using the formula:
     \[
     \text{matches} = \sum \left( \min(\text{window\_freq}[x], \text{b\_freq}[x]) \right) \text{ for } x \in \text{window\_freq}
     \]
   - This ensures that the program counts the maximum number of matching elements that can be paired between the window of `a` and `b`.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to move through the array `a` from the first position to the last possible position of the window.
   - For each position, it updates the `matches` count:
     - It decreases the count if the element leaving the window is in `b`.
     - It increases the count if the element entering the window is in `b`.
   - The `window_freq` is also updated to reflect the new window.

5. **Counting Good Subarrays:**
   - If the number of matches is greater than or equal to `k`, the program increments the `good_subarrays` counter.
   - After the loop, it checks the final window to see if it is a good subarray.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of good subarrays for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the sliding window approach and the frequency counting logic to determine the number of good subarrays. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
