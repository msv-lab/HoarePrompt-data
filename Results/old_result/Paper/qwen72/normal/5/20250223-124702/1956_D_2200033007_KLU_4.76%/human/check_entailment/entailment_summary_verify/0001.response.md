Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer `n` and a line of space-separated integers. However, it appends these integers as strings to the list `a` instead of converting them to integers. This is a significant issue because the operations and calculations require the elements to be integers, not strings.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1(len(a))` with the length of the array `a` as an argument. This is correct in terms of passing the length of the array to the function.

3. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(c)` is defined to take one argument `c`, which is the length of the array `a`. The function does not actually use the array `a` or any of its elements, which is a critical flaw in the program's design.

4. **Handling Different Array Lengths**:
   - If `c` (the length of the array) is 2, the program prints `4 1` followed by `1 2`. This is correct for the specific case where the array has two elements, and the MEX operation can be applied to the entire array to maximize the sum.
   - If `c` is not 2, the program prints `13 0`. This is incorrect because it assumes that the sum of the array is always 13 and no operations are needed, which is not true for all possible input arrays of length 3 or more. For example, an array `[1, 3, 9]` already has a sum of 13, but an array `[0, 1, 2]` can be transformed to `[3, 3, 3]` with a sum of 9, which is not the maximum possible sum.

5. **General Solution**: The program does not provide a general solution for arrays of length other than 2. It only handles the specific case of an array of length 2 correctly. For other lengths, it fails to compute the correct maximum sum and the sequence of operations needed to achieve that sum.

6. **Output Format**: The output format is correct for the specific case of an array of length 2, but it is incorrect for other lengths because it does not compute the correct sum and operations.

Given the above points, the original assessment is accurate. The program is indeed incorrect because it does not handle the general case of arrays of different lengths and does not compute the correct maximum sum or the sequence of operations for those cases.

Final: **False**
