Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the length of the array `a`. It then reads a line of space-separated integers, splits it into a list of strings `na`, and appends each string to the list `a`. However, the elements are appended as strings, not integers, which is incorrect. The elements should be converted to integers before appending them to the list `a`.

2. **Function Call**: After constructing the list `a`, the program calls `func_1(len(a))` with the length of the array `a` as an argument.

3. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(c)` is defined to take one argument `c`, which is the length of the array `a`.

4. **Handling Different Array Lengths**:
   - If `c` (the length of the array) is 2, the program prints `4 1` followed by `1 2`. This is the correct output for the example where the array has two elements, and the MEX operation can be applied to the entire array to maximize the sum.
   - If `c` is not 2, the program prints `13 0`. This is incorrect because it assumes that the sum of the array is always 13 and no operations are needed, which is not true for all possible input arrays of length 3 or more.

5. **General Solution**: The program does not provide a general solution for arrays of length other than 2. It only handles the specific case of an array of length 2 correctly. For other lengths, it fails to compute the correct maximum sum and the sequence of operations needed to achieve that sum.

6. **Output Format**: The output format is correct for the specific case of an array of length 2, but it is incorrect for other lengths because it does not compute the correct sum and operations.

Given the above points, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the general case of arrays of different lengths and does not compute the correct maximum sum or the sequence of operations for those cases.

Correctness: **False**
