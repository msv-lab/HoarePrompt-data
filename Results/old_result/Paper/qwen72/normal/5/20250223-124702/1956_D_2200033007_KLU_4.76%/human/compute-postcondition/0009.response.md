Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `c` of integers, where the length of the list is between 1 and 18, and each element in the list is between 0 and 10,000,000. The function prints either "4 1" and "1 2" if the length of `c` is exactly 2, or "13 0" otherwise. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the list `c` remains unchanged, and the variable `m` is still 0. **
