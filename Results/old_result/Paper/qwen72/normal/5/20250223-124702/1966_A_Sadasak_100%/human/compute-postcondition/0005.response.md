Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from `arr`, and each value represents the frequency of the corresponding integer in `arr`, with a maximum value of `k`. If an integer appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its frequency in the dictionary is capped at `k`. **
