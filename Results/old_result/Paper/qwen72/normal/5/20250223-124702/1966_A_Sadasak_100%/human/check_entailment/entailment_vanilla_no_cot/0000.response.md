Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards Calculation**:
   - The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and prints `k - 1` if it is. This is incorrect because the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations is not necessarily `k - 1`.
   - The program should calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally.

2. **Frequency Table Update**:
   - The function `func_1` updates the frequency table to cap the count of any number at `k`. This is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The correct approach is to count the actual frequencies of each number.

3. **Optimal Solution**:
   - The optimal solution involves calculating the total number of cards that can be removed by performing the operations. For each number, you can remove `k` cards at a time until fewer than `k` cards of that number remain. The remaining cards cannot be removed, and the sum of these remaining cards across all numbers gives the minimum number of cards left.

### Correct Approach:
1. Count the frequency of each number in the hand.
2. For each number, calculate the remainder when the frequency is divided by `k`.
3. Sum these remainders to get the minimum number of cards left.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums)
        min_cards_left = sum(f % k for f in freq.values())
        print(min_cards_left)

def func_1(arr):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    return frequency_table
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the frequency of each number in the hand.
- **Minimum Cards Left**: The main loop calculates the minimum number of cards left by summing the remainders of the frequencies divided by `k`.

This approach ensures that the program correctly determines the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.
