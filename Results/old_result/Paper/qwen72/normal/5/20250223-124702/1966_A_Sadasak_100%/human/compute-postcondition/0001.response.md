The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100, and each integer in `arr` is within the range 1 <= arr[i] <= 100. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element, and `num` will be the first element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100, and each integer in arr is within the range 1 <= arr[i] <= 100, `arr` must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary**
