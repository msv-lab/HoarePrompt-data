### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the exchange number `k`.
   - It then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If so, it prints `n` because no operations can be performed, and this is correct.

3. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to calculate the frequency of each card number in the list `nums`.
   - It correctly updates the frequency table and ensures that no frequency exceeds `k`.

4. **Optimal Solution**:
   - The program checks if any frequency in the `freq` dictionary is exactly `k`.
   - If a frequency is exactly `k`, it prints `k - 1`. This is because you can exchange `k` cards for `k - 1` cards, and this operation can be performed optimally to reduce the number of cards.
   - If no frequency is exactly `k`, the program prints `n`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of performing multiple operations to reduce the number of cards further.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Final Output**:
  - The program does not correctly handle the case where multiple operations can be performed to reduce the number of cards further.
  - For example, in the fourth test case where `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the program should be able to repeatedly exchange 4 cards numbered 1 for 3 cards numbered 1, resulting in 3 cards left. However, the program will print 10 if no frequency is exactly 4, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach should be to calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally.
- This can be done by:
  - Counting the frequency of each card number.
  - For each frequency, determining the minimum number of cards that cannot be exchanged.
  - Summing these minimum numbers to get the final result.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        min_cards_left = sum((f % k) + (k if f % k == 0 else 0) for f in freq.values())
        print(min_cards_left)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    return frequency_table
```

### Explanation:
- **Frequency Calculation**:
  - The `func_1` function now correctly calculates the frequency of each card number without any cap.
- **Minimum Cards Left Calculation**:
  - For each frequency `f`, the expression `(f % k) + (k if f % k == 0 else 0)` calculates the minimum number of cards that cannot be exchanged.
  - If `f % k == 0`, it means all cards can be exchanged, so we add `k` to the sum.
  - If `f % k != 0`, it means there are `f % k` cards left that cannot be exchanged, so we add `f % k` to the sum.
- **Summing the Results**:
  - The sum of these values gives the minimum number of cards left after performing all possible operations.

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect because it does not handle the optimal reduction of cards through multiple operations.
- The corrected program correctly handles the problem and provides the correct output.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
