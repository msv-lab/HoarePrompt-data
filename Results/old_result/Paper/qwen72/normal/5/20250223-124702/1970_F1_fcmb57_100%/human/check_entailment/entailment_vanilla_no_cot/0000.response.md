Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

1. **Movement Function Error:** The function `func_1` is incorrectly defined. The movement directions are defined as `mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}`, but the function `func_1` should add these movements to the current position. However, the function incorrectly adds the movement to the x-coordinate first and then the y-coordinate. The correct implementation should be:

   ```python
   def func_1(a, b):
       (x, y) = a
       (dx, dy) = b
       return (x + dx, y + dy)
   ```

   This should be:

   ```python
   def func_1(a, b):
       (x, y) = a
       (dx, dy) = b
       return (x + dx, y + dy)
   ```

2. **Quaffle Handling:** The program does not handle the Quaffle's position or the actions related to catching and throwing the Quaffle. The Quaffle's position should be tracked, and when a player catches or throws the Quaffle, the program should update the Quaffle's position accordingly.

3. **Scoring Logic:** The scoring logic is incorrect. The program should check if the player is carrying the Quaffle before scoring and should also handle the case where a player scores in their own goal. The Quaffle should be reset to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

4. **Quaffle Reset:** After a goal is scored, the Quaffle should be reset to the middle of the field, but the program does not handle this.

5. **Catching the Quaffle:** The program does not handle the action where a player catches the Quaffle. This is a crucial part of the game logic.

6. **Throwing the Quaffle:** The program does not handle the action where a player throws the Quaffle. This should be an action that updates the Quaffle's position to the player's current position.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and needs significant changes to function as described in the problem statement.
