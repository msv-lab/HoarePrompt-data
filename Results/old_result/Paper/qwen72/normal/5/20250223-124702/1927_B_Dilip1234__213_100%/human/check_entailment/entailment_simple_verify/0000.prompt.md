You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

- Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and for the given trace a, there exists a suitable string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z.
def func_1(n, a):
    s = ''

                s += chr(j + ord('a'))

    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n, `s` is a string of length n, `char_count` is a list of 26 integers where each integer represents the count of the corresponding character from 'a' to 'z' that has been added to `s`.
    return s
    #The program returns the string `s` of length `n`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, and `s` is composed of characters from 'a' to 'z'. The exact composition of `s` is determined by the counts stored in the list `char_count`, which contains 26 integers representing the count of each character from 'a' to 'z' in `s`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly reconstructs a string from its trace for every potential case. The function `func_1` initializes an empty string `s` and a list `char_count` to keep track of the number of occurrences of each character. For each element in the trace array `a`, it finds the first character (from 'a' to 'z') whose count matches the current trace value, appends that character to the string `s`, and increments the count for that character. This approach ensures that the string `s` is constructed such that the trace of `s` matches the given trace array `a` for all valid inputs. Since the problem guarantees that a valid answer exists for each test case, the program will always produce a correct string.
