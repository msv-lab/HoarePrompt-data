Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n, `s` is an empty string.** 

The initial state is updated to reflect that the variable `s` is now an empty string. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
