Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n` from input. It then calculates the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // n`. If `x // n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints the largest such divisor. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. **
