The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to start, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
