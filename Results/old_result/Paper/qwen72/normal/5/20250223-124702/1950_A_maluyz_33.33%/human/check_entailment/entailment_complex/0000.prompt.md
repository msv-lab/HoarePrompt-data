Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are digits (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations for the given value of t. The values of a, b, and c for each test case have been processed, and the appropriate output ('STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE') has been printed for each test case. The variables a, b, and c are not retained between iterations, and their final values are undefined. The value of t remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (each between 0 and 9) and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a <= b >= c` and `b` is the maximum, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value, and the state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed and the appropriate output has been printed for each. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained between iterations, and their final values are undefined. The value of `t` remains unchanged.
