The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (each between 0 and 9) and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a <= b >= c` and `b` is the maximum, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value, and the state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed and the appropriate output has been printed for each. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained between iterations, and their final values are undefined. The value of `t` remains unchanged.
