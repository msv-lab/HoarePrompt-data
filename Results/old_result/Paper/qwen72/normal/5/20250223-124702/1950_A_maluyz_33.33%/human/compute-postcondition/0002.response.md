Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations for the given value of t. The values of a, b, and c for each test case have been processed, and the appropriate output ('STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE') has been printed for each test case. The variables a, b, and c are not retained between iterations, and their final values are undefined. The value of t remains unchanged.**
