Reasoning:

The original assessment is generally accurate, but let's break down the program and function summary to ensure all aspects are correctly evaluated:

1. **Password Composition**:
   - The program implicitly handles the composition of the password by using `isdigit()` and `isalpha()` to separate characters into digits and letters. This ensures that the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.

2. **No Digit After a Letter**:
   - The program iterates through the password and checks if there is any digit that comes immediately after a letter using the condition `if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit()`. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'. This correctly enforces the rule that no digit should come after a letter.

3. **Sorted Digits**:
   - The program collects all digits in a list and checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order using `if digits != sorted(digits)`. If the digits are not sorted, it returns 'NO'. This correctly enforces the rule that all digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. **Sorted Letters**:
   - The program collects all letters in a list and checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order using `if letters != sorted(letters)`. If the letters are not sorted, it returns 'NO'. This correctly enforces the rule that all letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty Password**: The problem description specifies that the password length \( n \) is at least 1, so an empty password is not a valid input.
   - **Single Character Password**: The program correctly handles single character passwords, whether they are a letter or a digit, as the conditions for sorting and no digit after a letter are trivially satisfied.
   - **Only Digits or Only Letters**: The program correctly handles passwords that consist only of digits or only of letters, as the conditions for sorting and no digit after a letter are trivially satisfied.

However, there is one potential issue that needs to be addressed:

- **Order of Digits and Letters**:
  - The program checks if there is any digit that comes immediately after a letter, but it does not explicitly check if all letters come before any digits. This is a subtle but important point because the condition "there should be no digit that comes after a letter" implies that all letters should appear before any digits in the string.

To ensure the program is fully correct, we need to add a check to ensure that all letters appear before any digits. This can be done by checking if the first occurrence of a digit, if any, comes after the last occurrence of a letter.

Let's modify the function to include this check:

```python
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    # Check if all letters come before any digits
    if letters and digits and password.index(digits[0]) < password.rindex(letters[-1]):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

With this modification, the function will correctly handle the case where all letters must come before any digits.

Given the original program and the function summary, the original assessment was accurate in terms of the logic and edge cases it considered. However, the additional check for the order of letters and digits is necessary to fully meet the problem's requirements.

Final: **False** (The original program is not fully correct without the additional check for the order of letters and digits.)
