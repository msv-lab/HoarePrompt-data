Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a string `password` of length `n` (where `1 <= n <= 20` and `password` consists of lowercase Latin letters and digits). It returns 'NO' if the letters in `password` are not sorted in non-decreasing order, if the digits in `password` are not sorted in non-decreasing order, or if there is a lowercase letter immediately followed by a digit in `password`. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'. **
