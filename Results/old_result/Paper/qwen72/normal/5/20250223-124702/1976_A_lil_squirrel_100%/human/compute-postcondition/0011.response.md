The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the result of `len(password) - 1`. For the loop to execute, the range must contain at least one value, which means `len(password) - 1` must be greater than 0. This implies that `len(password)` must be at least 2. 

Given the initial state, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `password` is a string of length `n`. To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 2. The variable `i` will start at 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`, `letters` is sorted, and `digits` is sorted, `i` is 0**
