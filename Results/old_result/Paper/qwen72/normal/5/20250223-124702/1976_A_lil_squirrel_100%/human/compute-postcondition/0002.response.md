The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ch` and the string `password`. The loop will execute if `password` is not empty. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20 and `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n` or the length of `password`. However, for the loop to start, `ch` must be the first character of `password`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is an empty list, `digits` is an empty list, `ch` is the first character of `password`**
