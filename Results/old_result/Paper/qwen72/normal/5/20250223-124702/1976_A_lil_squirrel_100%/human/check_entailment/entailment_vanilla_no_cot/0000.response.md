Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.

2. **Separation of Digits and Letters**: The program separates the characters in the password into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits.

3. **Sorting Check**:
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Order of Digits and Letters**: The program ensures that no digit comes after a letter by iterating through the password and checking if a letter is followed by a digit. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.

5. **Final Return**: If all checks pass, the program returns 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem statement, and it produces the correct output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
