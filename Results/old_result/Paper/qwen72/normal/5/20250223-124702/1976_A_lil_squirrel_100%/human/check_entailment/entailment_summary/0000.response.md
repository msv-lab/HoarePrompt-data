Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the conditions specified for a strong password. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets each requirement:

1. **Password Composition**: The program assumes that the input password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, as per the problem description. This is not explicitly checked in the code, but it is a valid assumption based on the input constraints.

2. **Letters Sorted in Non-Decreasing Order**: The program separates the letters from the password and checks if they are sorted in non-decreasing order using `sorted(letters)`. If the letters are not sorted, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Digits Sorted in Non-Decreasing Order**: Similarly, the program separates the digits from the password and checks if they are sorted in non-decreasing order using `sorted(digits)`. If the digits are not sorted, it returns 'NO'.

4. **No Digit After a Letter**: The program iterates through the password and checks if there is any digit immediately following a letter. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.

5. **Final Check**: If all the above conditions are satisfied, the program returns 'YES'.

The execution summary confirms that the function behaves as expected, returning 'NO' if any of the conditions are violated and 'YES' otherwise.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to be correct and meets all the specified requirements.

Correctness: **True**
