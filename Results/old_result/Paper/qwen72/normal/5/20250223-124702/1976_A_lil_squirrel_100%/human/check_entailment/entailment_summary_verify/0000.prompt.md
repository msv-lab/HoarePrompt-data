You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a string `password` of length `n` (where `1 <= n <= 20` and `password` consists of lowercase Latin letters and digits). It returns 'NO' if the letters in `password` are not sorted in non-decreasing order, if the digits in `password` are not sorted in non-decreasing order, or if there is a lowercase letter immediately followed by a digit in `password`. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why it works for every potential case:

1. **Password Composition**: The program checks if the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits by using the `isdigit()` and `isalpha()` methods. This is implicitly handled by the logic that separates letters and digits into different lists.

2. **No Digit After a Letter**: The program iterates through the password and checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Sorted Digits**: The program collects all digits in a list and checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order using the `sorted()` function. If the digits are not sorted, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Sorted Letters**: Similarly, the program collects all letters in a list and checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order using the `sorted()` function. If the letters are not sorted, it returns 'NO'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty Password**: The problem description specifies that the password length \( n \) is at least 1, so an empty password is not a valid input.
   - **Single Character Password**: The program correctly handles single character passwords, whether they are a letter or a digit.
   - **Only Digits or Only Letters**: The program correctly handles passwords that consist only of digits or only of letters, as the conditions for sorting and no digit after a letter are trivially satisfied.

Since the program correctly handles all the conditions and edge cases specified in the problem description, it is considered correct.
