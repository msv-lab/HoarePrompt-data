Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by constructing a sequence of powers of 2 and then modifying it to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`. However, there are a few issues with the approach:

1. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The program constructs a sequence of powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\). This is a good start because the sum of any subset of these powers can represent any number in the range [1, \(2^{24} - 1\)].
   - However, the program then tries to modify this sequence to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.

2. **Modification of Sequence**:
   - The program finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` and removes it from the sequence.
   - It then appends `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the sequence.
   - This approach does not guarantee that the resulting sequence will meet the problem's requirements. Specifically, it does not ensure that there is no subsequence that sums to `k` and that all other values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by some subsequence.

3. **Correctness Issues**:
   - The sequence constructed by the program may not always be valid. For example, if `k` is a power of 2, removing it and adding the other elements may not prevent a subsequence from summing to `k`.
   - The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, when `k` is very close to `n`, the modifications may not ensure that all values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve constructing a sequence that ensures:
- No subsequence sums to `k`.
- All other values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by some subsequence.

One possible correct solution is to use a sequence that includes all powers of 2 up to the largest power of 2 less than `k`, and then carefully add elements to ensure that all values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed. This can be done by adding `k + 1` and ensuring that the sequence does not include `k`.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24) if (1 << i) < k]
        if k < n:
            nums.append(k + 1)
        if sum(nums) < n:
            nums.append(n - sum(nums))
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)
```

This solution ensures that:
- The sequence includes all powers of 2 less than `k`, which guarantees that no subsequence sums to `k`.
- It adds `k + 1` to the sequence to ensure that all values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed.
- It also adds an additional element if necessary to ensure the sum of the sequence is at least `n`.

This approach is more robust and should correctly solve the problem for all valid inputs.
