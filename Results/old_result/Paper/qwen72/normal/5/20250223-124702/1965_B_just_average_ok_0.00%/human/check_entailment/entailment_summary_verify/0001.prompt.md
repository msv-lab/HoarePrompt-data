You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n). For each test case, it modifies a list `nums` that initially contains powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23. It then adds three new elements to `nums` and removes one element, and prints the length of `nums` followed by the elements in `nums`. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but the final state of `nums` will be modified based on the last test case, and the output will reflect the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all integers `v` from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`), there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Initial Sequence Construction:**
   - The program starts by creating a sequence `nums` of powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\). This sequence is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ..., 2^{23}]`.
   - The length of this sequence is 24, which is within the limit of 25.

3. **Finding the Index:**
   - The program finds the largest index `idx` such that \(2^{\text{idx}} \leq k\). This is done by incrementing `idx` until \(2^{\text{idx}}\) exceeds `k`, then decrementing `idx` by 1.
   - This ensures that \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

4. **Modifying the Sequence:**
   - The program then appends three new elements to `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This is a non-negative integer because \(2^{\text{idx}} \leq k\).
     - `k + 1`: This is a non-negative integer and ensures that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This is a non-negative integer and ensures that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.
   - The program removes \(2^{\text{idx}}\) from `nums` to ensure that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the modified `nums` sequence.
   - It then prints the elements of the modified `nums` sequence.

### Analysis:
- **Subsequence Sum Constraints:**
  - By removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\) and adding `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the program ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k`.
  - The added elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` are chosen to cover the gaps in the sequence and ensure that all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed.
- **Sequence Size:**
  - The initial sequence has 24 elements.
  - The program adds 3 elements and removes 1 element, resulting in a sequence of 26 elements.
  - However, the sequence size is limited to 25, so this part of the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it can produce a sequence of size 26, which exceeds the allowed size of 25.

### Correctness:
**False**
