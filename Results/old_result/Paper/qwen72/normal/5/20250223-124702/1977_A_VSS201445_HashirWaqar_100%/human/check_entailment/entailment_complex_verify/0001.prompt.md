You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has executed all iterations, and for each test case, it has printed 'YES' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even, otherwise it has printed 'NO'. The variables `n` and `m` are no longer in scope after the loop completes, and the variable `t` (number of test cases) is unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two non-negative integers `n` and `m` from the input. It then prints 'YES' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the variables `n` and `m` are no longer in scope, while `t` remains unchanged. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can perform two types of moves: adding a cube or removing a cube.
   - After \( n \) moves, we need to determine if the tower can have exactly \( m \) cubes.
   - The initial height of the tower is 0 cubes.

2. **Conditions for Validity:**
   - For the tower to have exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves, the number of "add" moves must be exactly \( m \) more than the number of "remove" moves.
   - Let \( a \) be the number of "add" moves and \( r \) be the number of "remove" moves.
   - We have the equations:
     - \( a + r = n \) (total moves)
     - \( a - r = m \) (net cubes added)

3. **Solving the Equations:**
   - Adding the two equations:
     - \( (a + r) + (a - r) = n + m \)
     - \( 2a = n + m \)
     - \( a = \frac{n + m}{2} \)
   - Subtracting the second equation from the first:
     - \( (a + r) - (a - r) = n - m \)
     - \( 2r = n - m \)
     - \( r = \frac{n - m}{2} \)

4. **Constraints:**
   - Both \( a \) and \( r \) must be non-negative integers.
   - \( a = \frac{n + m}{2} \) must be an integer, which means \( n + m \) must be even.
   - \( r = \frac{n - m}{2} \) must be an integer, which means \( n - m \) must be even.
   - Since \( n \) and \( m \) are both integers, \( n + m \) and \( n - m \) will both be even if and only if \( n \) and \( m \) are either both even or both odd.

5. **Checking the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It checks two conditions:
     - \( n \ge m \): This ensures that the number of moves is at least the number of cubes needed.
     - \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \): This ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even, meaning \( n \) and \( m \) are either both even or both odd.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to have exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.
   - The conditions \( n \ge m \) and \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \) are both necessary and sufficient for the problem.
