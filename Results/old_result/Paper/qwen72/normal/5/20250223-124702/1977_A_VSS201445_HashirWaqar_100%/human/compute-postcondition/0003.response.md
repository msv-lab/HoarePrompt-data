Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two non-negative integers `n` and `m` from the input. It then prints 'YES' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the variables `n` and `m` are no longer in scope, while `t` remains unchanged. The function does not return any value. **
