Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Condition Checking**:
   - `n >= m`: This ensures that the number of moves `n` is at least as large as the desired number of cubes `m`. This is necessary because if `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to build a tower with `m` cubes.
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This ensures that the difference between the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` is even. This is because each move can either add or remove one cube, and to end up with exactly `m` cubes, the number of add and remove operations must balance out in such a way that the difference is even.

3. **Output**: The program prints "YES" if both conditions are met, and "NO" otherwise. This matches the problem's requirements.

Given these points, the program is correct for the problem described.
