The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `m`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 <= t <= 100. `n` and `m` are non-negative integers with the constraint 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `m` for each case.
