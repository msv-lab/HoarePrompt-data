Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from the given sticks. A regular polygon requires at least 3 sticks of the same length. The function `func_1` correctly counts the frequency of each stick length and then calculates the number of polygons that can be formed by performing integer division of each frequency by 3. However, this approach is incorrect because it assumes that each polygon must have exactly 3 sides (triangles), which is not the case. Regular polygons can have any number of sides greater than or equal to 3. To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with any number of sides (3 or more) for each stick length.

For example, if there are 6 sticks of the same length, the program should be able to form 2 polygons (either 2 triangles, 1 square, or 1 hexagon), but the current implementation only counts the number of triangles.

Correctness: **False**
