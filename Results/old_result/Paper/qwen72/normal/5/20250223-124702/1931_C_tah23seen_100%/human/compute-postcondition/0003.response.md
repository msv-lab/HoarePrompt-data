To determine if the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to evaluate the conditions in the loop head:

1. `i < len(arr) - 1`
2. `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`

Given the program state:
- `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr).
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is equal to the length of `arr`.
- `j` is equal to `n` - 1.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Condition 1: `i < len(arr) - 1`**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `len(arr) - 1` is `n - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `0 < n - 1` must be true.
   - This simplifies to `n > 1`.
   - Since `n` is the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is at least 1, `n > 1` means `arr` must have at least 2 elements.

2. **Condition 2: `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `i + 1` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute, `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`.

Given these conditions, the loop will execute if:
- `n` (the length of `arr`) is greater than 1.
- `arr[0]` is equal to `arr[1]`.

Since `n` is already equal to the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is at least 1, we need to ensure that `arr` has at least 2 elements and that `arr[0]` is equal to `arr[1]`.

Therefore, the modified state is:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 0; `n` is equal to the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 1; `j` is equal to `n` - 1; `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`**
