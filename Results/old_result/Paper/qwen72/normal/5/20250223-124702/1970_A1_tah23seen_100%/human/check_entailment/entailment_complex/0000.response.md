Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input string `n` and passes it to the function `func_1`. The input is guaranteed to be a non-empty, balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.

2. **Balance Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the balance of the parentheses sequence at each position. It uses a dictionary `d` to store the balance at each position, starting from 0. For each character in the string:
   - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
   - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   This correctly computes the balance of the prefixes of the sequence.

3. **Dictionary Preparation**: After computing the balances, the program removes the last entry from the dictionary `d` (which is the balance at the end of the string, and should be 0 for a balanced sequence). This step is necessary because the balance at the end of the sequence is not needed for the sorting step.

4. **Sorting**: The dictionary `d` is then sorted based on the balance in ascending order, and for ties, the positions are sorted in descending order. This sorting step is crucial for the balanced shuffle operation. The sorted dictionary will have the positions of the characters in the order required to form the balanced shuffle.

5. **Constructing the Result**: The program constructs the result string `ans` by appending characters from the original string `s` at the positions specified by the sorted dictionary `d`. This step ensures that the characters are placed in the correct order to form the balanced shuffle.

6. **Output**: The function returns the constructed string `ans`, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string `s`.

The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The balance calculation, sorting, and construction of the result string are all performed accurately.

Correctness: **True**
