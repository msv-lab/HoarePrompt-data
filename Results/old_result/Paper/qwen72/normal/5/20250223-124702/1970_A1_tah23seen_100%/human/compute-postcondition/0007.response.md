The code snippet sorts the dictionary `d` based on the values (depth of parentheses) and, in case of ties, based on the negative of the keys (positions). The removal of `d[n]` and the initial state of `ans` being an empty string are not affected by this sorting operation.

Output State: **`d[n]` is removed from the dictionary `d`, `ans` is an empty string, and `d` is now a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a key and its corresponding value, sorted first by the value (depth of parentheses) in ascending order, and then by the negative of the key (position) in ascending order.**
