Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the hour is "12" correctly for PM times. According to the problem description, "12:00" in 24-hour format should be "12:00 PM" in 12-hour format, but the program incorrectly sets it to "12:00 AM". This is because the program does not differentiate between "12" in the AM and PM periods. It always sets "12" to "AM" regardless of the actual time. 

For example, the input "12:00" should produce "12:00 PM" but the program will produce "12:00 AM".
