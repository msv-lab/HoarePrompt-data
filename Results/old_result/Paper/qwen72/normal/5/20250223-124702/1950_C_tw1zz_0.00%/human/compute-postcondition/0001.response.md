Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided. For each test case, the loop will read a time in the format "hh:mm" and convert the hour to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. The output state after all iterations will be a series of converted times, each on a new line, in the format "hh:mm AM/PM". The variables `h1`, `m1`, and `time` will be updated for each iteration based on the input time, but their final values will be the ones from the last iteration. The initial state of `t` and the input times will remain unchanged.**
