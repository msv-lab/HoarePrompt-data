The function `func` accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a time string `s` in the format "hh:mm" (where `hh` is the hour from 00 to 23 and `mm` is the minute from 00 to 59). It converts the hour to a 12-hour format and appends the appropriate AM/PM notation. The function prints the converted time for each test case in the format "hh:mm AM/PM". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state of the program includes the output of all converted times, each on a new line. The variables `h1`, `m1`, and `time` are updated for each iteration, but their final values will be the ones from the last iteration. The initial state of `t` and the input times remain unchanged.
