The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `s`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with a range of 1 to 1440. `s` is a string representing a time in 24-hour format, with a length of 5 and the format "hh:mm", where `hh` is the hour (00 to 23) and `mm` is the minute (00 to 59). The input `s` is always a valid time.

However, the provided function signature does not include these parameters. Assuming the function should handle these parameters, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) and a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" (where `hh` is the hour from 00 to 23 and `mm` is the minute from 00 to 59). The function processes `t` test cases, each with a valid time string `s`, and returns the processed result for each test case.**
