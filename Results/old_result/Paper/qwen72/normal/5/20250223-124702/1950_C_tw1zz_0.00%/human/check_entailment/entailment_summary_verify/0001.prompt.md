You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a time string `s` in the format "hh:mm" (where `hh` is the hour from 00 to 23 and `mm` is the minute from 00 to 59). It converts the hour to a 12-hour format and appends the appropriate AM/PM notation. The function prints the converted time for each test case in the format "hh:mm AM/PM". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state of the program includes the output of all converted times, each on a new line. The variables `h1`, `m1`, and `time` are updated for each iteration, but their final values will be the ones from the last iteration. The initial state of `t` and the input times remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` of the format `hh:mm` and splits it into `h` (hours) and `m` (minutes).

2. **Time Conversion:**
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the 24-hour format hours to 12-hour format hours and determine whether it is `AM` or `PM`.
   - For hours from `01` to `11`, the program correctly sets the hour to the same value and appends `AM`.
   - For hour `12`, the program correctly sets the hour to `12` and appends `AM`.
   - For hours from `13` to `23`, the program correctly sets the hour to the corresponding 12-hour format hour and appends `PM`.
   - For hour `00`, the program correctly sets the hour to `12` and appends `PM`.

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program constructs the output string in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` and prints it using `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly:
     - `00:00` is converted to `12:00 AM`.
     - `12:00` is converted to `12:00 PM`.
     - `00:59` is converted to `12:59 AM`.
     - `23:59` is converted to `11:59 PM`.

5. **General Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles all other general cases within the 24-hour format.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly converts the 24-hour format time to the 12-hour format time and handles all edge cases and general cases as expected.
