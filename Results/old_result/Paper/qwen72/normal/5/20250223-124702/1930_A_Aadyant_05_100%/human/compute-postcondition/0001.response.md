Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, a is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, final is an empty list.**

The variable `final` is now an empty list, while the other variables `t`, `n`, and `a` retain their initial values and properties.
