Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read `n` and `k` from the input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it will print `1`. Otherwise, it will print `n`. After all iterations, the value of `i` will be `t`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `t` will remain unchanged as they are input values and not modified within the loop.**
