You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and k is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that Dominater can destroy (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2). The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read `n` and `k` from the input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it will print `1`. Otherwise, it will print `n`. After all iterations, the value of `i` will be `t`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `t` will remain unchanged as they are input values and not modified within the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - There are \( n \) islands, and initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge.
   - Dominater can destroy at most \( k \) bridges to minimize the number of islands that Everule can visit.
   - We need to find the minimum number of islands (including island 1) that Everule can visit after Dominater optimally destroys the bridges.

2. **Initial Observations:**
   - If \( k \) is 0, no bridges are destroyed, and Everule can visit all \( n \) islands.
   - If \( k \) is at least \( n-1 \), Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, isolating it and making it the only island Everule can visit.

3. **Key Insight:**
   - The number of bridges connected to any single island is \( n-1 \).
   - If \( k \) is less than \( n-1 \), Dominater cannot isolate island 1 completely. Everule will still be able to visit all \( n \) islands because there will always be at least one bridge connecting island 1 to another island, and from there, Everule can visit all other islands.

4. **Algorithm:**
   - For each test case:
     - If \( k \geq n-1 \), print 1 (Everule can only visit island 1).
     - Otherwise, print \( n \) (Everule can visit all islands).

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It checks if \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n-1 \). If true, it prints 1.
   - If false, it prints \( n \).

6. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where \( k \) is 0 or \( k \geq n-1 \).
   - It also correctly handles the general case where \( k < n-1 \).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above.
