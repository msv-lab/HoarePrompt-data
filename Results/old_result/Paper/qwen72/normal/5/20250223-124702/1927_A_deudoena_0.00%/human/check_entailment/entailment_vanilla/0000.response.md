### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to make the entire strip white.
   - The strip is represented by a string of 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters.
   - We need to identify the first and last black cells and paint the segment between them.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the input string `inpstr`.
   - It initializes three variables: `ind1`, `ind2`, and `outind` to 0.
   - The first loop finds the index of the first black cell (`ind1`).
   - The second loop finds the index of the last black cell from the end of the string (`ind2`).
   - The program then calculates the length of the segment to be painted as `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The program does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.
   - The program does not read the number of test cases `t`.
   - The program does not read the length of the strip `n` for each test case.
   - The program does not print the output for each test case in a loop.

4. **Correcting the Program:**
   - We need to read the number of test cases `t` and loop through each test case.
   - For each test case, we need to read the length of the strip `n` and the strip string `s`.
   - We need to find the first and last black cells in the strip.
   - We need to calculate the minimum length of the segment to be painted and print it for each test case.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def solve_test_case(n, s):
    ind1 = -1
    ind2 = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'B':
            if ind1 == -1:
                ind1 = i
            ind2 = i
    return ind2 - ind1 + 1 if ind1 != -1 else 1

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input().strip()
        print(solve_test_case(n, s))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`solve_test_case(n, s)`:**
  - This function takes the length of the strip `n` and the strip string `s`.
  - It initializes `ind1` and `ind2` to -1 to indicate that no black cells have been found yet.
  - It iterates through the string to find the first and last black cells.
  - It returns the length of the segment to be painted, which is `ind2 - ind1 + 1`.
  - If there are no black cells, it returns 1 (though the problem guarantees at least one black cell).

- **`main()`:**
  - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - It loops through each test case, reading the length of the strip `n` and the strip string `s`.
  - It calls `solve_test_case(n, s)` for each test case and prints the result.

### Correctness:
- The original program does not handle multiple test cases and does not read the length of the strip for each test case.
- The original program also does not correctly calculate the length of the segment to be painted.

**Correctness: False**
