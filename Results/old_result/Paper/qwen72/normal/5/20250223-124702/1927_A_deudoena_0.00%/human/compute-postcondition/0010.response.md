The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases and is constrained to the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each tuple in the list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in each strip is black.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. The result for each test case is a string indicating whether the strip can be split into two non-empty parts such that each part contains at least one black cell.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` with characters 'W' and 'B'. It returns a list of strings, each indicating whether the corresponding strip can be split into two non-empty parts, each containing at least one black cell.**
