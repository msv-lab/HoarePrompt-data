The function `func` reads a string `inpstr` from the user input, finds the index of the first occurrence of 'B' (`ind1`) and the index of the last occurrence of 'B' (`ind2`) in the string, and then prints the length of the substring between these two indices, inclusive. The function does not return any value. The parameters `t` and the list of tuples mentioned in the comments are not used in the function.
