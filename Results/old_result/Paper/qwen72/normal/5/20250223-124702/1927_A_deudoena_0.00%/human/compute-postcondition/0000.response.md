Initial State: The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell, and it is guaranteed that at least one cell in each strip is black.

```
inpstr = input()
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The code snippet `inpstr = input()` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `inpstr`. The values of `t` and the list of tuples are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `inpstr` is a string containing user input, and the function still takes a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell, and it is guaranteed that at least one cell in each strip is black.**
