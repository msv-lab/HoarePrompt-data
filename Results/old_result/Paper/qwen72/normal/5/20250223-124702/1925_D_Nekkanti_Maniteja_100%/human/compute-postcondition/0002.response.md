The function `func` does not explicitly list the parameters in its definition, but based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters. These parameters include:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `n`: An integer representing the number of nodes or elements, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `m`: An integer representing the number of edges or relationships, where 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2).
- `k`: An integer representing a threshold or limit, where 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `edges`: A list of m tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (a_i, b_i, f_i). Each a_i and b_i are distinct and within the range 1 to n, and each f_i is within the range 1 to 10^9.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the constraints and relationships provided. However, the specific output is not detailed in the provided information. Given the constraints, the function is likely designed to handle multiple test cases and perform some operation involving the nodes, edges, and threshold `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple parameters including the number of test cases `t`, the number of nodes `n`, the number of edges `m`, a threshold `k`, and a list of edges. It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the constraints and relationships provided, handling multiple test cases.**
