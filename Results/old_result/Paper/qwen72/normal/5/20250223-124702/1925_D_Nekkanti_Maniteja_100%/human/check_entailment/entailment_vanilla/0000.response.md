### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes `M` as \(10^9 + 7\), which is a common modulus used in competitive programming to avoid large numbers and ensure results fit within standard integer ranges.
   - It calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\). This is correct because the teacher chooses pairs equiprobably, and the total number of pairs is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

2. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly sums the initial friendship values `a` of all pairs of friends.
   - This is done by reading `m` lines, each containing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value, and adding these values to `a`.

3. **Calculating the Expected Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - The program then iterates over `k` excursions and calculates the expected sum of friendship values.
   - For each excursion, it updates `s` by adding the expected increase in friendship value.
   - The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion is calculated as `c * i * c * m + c * a`.
     - `c * i * c * m` represents the expected increase in friendship value due to the increase in the friendship value of pairs chosen in previous excursions.
     - `c * a` represents the expected increase in friendship value due to the initial friendship values of the pairs.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The program uses modular arithmetic to ensure that all intermediate results and the final result are within the range of \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The final result is printed as `s % M`.

5. **Efficiency and Constraints:**
   - The program efficiently handles the constraints by using modular inverse and modular arithmetic, which are necessary for large values of `n` and `k`.
   - The time complexity is \(O(m + k)\) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

6. **Correctness of the Formula:**
   - The formula used to update `s` is correct. The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion is indeed the sum of the expected increase due to previous excursions and the initial friendship values.
   - The use of the modular inverse `c` ensures that the probability of choosing any pair is correctly accounted for.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its approach and implementation. It correctly calculates the expected sum of friendship values and handles the constraints efficiently.

Correctness: **True**
