Reasoning:  
The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, calling the function `func_1` for each one. The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input and checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. However, this logic is flawed because it does not consider the nature of the moves Nikita can make. Specifically, the program should check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, because each move can either add or remove a cube, and the net effect of `n` moves must be an even number of cubes added or removed to end up with exactly `m` cubes.

For example:
- If `n = 3` and `m = 3`, Nikita can add a cube 3 times, which is correct.
- If `n = 2` and `m = 4`, Nikita cannot achieve this because after 2 moves, he can only have 0 or 2 cubes, not 4.
- If `n = 5` and `m = 3`, Nikita can achieve this by adding 4 cubes and removing 1 cube, which is correct.

The correct logic should be:
- If `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, then it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, so the answer should be 'Yes'.
- Otherwise, the answer should be 'No'.

Given the current implementation, the program will incorrectly output 'Yes' for cases where `n` is greater than or equal to `m` but the difference between `n` and `m` is odd, which is not always correct.

Correctness: **False**
