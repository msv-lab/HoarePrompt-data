Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes in the tower). However, this logic is flawed because it does not consider the nature of the moves (putting or removing cubes).

To correctly determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, we need to consider the following:

1. If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves because you can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
2. If `n` is equal to `m`, it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves by simply adding a cube in each move.
3. If `n` is greater than `m`, it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves if and only if the difference `n - m` is even. This is because each pair of moves (one add and one remove) cancels out, and you can end up with `m` cubes if the remaining moves are even.

The given program does not account for the parity (evenness or oddness) of the difference `n - m`, which is crucial for the correct solution. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This corrected version checks if the difference `n - m` is even, which is the correct condition to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
