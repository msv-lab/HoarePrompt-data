The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state describes that `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, and `n` is less than `m`. However, the `print` statement does not use these variables or any other objects from the initial state. It simply prints a constant string.

Output: **No**
