Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem of determining whether, after `n` moves, a tower can have exactly `m` cubes. The program reads the number of test cases, `t`, and then for each test case, it calls the function `func_1` to process the input and determine the result.

However, the program has a critical flaw in the function `func_1`. The function does not accept any parameters, but it should. The function reads `n` and `m` from user input within the loop, which is correct, but the logic to determine whether the tower can have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves is flawed.

The correct logic should be:
- If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `n - m` is even, then it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because each move can either add or remove a cube, and to end up with exactly `m` cubes, the number of "add" moves must be `m` and the number of "remove" moves must be `n - m`. For this to be possible, `n - m` must be even (since each "remove" move must be balanced by a "put" move to end up with the exact number of cubes).

The current logic in `func_1` only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is insufficient. For example, in the test case `2 4`, `n` is less than `m`, so the function correctly prints "No". However, in the test case `5 3`, the function prints "Yes" because `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, but it should print "No" because the difference `5 - 3 = 2` is even, and it is possible to end up with exactly 3 cubes after 5 moves (e.g., add 3 cubes, remove 1 cube, add 1 cube).

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the logic for determining whether the tower can have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Correctness: **False**
