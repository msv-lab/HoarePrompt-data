You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `results` is a list of strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether it is possible to reach the end of the second row from the start of the first row for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two strings `row1` and `row2`. These inputs are stored in a list of tuples `test_cases`.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `test_cases`.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `results` to store the result for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes two boolean variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` to track whether the robot can reach the end of the first and second rows, respectively.
   - It iterates through each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If the robot is in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
       - If the arrow in the first row points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
         - If the robot is at the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can move to the second row and potentially reach the target).
       - If the arrow in the first row points to the left (`row1[j] == '<'`):
         - The robot can no longer move in the first row (`reachable_first_row = False`).
         - If the robot is not at the last column (`j < n - 1`) and the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
     - If the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
       - If the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`):
         - If the robot is at the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can reach the target).
   - After the loop, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

4. **Output**: The program prints the results for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is even.
   - The program ensures that the robot cannot skip a move and cannot go outside the grid.
   - The program correctly checks if the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.

6. **Logical Flaws**:
   - The logic for updating `reachable_second_row` in the first row check is incorrect. The robot should only move to the second row if the arrow in the first row points down, which is not possible in this grid setup (arrows only point left or right).
   - The logic for updating `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` is not consistent. The robot should be able to switch rows based on the direction of the arrows, but the current logic does not handle this correctly.

Given these logical flaws, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
