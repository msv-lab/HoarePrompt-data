Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This means `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
2. `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`. This means `n` is derived from the last element of the `data` list, which is a string, and it is converted to an integer.
3. `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 10^6\). This means `arr` is a list of integers, each between 1 and 1,000,000.
4. `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`. This means `data` is a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input.
5. `index` is equal to the length of `data`. This means `index` is the number of elements in the `data` list.
6. `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element is the result of calling `func_1` on a list of integers. This means `results` is a list of `t` elements, where each element is the result of a function call `func_1` on some list of integers.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `t`**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
2. **Determine the value of `index`**: `index` is the length of the `data` list.
3. **Determine the value of `n`**: `n` is the integer value of the last element in the `data` list, which is `data[index - 1]`.
4. **Determine the value of `arr`**: `arr` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 1,000,000.
5. **Determine the value of `results`**: `results` is a list of `t` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_1` on a list of integers. The exact values of these elements depend on the implementation of `func_1` and the lists of integers it is called with.

### What is Printed:
The `print` statement will join all elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`), and then print this string.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` and the lists of integers it is called with are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in `results`. However, we know that `results` contains `t` elements, and each element is a string (assuming `func_1` returns a string).

### Final Output:
Output: **[result_1]
[result_2]
...
[result_t] (where each [result_i] is the result of calling `func_1` on a list of integers, and there are `t` such results)**

This format indicates that the output will be a series of `t` lines, each containing the result of a function call `func_1` on a list of integers.
