### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. It does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the allowed operation of splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them.

Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step using the annotated code:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - **Initial State:** `arr` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq \text{len}(arr) \leq 50\).
   - **First Check:** The function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`.
     - If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
     - If the array is not already sorted, it proceeds to the next check.
   - **Second Check:** The function checks if there is any pair of consecutive elements where the first element is greater than the second using the condition `any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`.
     - If such a pair exists, it returns 'No'.
     - If no such pair exists, it returns 'Yes'.

   The issue here is that the second check is redundant because if the array is not already sorted, the first check will fail, and the function will return 'No'. The function does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the allowed operation.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - **Initial State:** `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), and `arr` is a list of \(n\) integers such that \(1 \leq \text{arr}[i] \leq 10^6\).
   - **Input Handling:** The function reads all input at once and processes it.
   - **Loop for Test Cases:** For each test case, it:
     - Extracts the length of the array `n`.
     - Extracts the array `arr` of length `n`.
     - Calls `func_1` with `arr` to determine if the array can be sorted.
     - Appends the result to the `results` list.
   - **Output:** After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

### Example Analysis:
Consider the example array:
```
7 9 2 2 3
```
- **Current Behavior of `func_1`:**
  - The array is not sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - The function returns 'No' because it only checks if the array is already sorted.

- **Expected Behavior:**
  - The array can be sorted by performing the operations:
    1. Split the array into `x = [7]` and `y = [9, 2, 2, 3]`, then swap to get `[9, 2, 2, 3, 7]`.
    2. Split the array into `x = [9]` and `y = [2, 2, 3, 7]`, then swap to get `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`.
  - The correct output for this case should be "Yes".

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` is not correctly implementing the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by performing the allowed operation. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient for the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
