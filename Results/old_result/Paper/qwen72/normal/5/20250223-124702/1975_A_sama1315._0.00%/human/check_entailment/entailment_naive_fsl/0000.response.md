Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, it does not correctly handle the operation described in the problem, which involves splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them to check if the array can be sorted. The function only checks if the array is already sorted and does not consider the possibility of sorting the array through the allowed operation.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
7 9 2 2 3
```
According to the problem description, this array can be sorted by performing the operations:
1. Split the array into `x = [7]` and `y = [9, 2, 2, 3]`, then swap to get `[9, 2, 2, 3, 7]`.
2. Split the array into `x = [9]` and `y = [2, 2, 3, 7]`, then swap to get `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`.

The correct output for this case should be "Yes", but `func_1` will return "No" because it only checks if the array is already sorted and does not consider the possibility of sorting through the allowed operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
