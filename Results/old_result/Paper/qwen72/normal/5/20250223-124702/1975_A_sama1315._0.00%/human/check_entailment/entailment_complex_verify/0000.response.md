Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order and does not consider the possibility of sorting the array through the allowed operation of splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix. This is a significant oversight because the problem specifically allows for the array to be split and swapped to achieve a sorted state.

To illustrate, let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
```
5
7 9 2 2 3
```
The function `func_1` will return "No" because it checks if the array is already sorted and finds that it is not. However, as the problem description indicates, this array can indeed be sorted by performing the operations:
1. Split the array into `x = [7]` and `y = [9, 2, 2, 3]`, then swap to get `[9, 2, 2, 3, 7]`.
2. Split the array into `x = [9]` and `y = [2, 2, 3, 7]`, then swap to get `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`.

Since `func_1` does not account for these operations, it incorrectly returns "No" for cases where the array can be sorted through the allowed operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
