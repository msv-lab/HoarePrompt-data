You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` positive integers.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation any number of times.
   - The operation involves splitting the array into a prefix `x` and a suffix `y`, and then swapping them to form `y + x`.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - `func_1(arr)` checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No' if there is any element that is greater than the next element.
   - However, this function does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the swap operation.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - `func_2()` reads input from `sys.stdin.read` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It splits the input into a list of strings and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it extracts the length `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It calls `func_1(arr)` to check if the array can be sorted.
   - It appends the result to a list `results` and prints all results at the end.

4. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the swap operation.
   - Therefore, `func_1` is incorrect for the given problem because it does not handle the required operation.

5. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` correctly reads and processes multiple test cases.
   - It uses `func_1` to determine if the array can be sorted, but since `func_1` is incorrect, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results for some test cases.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because `func_1` does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the swap operation. Therefore, the program will fail to correctly determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order for some test cases.

Correctness: **False**
