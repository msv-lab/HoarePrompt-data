The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract multiple sets of integers, and applies a function `func_1` to each set. It then prints the results of these function calls, one per line. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is the last integer value read from the input, `arr` is the last list of integers read from the input, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is equal to the length of `data`, and `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the result of calling `func_1` on a list of integers.
