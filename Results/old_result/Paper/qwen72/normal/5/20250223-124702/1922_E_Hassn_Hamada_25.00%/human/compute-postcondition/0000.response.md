Output State: **The function is defined but not executed, so the values of `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged. The function is expected to return an integer representing the size of the generated sequence, but this has not yet occurred.**

The function definition does not change the values of the variables `number` and `sequence`. The function is designed to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input `number` and return the size of this sequence, but since the function is not called, no changes are made to the variables or the sequence. The initial state remains valid, and the function is ready to be called with the provided arguments.
