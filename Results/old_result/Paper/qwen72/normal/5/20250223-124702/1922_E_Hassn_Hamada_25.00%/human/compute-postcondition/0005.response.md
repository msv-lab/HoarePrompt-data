To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - The variables in the loop condition are `size` and `number`.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `size` is 1.
   - `number` is not equal to 0.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`.
   - Let's break this down:
     - `1 << size + 1` is a bitwise left shift operation. For `size = 1`, this becomes `1 << 2`, which is `4`.
     - So, the condition simplifies to `4 - 1 <= number`, which is `3 <= number`.

4. **Determine the Necessary Adjustment:**
   - For the loop to execute, `3 <= number` must be true.
   - Given that `number` is not equal to 0, it can be any positive integer or negative integer except 0.
   - To ensure the loop executes, `number` must be at least 3.

### Conclusion:
- The state of `number` needs to be adjusted to ensure that `number` is at least 3.

### Final State:
State: **The function is defined but not executed, so the values of `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged. `number` must be greater than or equal to 3. `size` is now 1.**
