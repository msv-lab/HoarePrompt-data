#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a loop or context where the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) is provided, and for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` are provided, where each string consists of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        
        print(l)
        
    #State: The value of `l` will be 'NO' after the loop executes all iterations, assuming the loop completes without any interruptions. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the same as their final values after the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`. It checks if for each character position `i` in the strings, at least one of the characters in `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches the character in `c[i]`. If this condition is met for all positions, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the final state of the program is that the value of `l` will be 'NO' if any test case failed the condition, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the same as their final values after the last iteration of the loop.
