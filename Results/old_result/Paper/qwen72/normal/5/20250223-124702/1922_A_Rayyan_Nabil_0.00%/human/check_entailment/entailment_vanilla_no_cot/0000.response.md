Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the logic of determining whether a template exists that matches both `a` and `b` but does not match `c`. The program incorrectly sets `l` to 'YES' for each character position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are not equal to `c[i]`, but it does not check if `a` and `b` can actually match the same template. Additionally, the `else` block is not properly placed to ensure that the final decision is made after checking all positions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        
        # Check if a and b can match the same template
        can_match = True
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != b[i]:
                can_match = False
                break
        
        # If a and b can match the same template, check if c can also match it
        if can_match:
            for i in range(n):
                if a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i]:
                    print("NO")
                    break
            else:
                print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Check if `a` and `b` can match the same template:**
   - For each position `i`, if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `a` and `b` cannot match the same template, and we set `can_match` to `False` and break out of the loop.

2. **Check if `c` can match the template:**
   - If `a` and `b` can match the same template, we then check if `c` can also match it.
   - For each position `i`, if `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then `c` matches the template, and we print "NO" and break out of the loop.
   - If we finish the loop without finding a matching position, we print "YES".

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly determines whether there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it, but `c` does not.
