Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here is the analysis:

1. **Variable Naming and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` correctly.
   - However, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are incorrectly named. According to the problem description, the input should be `n`, `a`, and `b` where `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts on promotion. The program should read these variables as `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic for Calculating Minimum Cost**:
   - The program calculates `d = c / 2`, which is incorrect because `c` should be `b` (the promotion price for two yogurts).
   - The condition `if a * b < a * d:` is incorrect. It should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price with the cost of buying them at the promotion price.
   - The program should calculate the minimum cost by considering the number of pairs of yogurts and the remaining single yogurts.

3. **Correct Logic**:
   - Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought: `pairs = n // 2`.
   - Calculate the cost of buying these pairs at the promotion price: `promotion_cost = pairs * b`.
   - Calculate the number of remaining single yogurts: `remaining = n % 2`.
   - Calculate the cost of buying the remaining single yogurts at the regular price: `regular_cost = remaining * a`.
   - The total minimum cost is the sum of the promotion cost and the regular cost: `total_cost = promotion_cost + regular_cost`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        promotion_cost = pairs * b
        regular_cost = remaining * a
        total_cost = promotion_cost + regular_cost
        print(total_cost)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program will correctly determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the given prices.
