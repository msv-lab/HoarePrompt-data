### Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This is essential for handling multiple test cases as described in the problem.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If both `a` and `c` contain only one unique value and that value is the same, the function prints 0. This is correct because the total difference \( D \) will be 0 if all elements are the same.
   - If `a` contains only one element, the function prints the maximum absolute difference between that element and the maximum or minimum element of `c`. This is also correct because the maximum difference for a single element is achieved by comparing it to the extreme values in `c`.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The function sorts `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order. This is a good strategy to maximize the absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two lists.

4. **Difference Calculation**:
   - The function uses a loop to calculate the maximum possible sum of absolute differences. It compares the absolute difference between the smallest remaining element of `a` and the largest remaining element of `c` (`t1`) with the absolute difference between the largest remaining element of `a` and the smallest remaining element of `c` (`t2`).
   - It then adds the larger of these two differences to the total sum `ans` and updates the indices `i` and `j` accordingly. This ensures that the differences are maximized at each step.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is the correct way to handle the output as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning above, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles special cases, sorts the lists appropriately, and calculates the maximum total difference \( D \) correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:
**True**
