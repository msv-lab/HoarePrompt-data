Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks if the difference between the sum of the elements and the last element, adjusted for each non-zero element, is zero. This does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

A correct approach would involve checking if the average amount of water (which is the sum of all elements divided by the number of containers) can be achieved by pouring water from any container to any other container with a higher index. The program should verify if the total amount of water can be evenly distributed among all containers, and if so, ensure that the distribution can be achieved by the allowed operations.

Here is a case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
3
1 2 3

Output (expected):
YES

Output (actual):
NO
```
In this case, the sum of the elements is 6, and the average is 2. By pouring 1 unit of water from the third container to the first, all containers will have 2 units of water, which should result in "YES". However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO".
