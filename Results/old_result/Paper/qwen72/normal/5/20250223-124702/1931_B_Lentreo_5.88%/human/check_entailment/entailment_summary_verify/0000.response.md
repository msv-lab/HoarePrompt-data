### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Equal Distribution:**
   - The program calculates the difference between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element of `nums`, summing these differences. This approach is fundamentally flawed because it does not consider the average amount of water that each container should have.
   - The correct approach involves checking if the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n` (which is guaranteed in the problem statement) and then verifying if it is possible to make all elements equal to this average value using the allowed operations.

2. **Allowed Operations:**
   - The allowed operations are to pour any amount of water from the i-th container to the j-th container, where \( i < j \). This means water can only be poured from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index.
   - The program does not implement this logic. Instead, it only checks the difference between each non-zero element and the last element, which does not ensure that the water can be evenly distributed using the allowed operations.

3. **Example Case:**
   - The provided example case:
     ```
     Input:
     1
     3
     1 2 3

     Output (expected):
     YES

     Output (actual):
     NO
     ```
   - In this case, the sum of the elements is 6, and the average is 2. By pouring 1 unit of water from the third container to the first, all containers will have 2 units of water, which should result in "YES". However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it does not check the average value or the feasibility of the operations.

### Correct Approach:

A correct approach would involve the following steps:
1. Calculate the average amount of water each container should have.
2. Verify if it is possible to make all containers have this average amount of water by pouring water from any container to any other container with a higher index.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_water = sum(nums)
        target = total_water // n  # Calculate the target amount of water per container
        possible = True
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if nums[i] > target:
                nums[i + 1] += nums[i] - target
                nums[i] = target
            if nums[i] < target:
                possible = False
                break
        if possible and nums[-1] == target:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not solve the problem as described and fails to handle the test cases correctly.

Final: **False**
