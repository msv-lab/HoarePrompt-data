### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common technique for handling multiple test cases efficiently.
   - The first element of the list is the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It first creates a sorted set of unique characters from the encoded string `b`. This ensures that the characters are in alphabetical order.
   - It then creates a dictionary `char_map` where each unique character is mapped to its corresponding character in reverse order. For example, if `b` contains the characters `['a', 'b', 'c']`, the dictionary will be `{'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}`.
   - The function then decodes the string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results of decoding for each test case and prints them one by one.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them in alphabetical order.
   - The mapping of characters is done correctly, ensuring that the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on.
   - The decoding process is also correct, as it uses the `char_map` to replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
