Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly decode the encoded string based on the provided problem description. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input in a loop, reading the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case (length `n` and the encoded string `b`).

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It creates a sorted set of unique characters from the encoded string, which forms the auxiliary string `r`.
   - It then creates a character mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (first to last, second to second last, etc.).
   - Finally, it decodes the string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the mapping.

3. **Output**:
   - The decoded strings are collected in a list `results` and printed one by one.

The program follows the encoding and decoding logic as described in the problem. It correctly handles the test cases provided in the example, and the execution summary confirms that the function behaves as expected.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
