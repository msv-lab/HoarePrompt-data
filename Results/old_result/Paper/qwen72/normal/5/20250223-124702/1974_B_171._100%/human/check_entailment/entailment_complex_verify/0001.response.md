### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input in a loop, extracting the number of test cases `t`, the length of the encoded string `n`, and the encoded string `b` for each test case.
   - The index is incremented appropriately to move through the input data.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The annotations confirm that the input is correctly read and processed. The state of the program before the function call is as expected.

2. **Unique Characters and Sorting:**
   - The program correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string `b` using `set(encoded)`.
   - It sorts these unique characters alphabetically using `sorted(set(encoded))` to form the string `r`.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The annotations confirm that `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`.

3. **Character Mapping:**
   - The program creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
   - The mapping is done correctly by iterating over the sorted unique characters and pairing them with their symmetric counterparts.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The annotations confirm that `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to the corresponding unique character in reverse order.

4. **Decoding:**
   - The program decodes the string `b` by replacing each character with its corresponding character from `char_map`.
   - The decoding process is correct and follows the reverse of the encoding algorithm described in the problem.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The annotations confirm that the `decoded` string is constructed by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly appends the decoded strings to the `results` list and prints them after processing all test cases.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The annotations confirm that the program returns the `decoded` string and prints it correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem. It handles the input and output as required, and the decoding logic is accurate. The annotations support the correctness of each step in the program.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
