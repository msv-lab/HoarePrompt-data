### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input in a loop, extracting the number of test cases `t`, the length of the encoded string `n`, and the encoded string `b` for each test case.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It creates a set of unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorts them alphabetically to form the string `r`.
   - It then creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).
   - Finally, it decodes the string `b` by replacing each character with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program collects the decoded strings in a list `results` and prints them one by one after processing all test cases.

### Step-by-Step Verification:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes it in a loop.
   - The index is incremented appropriately to move through the input data.

2. **Unique Characters and Sorting:**
   - The program correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
   - This step ensures that the string `r` is constructed as required by the problem description.

3. **Character Mapping:**
   - The program creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
   - The mapping is done correctly by iterating over the sorted unique characters and pairing them with their symmetric counterparts.

4. **Decoding:**
   - The program decodes the string `b` by replacing each character with its corresponding character from `char_map`.
   - The decoding process is correct and follows the reverse of the encoding algorithm described in the problem.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly appends the decoded strings to the `results` list and prints them after processing all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem. It handles the input and output as required, and the decoding logic is accurate.

### Correctness:
**True**
