Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is efficient for handling multiple test cases.
   - The variable `index` is used to keep track of the current position in the input list, ensuring that the program correctly processes each test case.

2. **Test Case Loop**:
   - The program iterates over the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the encoded string `b` from the input list.
   - It then calls the `func_1` function to decode the string `b` and appends the result to the `results` list.

3. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It constructs the auxiliary string `r` by taking the unique characters from `b`, sorting them, and storing them in `unique_chars`.
   - It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its symmetric character in reverse order.
   - The function then decodes the string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.
   - The decoded string is returned.

4. **Annotations and State Validation**:
   - Before the function call, `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5.
   - Inside the function, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`.
   - `char_map` is correctly constructed to map each character to its symmetric character in reverse order.
   - The state after constructing `char_map` is as described: `char_map` contains the mappings, and `encoded`, `unique_chars`, and `len_unique` remain unchanged.
   - The `decoded` string is constructed by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles single-character strings correctly.
   - It also handles strings with repeated characters and strings with all unique characters.
   - The program ensures that the characters are mapped correctly even if the number of unique characters is odd.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the decoded strings for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It handles all valid inputs and produces the correct output for each test case.

Final: **True**
