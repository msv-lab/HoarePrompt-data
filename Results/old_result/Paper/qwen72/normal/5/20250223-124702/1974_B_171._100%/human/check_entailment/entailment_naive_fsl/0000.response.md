Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly follows the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It constructs the auxiliary string `r` from the unique, sorted characters of the encoded string `b`, and then creates a mapping where each character in `b` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r`. The program handles multiple test cases and reads input as specified. The logic for decoding is sound, and there are no apparent edge cases or missing logic that would cause the program to fail for any valid input.
