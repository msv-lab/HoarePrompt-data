Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to count the number of trailing zeros in a number. However, it is not used correctly in the main logic. The program should be counting the number of trailing zeros in the reversed numbers, not the original numbers.

2. **Logic for `subtract_zero`**: The logic for `subtract_zero` is incorrect. The idea seems to be to count the number of trailing zeros that can be removed from the total digit count, but the way it is implemented is flawed. The program is summing every other element in the `zeros` list, which is not the correct way to handle trailing zeros.

3. **Winning Condition**: The winning condition is not correctly implemented. The program checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. This is not the correct way to determine the winner. The correct condition should be based on whether the final number can be made to have at least `m` digits.

4. **Output Format**: The output format is incorrect. The program outputs "Sashah" instead of "Sasha".

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test

def count_trailing_zeros(s):
    return len(s) - len(s.rstrip('0'))

for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    max_reversed_digits = 0
    
    for item in array:
        reversed_item = item[::-1].lstrip('0')
        total_digits += len(reversed_item)
        max_reversed_digits = max(max_reversed_digits, len(reversed_item))
    
    if total_digits >= m:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'

for answer in answers:
    print(answer)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Counting Trailing Zeros**: The function `count_trailing_zeros` is used to count the number of trailing zeros in a string. However, in this problem, we don't need to count trailing zeros explicitly. Instead, we reverse the numbers and strip leading zeros to get the correct digit count.

2. **Total Digits**: We calculate the total number of digits in the list after Anna's optimal moves (reversing the numbers).

3. **Max Reversed Digits**: We keep track of the maximum number of digits in any single reversed number. This is important because if any single number has at least `m` digits, Sasha can win by concatenating it with any other number.

4. **Winning Condition**: If the total number of digits in the list after Anna's moves is at least `m`, Sasha can always win by concatenating the numbers to form a number with at least `m` digits. Otherwise, Anna wins.

5. **Output Format**: The output format is corrected to print "Sasha" or "Anna" as required.

This corrected program should now correctly determine the winner for each test case.
