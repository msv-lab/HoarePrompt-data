To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string containing characters '0' and '1'.
   - `n` is the number of '1's in the string `s`.
   - `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' in `s` that is followed by at least one '1'.

2. **Understanding `n`:**
   - `n` is simply the count of '1's in the string `s`.

3. **Understanding `ans`:**
   - For each '0' in the string `s`, we need to check if it is followed by at least one '1'.
   - If a '0' is followed by at least one '1', we add `n + 1` to `ans`.

4. **Example Calculation:**
   - Let's consider an example string `s = "10101"`.
     - `n` is the number of '1's in `s`, which is 3.
     - We iterate through the string to find '0's and check if they are followed by at least one '1':
       - The first '0' is at index 1 and is followed by '1' (at index 2), so we add `n + 1` (3 + 1 = 4) to `ans`.
       - The second '0' is at index 3 and is followed by '1' (at index 4), so we add `n + 1` (3 + 1 = 4) to `ans`.
     - Therefore, `ans` is 4 + 4 = 8.

5. **General Case:**
   - For any string `s`, `ans` will be the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' in `s` that is followed by at least one '1'.
   - If there are no '0's followed by '1's, `ans` will be 0.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` as calculated above.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of n + 1 for each '0' in s that is followed by at least one '1', and n is the number of '1's in the string s)**
