The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate, and it does not need a specific initial value before the loop starts, as it will be assigned values from the range during the loop execution.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
