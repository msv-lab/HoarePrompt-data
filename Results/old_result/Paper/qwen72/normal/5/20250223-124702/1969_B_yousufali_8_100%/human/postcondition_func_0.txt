The function `func_1` reads a binary string `s` from the standard input, where `s` consists of characters '0' and '1' and has a length of at least 2. It then processes the string to calculate a value `ans`, which is the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' in `s` that is followed by at least one '1', where `n` is the number of '1's encountered before the '0'. Finally, the function prints the value of `ans` and does not return any value.
