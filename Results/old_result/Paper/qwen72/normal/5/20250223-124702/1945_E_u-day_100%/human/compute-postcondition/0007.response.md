To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `low + 1 < high`.

Given the program state:
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `n`

The condition `low + 1 < high` translates to `1 < n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.

Since `low` and `high` are the only variables in the loop head, and `low` is already 0, we need to ensure that `high` (which is `n`) is greater than 1.

State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `pos` remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 1, `st` is an empty set.**
