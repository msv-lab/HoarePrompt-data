The function `func` does not accept any input parameters. It reads multiple test cases from the standard input, each containing a single integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). For each test case, it generates a sequence of operations to reduce `X` to 1. If a valid sequence is found, it prints the number of operations required and the sequence itself in reverse order. If no valid sequence can be found, it prints -1. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program is such that the input has been consumed, and the output has been printed to the standard output.
