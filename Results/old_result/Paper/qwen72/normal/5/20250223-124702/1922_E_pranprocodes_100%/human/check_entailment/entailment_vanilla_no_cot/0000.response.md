Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has a fundamental flaw in how it constructs the array to achieve exactly `X` increasing subsequences. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing the Array**:
   - The program attempts to construct the array by alternating between appending the maximum value and the minimum value based on whether `X` is even or odd.
   - This approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic for appending values and decrementing/incrementing `max` and `min` does not align with the combinatorial properties required to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences.

2. **Handling of `X = 1`**:
   - The program does not handle the case where `X = 1` correctly. According to the problem, an array with exactly one increasing subsequence can be trivially constructed (e.g., a single-element array or an array with all elements equal). However, the program does not account for this and will incorrectly output an empty array or an array that does not meet the criteria.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the length of the array and the array itself, but it does not handle the case where no such array exists. The problem description states that if it is impossible to find the required array, the program should print `-1`. The provided solution does not check for this condition and will always attempt to construct an array.

### Correct Approach:

A correct approach would involve constructing an array that ensures the exact number of increasing subsequences. One possible method is to use a binary representation of `X` to construct the array, as the number of increasing subsequences can be related to the number of ways to choose elements from the array.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        if x == 1:
            print(1)
            print(0)
            continue
        
        ans = []
        while x > 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(1)
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(0)
                x = (x - 1) // 2
        
        if x == 1:
            ans.append(0)
        
        ans.reverse()
        n = len(ans)
        print(n)
        print(*ans)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Handling `X = 1`**: If `X` is 1, the program prints a single-element array `[0]` which has exactly one increasing subsequence.
- **Constructing the Array**:
  - The program uses the binary representation of `X` to construct the array. For each bit in the binary representation of `X`, it appends a `1` if the bit is set (i.e., `x % 2 == 0`), and a `0` if the bit is not set (i.e., `x % 2 == 1`).
  - This ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`.
- **Output**: The program prints the length of the array and the array itself, ensuring the correct format and handling the case where `X = 1`.

This corrected program should pass the given test cases and handle the problem correctly.
