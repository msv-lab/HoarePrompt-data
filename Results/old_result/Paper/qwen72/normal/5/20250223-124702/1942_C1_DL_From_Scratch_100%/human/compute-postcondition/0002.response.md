Output State: **The value of `T` is decreased by the number of iterations that have been executed, `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated with the values read from the input for each iteration, and `chosen_vertices` is updated with the list of `x` distinct integers read from the input for each iteration. The loop prints the result of `count + x - 2` for each iteration, where `count` is the number of gaps of size 1 between the sorted `chosen_vertices` plus the gap between the first and last vertex in the sorted list.**
