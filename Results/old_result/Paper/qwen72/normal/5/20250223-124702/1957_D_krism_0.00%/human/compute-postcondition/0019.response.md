Output State: `prefix` remains unchanged. `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist contains the counts of 1s and 0s at the corresponding bit position across all elements in `prefix` from index 1 to `n`. Specifically, `pre[j][1]` is the count of 1s at bit position `j`, and `pre[j][0]` is the count of 0s at bit position `j`. `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist contains the counts of 1s and 0s at the corresponding bit position across all elements in `prefix` from index `n` to 1, but all counts are zeroed out. `ans` is the sum of the products of the counts of 1s and 0s at each bit position across the elements in `arr` from index 0 to `n-1`.
