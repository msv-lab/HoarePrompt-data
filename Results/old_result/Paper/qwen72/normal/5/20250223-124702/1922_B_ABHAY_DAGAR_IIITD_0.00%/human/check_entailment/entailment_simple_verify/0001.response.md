### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `num_list`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length in `num_list`, which is appropriate for this problem.

3. **Calculating the Number of Triangles:**
   - The program initializes `res` to 0, which will store the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle.
   - It also initializes `total_count` to 0, which will keep track of the total number of sticks processed so far.
   - For each unique stick length `cnt` in `num_of_lens`:
     - If `cnt` is at least 3, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula \(\binom{cnt}{3}\) and adds it to `res`. This is correct because if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length, they can form a non-degenerate triangle.
     - If `cnt` is at least 2, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length using the combination formula \(\binom{cnt}{2} \times total_count\) and adds it to `res`. This is incorrect because it does not consider the non-degenerate triangle condition. Specifically, for sticks of lengths \(2^a\), \(2^a\), and \(2^b\) (where \(a \neq b\)), the sum of the two smaller lengths \(2^a + 2^a = 2^{a+1}\) will not be greater than \(2^b\) if \(b > a+1\). Therefore, this calculation can include invalid triangles.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Non-degenerate Triangle Condition:**
  - The program correctly identifies that the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle with sticks of lengths \(2^a\), \(2^b\), and \(2^c\) is if \(a = b = c\). This is because the sum of two smaller powers of 2 will never be greater than a larger power of 2 if they are not equal.
  - However, the program incorrectly includes combinations where two sticks have the same length and one stick has a different length, which can lead to invalid triangles.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly counts the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length to form a non-degenerate triangle. However, it incorrectly counts the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length, which can include invalid triangles. Therefore, the program does not fully adhere to the non-degenerate triangle condition and is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
