Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n, f, k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        f -= 1
        
        k -= 1
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = a[f]
        
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if a[k] > x:
            print('NO')
        elif a[k] < x:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')
        
    #State: The loop has executed all iterations, and the values of t, n, f, k, and a have been processed according to the loop logic. For each iteration, the value of `x` is set to `a[f]` before sorting `a` in descending order. The loop then checks if `a[k]` is greater than, less than, or equal to `x` and prints 'NO', 'YES', or 'MAYBE' accordingly. After all iterations, the values of t, n, f, k, and a are no longer relevant as they are redefined in each iteration. The final output state is the sequence of 'NO', 'YES', or 'MAYBE' printed for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, and `k` (integers), and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then checks if the element at index `f-1` in the original list `a` is greater than, less than, or equal to the element at index `k-1` in the sorted list `a` (in descending order). If the element in the sorted list is greater, it prints 'NO'. If it is less, it prints 'YES'. If they are equal, it prints 'YES' if `k` is the last index of the sorted list or if the element before `k` in the sorted list is less than the original element; otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, and the final state is a sequence of 'NO', 'YES', or 'MAYBE' printed for each test case.
