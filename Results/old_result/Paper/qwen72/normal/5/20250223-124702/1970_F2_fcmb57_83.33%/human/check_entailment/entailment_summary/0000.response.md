Reasoning:  
The provided Python program has a logical error in the `func_1` function. The function `func_1` is supposed to handle the movement of players and the Quaffle on the grid. However, the function expects `b` to be a tuple of two integers (dx, dy), but the `mouvements` dictionary provides tuples where the first element is the change in the x-coordinate and the second element is the change in the y-coordinate. The function `func_1` incorrectly unpacks `b` as if it were a single integer, leading to a `ValueError`.

Additionally, the program has a few other issues:
1. The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be an assignment (`=`) instead of a comparison (`==`).
2. The program does not handle the case where a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle correctly. It should ensure that the Quaffle remains on the cell where the player was eliminated.
3. The program does not handle the movement of the Bludger correctly. The Bludger is represented as `.B` in the input, but the program does not move it or check for collisions with players.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the rules and logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
