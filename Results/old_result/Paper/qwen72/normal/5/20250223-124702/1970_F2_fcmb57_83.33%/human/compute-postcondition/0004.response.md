Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both expected to be integers. However, the function attempts to unpack `a` into `x` and `y`, and `b` into `dx` and `dy`. Since `b` is an integer and cannot be unpacked, the function results in a `ValueError` and does not return any value. **
