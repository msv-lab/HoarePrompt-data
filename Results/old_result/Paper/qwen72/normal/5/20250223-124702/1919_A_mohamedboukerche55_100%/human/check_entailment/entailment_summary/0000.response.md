Reasoning:  
The program's logic is based on the parity (even or odd) of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight here is that the game can be reduced to a simple parity check because of the turn-based nature and the rules of the game. If the sum of the coins is even, the game will always end with Bob winning, and if the sum is odd, Alice will always win. This is because the game essentially reduces to a series of moves where each player can either swap or not swap, and then remove one coin. The player who starts with an odd total number of coins in both wallets will always be able to make the last move, and the player who starts with an even total will be the one who cannot make the last move.

The program correctly implements this logic by:
1. Reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, reading the number of coins `a` and `b`.
3. Checking if the sum `(a + b)` is even or odd.
4. Printing 'Bob' if the sum is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd.

This approach is valid and matches the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
