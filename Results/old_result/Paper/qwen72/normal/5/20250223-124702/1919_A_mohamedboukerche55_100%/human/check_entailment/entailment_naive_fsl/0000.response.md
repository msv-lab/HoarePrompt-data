Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly determine the winner based on the game rules. The logic in the program is based on the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets being even or odd, which does not accurately reflect the game's dynamics. Specifically, the game involves strategic decisions about swapping and removing coins, and the outcome depends on the parity of the number of moves each player can make, not just the sum of their coins.

A counterexample is when Alice has 2 coins and Bob has 1 coin:
- Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob, leaving Alice with 1 coin and Bob with 2 coins.
- Bob then removes a coin from his wallet, leaving him with 1 coin.
- Alice removes a coin from her wallet, leaving her with 0 coins.
- Bob cannot make a move because Alice's wallet is empty, so Alice wins.

However, the program would incorrectly output "Bob" in this case because (2 + 1) % 2 == 1, which is odd. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
