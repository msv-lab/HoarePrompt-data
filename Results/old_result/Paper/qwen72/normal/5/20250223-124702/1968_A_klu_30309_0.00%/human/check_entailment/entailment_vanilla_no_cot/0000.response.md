Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(x)` is designed to find the integer `y` (1 â‰¤ y < x) that maximizes the value of `gcd(x, y) + y`.

2. **Initialization**: The variable `max_val` is initialized to 1. This is a reasonable starting point because the smallest possible `y` is 1, and `gcd(x, 1) + 1 = 2`.

3. **Loop**: The loop iterates from `x - 1` down to 2. This is because `y` must be less than `x` and greater than 1.

4. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, the program checks if `x % y == 0`. This condition ensures that `y` is a divisor of `x`, which means `gcd(x, y) = y`.

5. **Optimization**: If `2 * y >= x`, the function immediately returns `y`. This is because if `y` is a divisor of `x` and `2 * y >= x`, then `y` is the largest possible divisor of `x` that is less than `x`, and `gcd(x, y) + y` will be maximized.

6. **Fallback**: If no `y` satisfies the condition `2 * y >= x`, the function returns the largest divisor found during the loop, which is stored in `max_val`.

7. **Input Handling**: The main part of the program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by calling `func_1(x)` and printing the result.

This approach ensures that the program finds the optimal `y` for each `x` within the given constraints. The logic is sound and should produce the correct results for the given problem.
