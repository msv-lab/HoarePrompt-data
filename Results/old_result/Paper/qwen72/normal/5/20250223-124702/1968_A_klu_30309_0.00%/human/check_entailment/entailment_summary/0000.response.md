Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to find an integer `y` (1 â‰¤ y < x) such that the value of `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized. The function iterates from `x - 1` down to 2, checking if `y` divides `x` evenly (i.e., `x % y == 0`). If it finds such a `y` and `2 * y >= x`, it immediately returns `y`. If no such `y` is found, it returns 1.

### Analysis:
1. **GCD Calculation**: The function implicitly uses the fact that if `y` divides `x` evenly, then `gcd(x, y) = y`. This is because `y` is a divisor of `x`, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is `y` itself.

2. **Maximizing `gcd(x, y) + y`**: Since `gcd(x, y) = y` when `y` divides `x` evenly, the expression `gcd(x, y) + y` simplifies to `y + y = 2 * y`. The function is looking for the largest `y` such that `2 * y >= x`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `x` is a prime number, the only divisor of `x` other than `x` itself is 1. In this case, the function will return 1, which is correct because `gcd(x, 1) + 1 = 2` is the maximum possible value for `y = 1`.
   - If `x` is not a prime number, the function will find the largest divisor `y` of `x` that is less than `x` and check if `2 * y >= x`. If this condition is met, it returns `y`, which is correct because `2 * y` will be the largest possible value of `gcd(x, y) + y`.

4. **Optimization**: The function starts from `x - 1` and iterates downwards, which ensures that the first `y` found that divides `x` evenly and satisfies `2 * y >= x` is the largest possible `y` that meets the criteria.

5. **Output**: The function returns the correct `y` for each test case, as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the integer `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` for the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
