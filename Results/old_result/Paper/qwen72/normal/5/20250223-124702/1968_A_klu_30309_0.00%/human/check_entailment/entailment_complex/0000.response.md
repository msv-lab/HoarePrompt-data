### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find this \( y \).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates over possible values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
   - It checks if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \) (i.e., \( x \% y == 0 \)).
   - If \( y \) is a divisor and \( 2 \times y \ge x \), it immediately returns \( y \).
   - If no such \( y \) is found, it returns the largest \( y \) that is a divisor of \( x \) and is less than \( x \), or 1 if no such \( y \) exists.

3. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The function correctly identifies the largest \( y \) that is a divisor of \( x \) and is less than \( x \).
   - The condition \( 2 \times y \ge x \) ensures that \( y \) is at least half of \( x \), which is a good candidate for maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) because \( \gcd(x, y) \) will be \( y \) itself when \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \).
   - If no \( y \) satisfies \( 2 \times y \ge x \), the function returns the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \), which is also a valid candidate for maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and the function correctly returns 1.
   - For \( x = 10 \), the function returns 5, which is correct because \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \), and this is the maximum possible value.
   - For \( x = 7 \), the function returns 6, which is incorrect because 6 is not a divisor of 7. The correct \( y \) should be 1, as \( \gcd(7, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_1` does not always return the correct \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - Specifically, it fails when \( x \) is a prime number or has no divisors that satisfy \( 2 \times y \ge x \).

### Correctness:
**False**

The function `func_1` does not always return the correct \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). It fails for prime numbers and other cases where no divisors satisfy \( 2 \times y \ge x \).
