### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and the value \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) is the largest integer that divides both \( x \) and \( y \) without leaving a remainder.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case by reading an integer \( x \).
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for finding the optimal \( y \) for a given \( x \).

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes `max_val` to 1, which is the smallest possible value for \( y \).
   - It then iterates over possible values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
   - For each \( y \), it checks if \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) (i.e., \( x \% y == 0 \)).
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \), it checks if \( 2 * y \ge x \). If true, it returns \( y \) immediately.
   - If \( 2 * y < x \), it updates `max_val` to \( y \) but continues the loop.

4. **Key Observations**:
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \), then \( \gcd(x, y) = y \).
   - The expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) simplifies to \( y + y = 2y \).
   - If \( 2y \ge x \), then \( y \) is the largest possible divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \), and it maximizes \( 2y \).
   - If no such \( y \) is found, the function returns the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \) and satisfies \( 2y < x \).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2 \), which is the maximum possible value.
   - For \( x = 3 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \( \gcd(3, 1) + 1 = 2 \), which is the maximum possible value.
   - For \( x = 4 \), the possible \( y \) values are 1 and 2. \( \gcd(4, 2) + 2 = 4 \), which is the maximum possible value.
   - For \( x = 10 \), the possible \( y \) values are 1, 2, 5. \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10 \), which is the maximum possible value.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases and the general case.
   - The logic of finding the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \) and checking if \( 2y \ge x \) ensures that the maximum possible value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is found.
   - The program returns the correct \( y \) for each test case based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
