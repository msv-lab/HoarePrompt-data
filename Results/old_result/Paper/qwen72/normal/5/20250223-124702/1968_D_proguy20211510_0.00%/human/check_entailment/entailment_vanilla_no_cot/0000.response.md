Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in how it handles the game's progression and scoring. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that once a player reaches the maximum value in the array `a`, they will always stay at that position and accumulate the same maximum score for the remaining turns. This is not necessarily true, as the game rules allow a player to either stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation `p`.

Here's a detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Maximum Score**:
   - The program checks if the current position of a player has the maximum value in the array `a` and, if so, assumes the player will stay at that position for the remaining turns, accumulating the maximum score each turn. This is incorrect because the player can choose to move to another position, which might not be the maximum score position.
   - The logic for appending `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to the score lists `b` and `s` is flawed. It assumes that the player will always stay at the maximum score position for the remaining turns, which is not guaranteed by the game rules.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**:
   - The program calculates the scores for each turn and then tries to project the scores for the remaining turns. However, this projection is based on the incorrect assumption that the player will always stay at the maximum score position.
   - The correct approach would be to simulate the game for `k` turns and keep track of the scores for each player, considering the possibility of moving to the position indicated by the permutation `p` or staying at the current position.

3. **Inefficient and Incorrect Use of Precomputed Scores**:
   - The program uses precomputed scores (`preb` and `pres`) and then tries to project the scores for the remaining turns using `ptsb` and `ptss`. This is unnecessary and incorrect because the game's outcome depends on the actual moves made by the players, not just the maximum score in the array `a`.

To correct the program, you should simulate the game for exactly `k` turns, keeping track of the scores for each player and considering the moves they can make at each turn. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        def simulate_game(start_pos, k, p, a):
            score = 0
            current_pos = start_pos
            for _ in range(k):
                score += a[current_pos - 1]
                current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
            return score
        
        bodya_score = simulate_game(pb, k, p, a)
        sasha_score = simulate_game(ps, k, p, a)
        
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

# Example usage:
func()
```

This corrected version simulates the game for both players for exactly `k` turns and correctly determines the winner based on the final scores.
