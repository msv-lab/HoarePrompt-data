The only objects in the loop head are the variables `num` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `num` starts at 1 and will iterate up to `n` (inclusive).

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `num` starts at 1.

State: **`count_a` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a`, and the value associated with each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`. The list `a` remains unchanged. `max_score` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `num` is 1**
