The only objects in the loop head are the list `a` and the variable `num`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `count_a` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- Each integer `a_i` in `a` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`.
- Each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times.
- `count_a` is an empty dictionary.

To ensure the loop executes, `a` must have at least one element. The variable `num` will be the first element of the list `a` at the start of the loop.

State: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n` (where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) and must have at least one element, `num` is the first element of `a`**
