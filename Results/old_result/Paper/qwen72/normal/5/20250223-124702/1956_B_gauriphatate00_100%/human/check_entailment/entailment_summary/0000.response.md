Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can score in a card game against Nene, who plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The key to solving this problem is understanding that:

1. You and Nene each have `n` cards, and the total number of cards is `2n`.
2. Each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice in the deck.
3. You score a point if you play a card that matches a card already on the table.
4. Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

Given these rules, the optimal strategy for you is to play a card that has a duplicate in your hand only if it is not already on the table. This is because if you play a card that is already on the table, you will score a point, but Nene will also have the opportunity to play the matching card and score a point. If you play a card that has a duplicate in your hand and it is not on the table, you can ensure that you will score a point when you play the second card, and Nene will not be able to score a point from that card.

The function `func_1` counts the number of integers in your hand that appear exactly twice. This count represents the maximum number of points you can score if you play optimally, because for each integer that appears twice in your hand, you can score one point when you play the second card.

However, the function does not consider the cards in Nene's hand, which is a critical oversight. Nene's optimal play could affect the number of points you can score. For example, if Nene has a card that matches one of your cards, she will play it immediately after you play the first card to prevent you from scoring a point with the second card.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should take into account the cards in Nene's hand and the optimal play strategy. The function should count the number of integers in your hand that appear exactly twice and ensure that Nene does not have the matching card to play immediately after you.

Given the current implementation of `func_1`, it does not handle the optimal play strategy correctly. It only counts the number of duplicates in your hand, which is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of points you can score.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
