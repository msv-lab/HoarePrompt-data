Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem by calculating the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.

2. **Counting Cards**: The function `func_1` creates a dictionary `count_a` to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand. This is necessary to determine how many pairs of cards you have.

3. **Calculating Maximum Score**: The function iterates through each integer from 1 to `n` and checks if it appears twice in your hand. If it does, you can score a point by playing the second card after the first one. This is because Nene will play her cards optimally to maximize her score, and you can only score points if you have a pair of the same card and Nene hasn't played her card with the same integer yet.

4. **Output**: The program collects the results for each test case and prints them at the end.

The logic and implementation are correct for the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
