### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game is played with a deck of 2n cards, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
   - The cards are distributed such that each player (you and Nene) gets n cards.
   - The goal is to maximize your score while Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - If you have a card with an integer that appears exactly twice in your hand, you can score a point by playing the second card after Nene has played the first card.
   - If you have a card with an integer that appears only once in your hand, you cannot score a point for that card because Nene will play the second card before you do.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of integers in your hand that appear exactly twice.
   - This count directly corresponds to the maximum number of points you can score because for each integer that appears twice in your hand, you can score one point by playing the second card after Nene has played the first card.

4. **Program Structure:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` in your hand.
   - It calls `func_1` to compute the maximum score for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

5. **Function Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of each integer in your hand using a dictionary `count_a`.
   - It then iterates through all integers from 1 to n and increments `max_score` for each integer that appears exactly twice in your hand.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where an integer appears only once in your hand by not incrementing `max_score`.
   - The function also handles the case where an integer does not appear in your hand at all (i.e., it is in Nene's hand).

7. **Output Verification:**
   - The output of the function matches the expected results for the given examples:
     - For the first test case, you have two 1s, so you can score 1 point.
     - For the second test case, you have two 8s and two 5s, so you can score 2 points.
     - For the third test case, you have two 4s, so you can score 1 point.
     - For the fourth test case, you have no card that appears twice, so you score 0 points.
     - For the fifth test case, you have one 1, so you score 0 points.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score by taking your turns optimally, given that Nene plays optimally as well. The function `func_1` accurately counts the number of integers in your hand that appear exactly twice, which is the correct approach to solving the problem.
