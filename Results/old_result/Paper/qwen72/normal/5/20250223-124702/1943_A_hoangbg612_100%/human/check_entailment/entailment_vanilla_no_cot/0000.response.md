Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the MEX by iterating through the sorted list and checking if the current number is greater than the last seen number. However, it does not correctly handle the case where Bob can influence the MEX by removing elements that Alice might need to maximize the MEX.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Optimal Play**: The program does not consider the optimal moves for both Alice and Bob. Alice should always try to pick the smallest missing number that can contribute to the MEX, while Bob should try to prevent Alice from doing so by removing the smallest available number that Alice hasn't picked yet.

3. **Handling of Counts**: The program uses a dictionary `M` to count occurrences of numbers, but it does not correctly handle the logic for determining the MEX after all elements have been processed.

4. **Final MEX Calculation**: The final MEX calculation logic is flawed. The program increments `cur` by 1 if the sum of counts equals `S`, which is not a valid way to determine the MEX.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following:

- **Alice's Strategy**: Alice will always try to pick the smallest number that is not yet in `c` and is available in `a`.
- **Bob's Strategy**: Bob will try to pick the smallest number that is available in `a` to prevent Alice from picking it.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        
        # Initialize the MEX to 0
        mex = 0
        
        # Use a set to keep track of elements in c
        c = set()
        
        # Simulate the game
        for i in range(S):
            if i % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
                for num in N:
                    if num not in c:
                        c.add(num)
                        N.remove(num)
                        break
            else:  # Bob's turn
                for num in N:
                    if num not in c:
                        N.remove(num)
                        break
        
        # Calculate the MEX of c
        while mex in c:
            mex += 1
        
        print(mex)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program simulates the game by alternating turns between Alice and Bob, ensuring that both players play optimally. It then calculates the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.
