### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.

2. **Sorting Check Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version.
   - This function is correct and does not modify the input list `lst`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the array `list1` and checks if the current element is greater than the previous element.
   - If the current element is smaller than the previous element and the previous element is greater than or equal to 10, it performs the operation of splitting the previous element into its digits and inserting them back into the array.
   - However, the program only performs this operation once for each pair of elements. It does not continue to check the array after the operation, which could lead to incorrect results if further operations are needed.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array is already sorted.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the array contains elements less than 10, as these elements cannot be split further.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not ensure that the array is fully sorted after performing the operation. It only checks the immediate next element after the split.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. After splitting `12` into `[1, 2, 28, 5]`, the program does not check if further splits are needed to sort the array. The array remains unsorted, and the program incorrectly prints `NO`.

### Conclusion:
The program is **incorrect** because it does not fully ensure that the array is sorted after performing the operations. It only checks the immediate next element, which is insufficient for ensuring the array is sorted in all cases.

### Correctness:
**False**
