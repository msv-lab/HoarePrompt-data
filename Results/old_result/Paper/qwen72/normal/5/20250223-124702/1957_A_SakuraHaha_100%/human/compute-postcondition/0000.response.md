Output State: **The function should take three parameters: t, a list of n values, and a list of stick lengths a. t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. n is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of sticks. a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, representing the lengths of the sticks.**
