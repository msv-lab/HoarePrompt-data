To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), representing the number of test cases.
   - `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), representing the number of sticks.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\), representing the lengths of the sticks.
   - `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is a unique length from the list `a`, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that length appears in the list `a`.
   - `ans` is the sum of the integer division of each count in `cnt` by 3.

2. **Understanding `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is a dictionary that maps each unique stick length to the number of times it appears in the list `a`.
   - For example, if `a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]`, then `cnt` would be:
     ```python
     cnt = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4}
     ```

3. **Calculating `ans`:**
   - `ans` is calculated by summing the integer division of each count in `cnt` by 3.
   - For the example `cnt` above:
     - `cnt[1] // 3 = 1 // 3 = 0`
     - `cnt[2] // 3 = 2 // 3 = 0`
     - `cnt[3] // 3 = 3 // 3 = 1`
     - `cnt[4] // 3 = 4 // 3 = 1`
   - Summing these results: `0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2`
   - Therefore, `ans` would be 2 in this example.

4. **General Case:**
   - For any given `a`, the dictionary `cnt` will be constructed by counting the occurrences of each unique length.
   - The value of `ans` will be the sum of the integer division of each count in `cnt` by 3.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the integer division of each count in `cnt` by 3.

Given the initial state and the operations, the output will be the calculated value of `ans` based on the counts of stick lengths in the list `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the integer division of each count in cnt by 3, and cnt is a dictionary mapping each unique stick length to its count in the list a)**
