#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t, a list of n values, and a list of stick lengths a. t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of sticks, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` remains an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. `n` remains an integer where 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of sticks. `a` remains a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, representing the lengths of the sticks, and is unchanged. `ans` remains 0. `cnt` is now a dictionary where each key is a unique length from the list `a`, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that length appears in the list `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: `t` remains an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. `n` remains an integer where 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of sticks. `a` remains a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, representing the lengths of the sticks, and is unchanged. `ans` is now the sum of the integer division of each count in `cnt` by 3. `cnt` is now a dictionary where each key is a unique length from the list `a`, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that length appears in the list `a`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the integer division of each count in `cnt` by 3.
    #
    #Given the initial state and the operations, the output will be the calculated value of `ans` based on the counts of stick lengths in the list `a`.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `n` from user input, representing the number of sticks, and a list of `n` integers `a` from user input, representing the lengths of the sticks. The function then calculates the number of groups of three sticks that have the same length and prints this count. After the function concludes, `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and the program state includes the printed count of such groups.
