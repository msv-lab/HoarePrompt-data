The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 50000 and 1 <= k <= floor(n/2). `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n, with each integer from 1 to n appearing exactly twice.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters. However, the specific output for each case is not provided in the constraints and relationships. Therefore, the functionality of the function is described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. It processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n` and an integer `k` within specified ranges, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
