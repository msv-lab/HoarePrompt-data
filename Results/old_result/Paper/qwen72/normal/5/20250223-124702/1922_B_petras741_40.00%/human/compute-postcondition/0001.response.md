Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and the function still takes two parameters: `t` and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents of the lengths of the sticks. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `buffer` is an empty list.**
