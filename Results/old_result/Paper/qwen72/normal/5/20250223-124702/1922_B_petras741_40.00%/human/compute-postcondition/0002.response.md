To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0, and `i` will start at 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `buffer` is an empty list.

The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already specified to be between 1 and 10^4, it meets the condition for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the `range(t)` function.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `t` is within the specified range and `i` is 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list**
