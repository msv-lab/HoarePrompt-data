Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents of the lengths of the sticks. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def count_triangle_ways(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing the integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` for a test case.
