### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires constructing a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum is `k` and the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR is maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - The first element `nums[0]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`. This ensures that the first number has the maximum number of 1s possible.
   - The remaining sum `k` is then reduced by the value of `nums[0]`.
   - For each subsequent element in the sequence, if `k` is still greater than 0, the element is set to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`. This ensures that the next number is as large as possible without exceeding the remaining sum.
   - Finally, any remaining value of `k` is added to `nums[0]` to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - **Sum Condition:** The sum of the sequence is maintained by subtracting the values assigned to each element from `k` and adding any remaining value back to `nums[0]`. This ensures that the sum of the sequence is always `k`.
   - **Maximizing 1s in Binary Representation:** By setting the first element to the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`, and then distributing the remaining sum as large as possible, the solution ensures that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR is maximized.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `n = 1`, the function correctly returns `[k]` because the only element in the sequence must be `k`.
   - If `k` is very small compared to `n`, the function will distribute the sum as evenly as possible, ensuring that the number of 1s in the binary representation is maximized.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The solution is efficient and works within the given constraints. It constructs the sequence in linear time relative to `n`.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).

- **Inside `func_1` function:**
  - `nums = [0] * n`: Initializes a list of `n` zeros.
  - `nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`: Sets the first element to the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`. This is correct because it ensures the maximum number of 1s in the binary representation.
  - `k -= nums[0]`: Reduces the remaining sum by the value of `nums[0]`.
  - `for i in range(1, n)`: Iterates over the remaining elements.
    - `if k > 0`: Ensures that there is still a remaining sum to distribute.
    - `nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)`: Sets the next element to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k`. This ensures that the next number is as large as possible without exceeding the remaining sum.
    - `k -= nums[i]`: Reduces the remaining sum by the value of `nums[i]`.
  - `nums[0] += k`: Adds any remaining value of `k` back to `nums[0]` to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.

- **State after the function call:**
  - `nums` is a list of length `n` where the first element `nums[0]` is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and the remaining elements are either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `k`. The value of `k` is 0.
  - The program returns a list `nums` of length `n`, where the first element `nums[0]` is adjusted to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. The logic and implementation are sound and meet the problem requirements.

Final: **True**
