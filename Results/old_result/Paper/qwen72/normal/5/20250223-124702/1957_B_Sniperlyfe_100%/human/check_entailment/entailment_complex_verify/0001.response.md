### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum is `k`.
   - Additionally, the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers should be maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for generating the sequence.
   - The sequence is initialized with `n` zeros.
   - The first element `nums[0]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`. This ensures that the first number has the maximum number of 1s possible.
   - The remaining sum `k` is then reduced by the value of `nums[0]`.
   - For each subsequent element in the sequence, if `k` is still greater than 0, the element is set to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`. This ensures that the next number is as large as possible without exceeding the remaining sum.
   - Finally, any remaining value of `k` is added to `nums[0]` to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - **Sum Condition:** The sum of the sequence is maintained by subtracting the values assigned to each element from `k` and adding any remaining value back to `nums[0]`. This ensures that the sum of the sequence is always `k`.
   - **Maximizing 1s in Binary Representation:** By setting the first element to the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`, and then distributing the remaining sum as large as possible, the solution ensures that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR is maximized.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `n = 1`, the function correctly returns `[k]` because the only element in the sequence must be `k`.
   - If `k` is very small compared to `n`, the function will distribute the sum as evenly as possible, ensuring that the number of 1s in the binary representation is maximized.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The solution is efficient and works within the given constraints. It constructs the sequence in linear time relative to `n`.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).

- **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
  - `nums` is initialized as a list of `n` zeros.
  - `nums[0]` is set to \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1\), which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`. This ensures that the first number has the maximum number of 1s possible.
  - `k` is reduced by the value of `nums[0]`.
  - For each subsequent element in the sequence, if `k` is still greater than 0, the element is set to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`. This ensures that the next number is as large as possible without exceeding the remaining sum.
  - Finally, any remaining value of `k` is added to `nums[0]` to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.

- **State after the loop:**
  - `nums` is a list of length `n` where the first element `nums[0]` is \((2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1)\) and the remaining elements are either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `k`. The value of `k` is 0.

- **State after the final adjustment:**
  - `nums[0]` is adjusted by adding any remaining value of `k` (which is 0 at this point), ensuring the sum of the sequence equals `k`.

### Final Evaluation:
The provided program correctly constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. The logic and implementation are sound and meet the problem requirements.

Final: **True**
