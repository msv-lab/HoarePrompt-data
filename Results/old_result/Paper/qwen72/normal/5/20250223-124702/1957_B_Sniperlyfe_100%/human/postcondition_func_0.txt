The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of length `n`. The first element `nums[0]` is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and is then adjusted by the remaining value of `k` (if any). The remaining elements of the list are set to 0 or 1, depending on the value of `k`, such that the sum of the elements in `nums` equals the initial value of `k`. After the function concludes, the value of `k` is 0.
