Output State: **`nums` is a list of length `n` where the first element `nums[0]` is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\), and the remaining elements are either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `k`. The value of `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nums[0] += k` increments the first element of the list `nums` by the value of `k`. Since `k` is 0, this operation does not change the value of `nums[0]`. Therefore, the first element of `nums` remains \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\), and the rest of the list and the value of `k` remain unchanged.
