### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` and calls the function `func_1` with these values.
   - The results of each test case are collected in a list `results` and printed at the end.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - **Initial Setup:**
     - A list `nums` of length `n` is initialized with all elements set to 0.
     - The first element `nums[0]` is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\), which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`.
     - The value of `k` is then reduced by `nums[0]`.

   - **Distributing Remaining `k`:**
     - The function iterates over the remaining elements of `nums` (from index 1 to `n-1`).
     - For each element, if `k` is greater than 0, it sets `nums[i]` to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`, and then reduces `k` by `nums[i]`.
     - This ensures that the remaining `k` is distributed among the elements of `nums` in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements.

   - **Final Adjustment:**
     - After the loop, if there is any remaining `k`, it is added to `nums[0]`.
     - This ensures that the sum of all elements in `nums` equals the original value of `k`.

3. **Output:**
   - The function returns the list `nums`, which is then printed as a space-separated string for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Sum Condition:**
  - The sum of the elements in `nums` is correctly maintained to be equal to `k` by the initial setup and the final adjustment.
  
- **Maximizing 1s in Binary Representation:**
  - The first element `nums[0]` is set to the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`. This maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
  - The remaining elements are set to the smallest possible values (0 or 1) to distribute the remaining `k` while maintaining the sum condition. This ensures that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR is maximized.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If `n` is 1, the function correctly sets `nums[0]` to `k`.
  - If `k` is 0, the function correctly sets all elements to 0, which satisfies the conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
