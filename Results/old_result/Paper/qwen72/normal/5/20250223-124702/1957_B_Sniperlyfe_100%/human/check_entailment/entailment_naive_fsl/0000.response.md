Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where \( k \) is less than \( n \). In such cases, it is impossible to construct a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers that sum up to \( k \) because at least one of the integers would have to be negative, which violates the problem constraints. For example, if \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 2 \), the program will still attempt to construct a sequence, but it is impossible to do so without violating the non-negativity constraint.
