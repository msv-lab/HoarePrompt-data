You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `nums` is a list of length `n` where the first element `nums[0]` is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and the remaining elements are either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `k`. The value of `k` is 0.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` of length `n`, where the first element `nums[0]` is 0, and the remaining elements are also 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum is `k`.
   - Additionally, the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers should be maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for generating the sequence.
   - The sequence is initialized with `n` zeros.
   - The first element `nums[0]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`. This ensures that the first number has the maximum number of 1s possible.
   - The remaining sum `k` is then reduced by the value of `nums[0]`.
   - For each subsequent element in the sequence, if `k` is still greater than 0, the element is set to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`. This ensures that the next number is as large as possible without exceeding the remaining sum.
   - Finally, any remaining value of `k` is added to `nums[0]` to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - **Sum Condition:** The sum of the sequence is maintained by subtracting the values assigned to each element from `k` and adding any remaining value back to `nums[0]`. This ensures that the sum of the sequence is always `k`.
   - **Maximizing 1s in Binary Representation:** By setting the first element to the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`, and then distributing the remaining sum as large as possible, the solution ensures that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR is maximized.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `n = 1`, the function correctly returns `[k]` because the only element in the sequence must be `k`.
   - If `k` is very small compared to `n`, the function will distribute the sum as evenly as possible, ensuring that the number of 1s in the binary representation is maximized.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The solution is efficient and works within the given constraints. It constructs the sequence in linear time relative to `n`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. The logic and implementation are sound and meet the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
