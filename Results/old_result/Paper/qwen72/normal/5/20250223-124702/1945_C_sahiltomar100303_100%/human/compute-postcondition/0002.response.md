Output State: **The loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed the optimal position `left` or `right` where the number of residents living on their preferred side of the road is maximized. The variables `n`, `s`, `mid`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `left`, `leftMove`, and `right` will be reset or updated for each new test case, but the overall number of test cases `t` will remain unchanged.**
