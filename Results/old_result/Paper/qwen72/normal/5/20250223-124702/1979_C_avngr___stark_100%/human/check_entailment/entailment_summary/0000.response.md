### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total amount of coins bet is `sum(x_i)` for all `i` from 1 to `n`.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To ensure that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, we need to find a set of bets `x_i` such that `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.
   - This can be achieved by setting `x_i` to a value that is proportional to the reciprocal of `k_i`. Specifically, if we set `x_i = m / k_i`, where `m` is a common multiple of all `k_i`, then the total bet `sum(x_i)` will be `m * (sum(1 / k_i))`.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b`. The LCM is used to find a common multiple of all `k_i` values.
   - **`func_2(numbers)`**: This function calculates the LCM of a list of integers `numbers`. It does this by iteratively applying `func_1` to the elements of the list.

4. **Program Logic:**
   - For each test case, the program calculates the LCM of the `k_i` values using `func_2`.
   - It then sets the bet `x_i` for each outcome to `m / k_i`, where `m` is the LCM.
   - The program checks if the total amount of coins bet `sum(x_i)` is strictly less than `m`. If it is, the solution is valid; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly calculates the LCM of the `k_i` values.
   - The bets `x_i` are set to `m / k_i`, which ensures that the amount received back for any winning outcome is `k_i * (m / k_i) = m`.
   - The total amount of coins bet is `sum(m / k_i)`, which is compared to `m` to check if the condition `sum(x_i) < m` is satisfied.
   - If the condition is satisfied, the program prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where no valid distribution of coins exists, such as when all `k_i` values are the same and equal to 1 (though the problem guarantees `k_i >= 2`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of coins for each test case, ensuring that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The use of the LCM ensures that the bets are integers and the condition is met.
