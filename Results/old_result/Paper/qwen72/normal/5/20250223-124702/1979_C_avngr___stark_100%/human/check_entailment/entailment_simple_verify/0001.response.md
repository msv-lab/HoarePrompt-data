### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires distributing coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, the amount of coins received back is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount of coins bet on outcome `i`.
   - The total amount of coins bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - The condition to satisfy is `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - The condition can be rewritten as `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.
   - This implies `sum(x_i) - x_i < (k_i - 1) * x_i` for all `i`.
   - Simplifying, we get `sum(x_j for j != i) < (k_i - 1) * x_i`.

3. **Finding a Solution:**
   - One way to ensure this condition is to set `x_i` such that the sum of all other bets is less than `(k_i - 1) * x_i`.
   - A straightforward approach is to set `x_i` to a value that is proportional to the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i - 1`.

4. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The LCM of a set of numbers can be calculated using the greatest common divisor (GCD) function.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` calculates the LCM of two numbers.
   - The function `func_2(numbers)` calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1`.

5. **Distributing the Coins:**
   - The program calculates the LCM of the multipliers `k_i` (not `k_i - 1`).
   - It then sets `x_i` to `m // k_i`, where `m` is the LCM of `k_i`.
   - The program checks if `sum(x_i) >= m` and prints `-1` if this condition is true.
   - If the condition is false, it prints the bets `x_i`.

6. **Checking the Program:**
   - The program correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers `k_i`.
   - It then sets the bets `x_i` to `m // k_i`.
   - The program checks if the total sum of bets `sum(x_i)` is less than `m` and prints `-1` if not.
   - If the total sum of bets is less than `m`, it prints the bets `x_i`.

7. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does handle the case where all `k_i` are the same. If all `k_i` are the same, the LCM will be `k_i`, and the bets `x_i` will be `1` for all `i`. The total sum of bets will be `n`, which is less than `k_i * n` (since `k_i >= 2`), so the condition is satisfied.
   - The program also correctly handles the output of the bets or the `-1` case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly addresses the problem requirements. It calculates the LCM of the multipliers `k_i`, sets the bets `x_i` accordingly, and checks if the total sum of bets is less than the LCM. If the condition is not satisfied, it prints `-1`. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
