You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    -3 -2 3 4 5

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        healths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        positions = list(map(int, input().split()))
        monsters = sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))
        total_bullets_used = 0
        success = True
        for i in range(n):
            (position, health) = monsters[i]
            distance = abs(position)
            time_available = distance
            bullets_needed = health
            if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
                success = False
                break
            total_bullets_used += bullets_needed
        print('YES' if success else 'NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by two lists `healths` and `positions` of length `n`. It then determines if it is possible to defeat all monsters by shooting them with bullets, where each monster's position and health are given. The function outputs 'YES' if the total number of bullets needed to defeat all monsters does not exceed the time available (which is the distance of the farthest monster), and 'NO' otherwise. The function processes all `t` test cases and prints the result for each.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the condition used to determine if you can survive and kill all the monsters. Specifically, the condition `if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:` is incorrect. It should be `if bullets_needed > time_available * k:`.

Here's why the current condition is incorrect:

- `total_bullets_used` is the cumulative number of bullets used so far.
- `bullets_needed` is the number of bullets needed to kill the current monster.
- `time_available` is the number of seconds the current monster will take to reach you.

The program checks if the total number of bullets used plus the bullets needed for the current monster exceeds the time available for the current monster. However, this does not correctly account for the fact that you can fire up to `k` bullets per second. The correct condition should check if the number of bullets needed for the current monster exceeds the number of bullets you can fire in the available time, which is `time_available * k`.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 2
1 2 3
-3 -2 -1
```

- The first monster is at position -3 with health 1.
- The second monster is at position -2 with health 2.
- The third monster is at position -1 with health 3.

The program will output `NO`, but the correct output should be `YES`.

Here's how you can survive:
- In the first second, you can fire 2 bullets at the third monster, reducing its health to 1. The third monster moves to position 0, but it is already dead.
- In the second second, you can fire 2 bullets at the second monster, reducing its health to 0. The second monster moves to position 0, but it is already dead.
- In the third second, you can fire 1 bullet at the first monster, reducing its health to 0. The first monster moves to position 0, but it is already dead.

Thus, the program does not handle this case correctly, and the correctness is **False**.
