Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the coordinates are given in a random order, and it assumes that the maximum and minimum x-coordinates will always correspond to the correct side length of the square. However, this is not always true. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
```

The program will calculate the side length as `dx = max(x) - min(x) = 2 - 1 = 1`, and thus the area as `1 * 1 = 1`. However, the correct area of the square is `1 * 1 = 1`, but the program should also consider the y-coordinates to determine the side length correctly. In this case, the side length should be `dy = max(y) - min(y) = 2 - 1 = 1`, and the area should be `1 * 1 = 1`. The program fails to handle this correctly.

To fix this, the program should calculate both `dx` and `dy` and ensure they are equal, then return the area as `dx * dx` or `dy * dy`. If `dx` and `dy` are not equal, the input points do not form a square, and the program should handle this case appropriately.
