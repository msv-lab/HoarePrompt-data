Reasoning:  
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided example. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. This matches the input format described in the problem.

2. **Coordinate Extraction**: The program extracts the x-coordinates from the list of coordinates and stores them in the list `x`.

3. **Area Calculation**: The program calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`). Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference in x-coordinates will be the same as the difference in y-coordinates, and thus `dx` represents the side length of the square. The area of the square is then calculated as `dx * dx`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the area of the square for each test case, which is the correct output format.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the constraints and edge cases as described. It works for any valid input within the range `-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000` and `1 <= t <= 100`.

Given the problem constraints and the example provided, the program correctly computes the area of the square for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
