### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads four lines, each containing two integers, and stores these coordinates in a list `a`.

2. **Coordinate Extraction:**
   - The function extracts the x-coordinates from the list of coordinates and stores them in a list `x`.

3. **Area Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx`).
   - Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates) will be the side length of the square.
   - The area of the square is then calculated as `dx * dx` and printed.

4. **Assumptions:**
   - The problem guarantees that the input coordinates form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
   - Therefore, the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates) will always be the same and non-zero.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the range of inputs correctly, as it is guaranteed that the coordinates are within the range \([-1000, 1000]\) and that there is a valid square for each test case.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the area of the square for each test case, which is the correct output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reads the input, processes the coordinates to find the side length of the square, and calculates and prints the area of the square for each test case. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem description and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
