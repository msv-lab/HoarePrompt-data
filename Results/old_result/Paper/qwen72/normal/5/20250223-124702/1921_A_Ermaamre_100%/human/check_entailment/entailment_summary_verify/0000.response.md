### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a potential issue with the program. However, upon closer inspection, the program is actually correct for the given problem constraints. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Problem Constraints**:
   - The problem guarantees that the input points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
   - The area of the square is strictly greater than 0.

2. **Program Behavior**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates.
   - It extracts the x-coordinates from these pairs and calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx`).
   - It prints the area of the square as `dx * dx`.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func` correctly processes the input and calculates the area based on the x-coordinates.
   - The function does not return any value, which is consistent with the problem's requirement to print the area directly.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment suggests that the program might fail if the coordinates are given in a random order.
   - However, for a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates will always be equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates. This is because the sides of the square are parallel to the axes, and the side length is the same in both dimensions.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the example input:
     ```
     1
     1 1
     1 2
     2 1
     2 2
     ```
     - The x-coordinates are `[1, 1, 2, 2]`.
     - The y-coordinates are `[1, 2, 1, 2]`.
     - `dx = max(x) - min(x) = 2 - 1 = 1`.
     - `dy = max(y) - min(y) = 2 - 1 = 1`.
     - The area is `dx * dx = 1 * 1 = 1`, which is correct.

   - Another example from the problem statement:
     ```
     3
     1 2
     4 5
     1 5
     4 2
     -1 1
     1 -1
     1 1
     -1 -1
     45 11
     45 39
     17 11
     17 39
     ```
     - For the first test case:
       - x-coordinates: `[1, 4, 1, 4]`.
       - y-coordinates: `[2, 5, 5, 2]`.
       - `dx = max(x) - min(x) = 4 - 1 = 3`.
       - `dy = max(y) - min(y) = 5 - 2 = 3`.
       - The area is `dx * dx = 3 * 3 = 9`, which is correct.
     - For the second test case:
       - x-coordinates: `[-1, 1, 1, -1]`.
       - y-coordinates: `[1, -1, 1, -1]`.
       - `dx = max(x) - min(x) = 1 - (-1) = 2`.
       - `dy = max(y) - min(y) = 1 - (-1) = 2`.
       - The area is `dx * dx = 2 * 2 = 4`, which is correct.
     - For the third test case:
       - x-coordinates: `[45, 45, 17, 17]`.
       - y-coordinates: `[11, 39, 11, 39]`.
       - `dx = max(x) - min(x) = 45 - 17 = 28`.
       - `dy = max(y) - min(y) = 39 - 11 = 28`.
       - The area is `dx * dx = 28 * 28 = 784`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the area of the square by only considering the x-coordinates because the problem guarantees that the input points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Therefore, the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates will always be equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
