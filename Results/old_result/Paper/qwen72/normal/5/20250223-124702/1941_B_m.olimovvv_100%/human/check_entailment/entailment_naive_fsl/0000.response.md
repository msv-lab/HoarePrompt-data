Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the program attempts to reduce the elements of the array by performing the operation from the beginning of the array towards the end. However, this approach does not correctly handle all edge cases and can lead to incorrect results.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```
The expected output is "YES" because the operations can be applied as described in the problem statement to make all elements zero:
1. Apply the operation at \(i=4\): \([1, 3, 4, 3, 1]\)
2. Apply the operation at \(i=3\): \([1, 2, 2, 2, 1]\)
3. Apply the operation at \(i=2\): \([0, 0, 1, 2, 1]\)
4. Apply the operation at \(i=4\): \([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\)

However, the program will output "NO" because it does not correctly handle the reduction of elements in a way that ensures all elements can be made zero.

### Issue:
The program does not correctly account for the fact that the operation can be applied in a way that balances the reduction of elements across the array. The current approach only reduces elements from the beginning to the end, which can lead to incorrect results if the elements are not balanced in a way that allows all elements to be reduced to zero.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve checking if the sum of the elements in the array is divisible by 4 and if the elements can be reduced in a way that ensures all elements become zero. This involves a more sophisticated algorithm that balances the reduction of elements across the array.
