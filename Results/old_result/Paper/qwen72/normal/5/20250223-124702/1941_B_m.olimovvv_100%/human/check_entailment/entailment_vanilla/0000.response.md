### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` integers.
   - We can perform an operation that decreases `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, for any index `i` in the range `[2, n-1]`.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using these operations.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided program iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `a` of the array and the array `b` itself.
   - It then iterates through the array from the first element to the second-to-last element, performing the following steps:
     - If the current element `b[i]` is negative, it immediately prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.
     - It updates `b[i+1]` by subtracting `b[i] * 2`.
     - It updates `b[i+2]` by subtracting `b[i]`.
     - It sets `b[i]` to zero.
   - After the loop, it checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Negative Element Check**: The program correctly checks if any element becomes negative during the operations. If it does, it immediately prints "NO" because a negative element means the operation cannot be performed to make all elements zero.
   - **Operation Simulation**: The program simulates the operation by updating `b[i+1]` and `b[i+2]` based on the current element `b[i]`. This is a valid approach because it ensures that the operation is applied correctly.
   - **Final Check**: The program checks if the last two elements of the array are zero after the operations. This is a necessary condition because if the last two elements are not zero, it is impossible to make all elements zero using the given operation.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the array length is 3 or more.
   - It correctly processes multiple test cases.
   - It ensures that the operations do not result in negative elements, which is a key requirement.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Array Length Check**: The program does not explicitly check if the array length `a` is at least 3. However, the problem description guarantees that `3 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5`, so this is not an issue.
   - **Initial Element Check**: The program does not check if the initial elements of the array are non-negative, but the problem description guarantees that `0 \le a_j \le 10^9`, so this is also not an issue.
   - **Final Element Check**: The program correctly checks the last two elements, but it does not explicitly check if the entire array is zero. However, the way the operations are applied ensures that if the last two elements are zero, all other elements must also be zero.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the problem requirements. It correctly simulates the operations and checks the final state of the array.

**Correctness: True**
