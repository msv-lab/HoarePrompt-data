The function reads from standard input a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only the characters "U" and "D". For each test case, it counts the occurrences of "U" in the string `s`. If the count is odd, it prints 'YES'; if the count is even, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the completion of all iterations, with the `index` variable equal to `2 * t + 1`, and the `t` and `data` variables remaining unchanged.
