### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach for handling multiple test cases.
   - The first element of the list `data` is the number of test cases `t`.
   - The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads the next two elements from `data` to get `n` and `s`.

2. **Game Logic:**
   - The game's outcome is determined by the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`).
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win. This is because Alice goes first, and if the number of facing-up coins is odd, she can always make a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob. Bob will then be forced to leave an odd number of facing-up coins for Alice, and this pattern will continue until Bob is left with no facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will win. This is because Bob can always respond to Alice's moves in such a way that the number of facing-up coins remains even, and eventually, Alice will be left with no facing-up coins.

3. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints "YES" if the number of facing-up coins is odd and "NO" if it is even.
   - The output is case-insensitive, which matches the problem's requirements.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 or 2 correctly. If `n` is 1, the game ends immediately, and if `n` is 2, the game ends with one coin left, which is handled by the logic of counting 'U' coins.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins. It reads the input correctly, processes each test case, and outputs the correct result for each case.

### Correctness:
**True**
