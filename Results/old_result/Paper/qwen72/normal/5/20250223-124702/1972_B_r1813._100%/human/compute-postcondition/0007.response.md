The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and it must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Each tuple in the list contains an integer `n` and a string `s`. The integer `n` must be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the string `s` must have a length equal to `n` and consist only of the characters "U" and "D".

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases. The result for each test case is determined based on the string `s` and the integer `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` with characters "U" and "D" only. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to one of the test cases.**
