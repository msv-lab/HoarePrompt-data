The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is an integer equal to the first element of `data` converted to an integer, and `index` is 1. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`data` is a list of strings, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is 1**
