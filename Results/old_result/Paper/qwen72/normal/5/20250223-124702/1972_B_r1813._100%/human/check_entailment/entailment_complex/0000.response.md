### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is a valid approach for handling input in a competitive programming context. It splits the input into a list of strings, where the first element is the number of test cases `t`.
   - The program then iterates over the test cases, reading the integer `n` and the string `s` for each case.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The program counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string `s` using `s.count('U')`.
   - It then checks if the count of 'U' coins is odd or even:
     - If the count is odd, it prints 'YES' (Alice wins).
     - If the count is even, it prints 'NO' (Bob wins).

3. **Game Analysis**:
   - The game is played optimally, and the key to determining the winner lies in the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always make the first move and leave an even number of facing-up coins for Bob. This ensures that Alice can always make a move when it's her turn, and Bob will eventually be left with no facing-up coins to choose.
   - Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice will eventually be left with no facing-up coins to choose.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints 'YES' for an odd number of 'U' coins and 'NO' for an even number of 'U' coins, which aligns with the game's rules and the optimal play strategy.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 or 2 correctly:
     - If `n` is 1 and the coin is 'U', Alice wins (odd count).
     - If `n` is 2 and both coins are 'U', Bob wins (even count).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins. It handles all the described cases and edge conditions appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
