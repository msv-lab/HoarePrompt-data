The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function will process a set of test cases, each containing a number of constraints. Each test case is defined by an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500), and each test case contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is a pair of integers `(a, x)` where `a` is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, and no two constraints are the same.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the constraints provided. However, the specific return values or conditions for these returns are not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function processes a set of test cases, each containing a number of unique constraints represented by pairs of integers (a, x). It returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.**
