Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, and no two constraints are the same.**
