Reasoning:  
The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`). If either condition is met, it prints the corresponding result; otherwise, it prints "NONE". The program follows the problem description and the provided example, and the execution summary confirms that it behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
