Reasoning:  
The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times. In each iteration, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, and checks the following conditions:
- If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
- If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
- Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

The conditions correctly match the problem description:
- A stair is defined as `a < b < c`.
- A peak is defined as `a < b > c`.

The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. It processes each test case independently, and the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are only relevant to the last test case, which is not an issue since the output is printed immediately after each test case is processed.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
