The function `func` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple of three digits (a, b, c) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The number of test cases t is a positive integer where 1 <= t <= 1000. The function returns a list of results based on the input test cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple of three digits (a, b, c) with each digit ranging from 0 to 9, and the number of test cases ranging from 1 to 1000. It returns a list of results for each test case.**
