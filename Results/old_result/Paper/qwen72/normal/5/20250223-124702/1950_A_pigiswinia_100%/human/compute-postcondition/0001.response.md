The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0, and `t` should be an integer within the specified range (1 <= t <= 1000).

State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000**
