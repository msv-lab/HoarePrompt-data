Output State: `input` is still a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read, `t` is equal to the integer value of the first element in `data`, `index` is equal to `1 + t * (1 + n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in each array processed in the loop, and `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration of the loop.
