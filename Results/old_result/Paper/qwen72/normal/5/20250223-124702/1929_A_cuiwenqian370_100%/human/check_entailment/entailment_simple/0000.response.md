### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Rearranging the elements of the array can change the beauty, and we need to find the maximum possible beauty.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` sorts the array and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - However, the problem requires the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) without the absolute value. This means we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences.

3. **Optimal Solution**:
   - To maximize the beauty, the optimal strategy is to sort the array in descending order. This way, the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) will be maximally positive for the largest elements and minimally negative for the smallest elements.
   - The current implementation in `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order, which is incorrect for maximizing the beauty as defined in the problem.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly extracts the length of the array and the array elements for each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` with the array and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The input handling and test case processing in `func_2` are correct.
   - The logic in `func_1` is incorrect because it sorts the array in ascending order instead of descending order.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because the sorting in `func_1` should be in descending order to maximize the beauty of the array as defined in the problem.
