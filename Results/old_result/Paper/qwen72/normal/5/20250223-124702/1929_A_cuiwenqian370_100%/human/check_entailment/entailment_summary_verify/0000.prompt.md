You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract multiple arrays, applies another function `func_1` to each array, and prints the results of these applications. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input state remains unchanged, and the results of `func_1` for each array are printed to the console.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after sorting the array, but this does not maximize the beauty of the array as defined.

The problem defines the beauty of the array as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this sum, the array should be sorted in descending order, not ascending order, because the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) will be negative, and the sum of these negative differences will be maximized when the array is in descending order.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2 1 3
```
The correct output should be 2, as explained in the problem statement. However, the current implementation of `func_1` will sort the array to `[1, 2, 3]` and calculate the beauty as:
\[
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2
\]
This is correct, but it is not the general approach that maximizes the beauty for all cases.

Consider another input:
```
4
3 4 3 3
```
The correct output should be 1, which can be achieved by sorting the array in descending order to `[4, 3, 3, 3]` and calculating the beauty as:
\[
(3 - 4) + (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) = -1 + 0 + 0 = -1
\]
However, the current implementation will sort the array in ascending order to `[3, 3, 3, 4]` and calculate the beauty as:
\[
(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
\]
This is incorrect because the beauty should be maximized, and the correct approach would be to sort the array in descending order.

To fix this, the `func_1` function should sort the array in descending order:
```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort(reverse=True)
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty
```

This change will ensure that the program correctly maximizes the beauty of the array for all potential cases.
