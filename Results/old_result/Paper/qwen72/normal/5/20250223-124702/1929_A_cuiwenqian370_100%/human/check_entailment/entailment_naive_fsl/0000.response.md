Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after sorting the array, but this does not maximize the beauty of the array as defined.

The problem defines the beauty of the array as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this sum, the array should be sorted in descending order, not ascending order, because the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) will be negative, and the sum of these negative differences will be maximized when the array is in descending order.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2 1 3
```
The correct output should be 2, as explained in the problem statement. However, the current implementation of `func_1` will sort the array to `[1, 2, 3]` and calculate the beauty as:
\[
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2
\]
This is correct, but it is not the general approach that maximizes the beauty for all cases.

Consider another input:
```
4
3 4 3 3
```
The correct output should be 1, which can be achieved by sorting the array in descending order to `[4, 3, 3, 3]` and calculating the beauty as:
\[
(3 - 4) + (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) = -1 + 0 + 0 = -1
\]
However, the current implementation will sort the array in ascending order to `[3, 3, 3, 4]` and calculate the beauty as:
\[
(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
\]
This is incorrect because the beauty should be maximized, and the correct approach would be to sort the array in descending order.

To fix this, the `func_1` function should sort the array in descending order:
```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort(reverse=True)
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty
```

This change will ensure that the program correctly maximizes the beauty of the array for all potential cases.
