Reasoning:

The original assessment is partially correct but contains a misunderstanding of the problem statement. The problem defines the beauty of the array as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this sum, the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) should be maximized, which can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order, not descending order.

Here's why:

1. **Ascending Order Calculation**:
   - When the array is sorted in ascending order, the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are non-negative and as large as possible for the given elements.
   - For example, with the array `[1, 2, 3]`, the beauty is calculated as:
     \[
     (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2
     \]
   - This is the maximum possible beauty for this array.

2. **Descending Order Calculation**:
   - When the array is sorted in descending order, the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are non-positive and as small as possible (or negative).
   - For example, with the array `[3, 2, 1]`, the beauty is calculated as:
     \[
     (2 - 3) + (1 - 2) = -1 + -1 = -2
     \]
   - This is not the maximum possible beauty for this array.

3. **General Case**:
   - For any array, sorting in ascending order ensures that the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are maximized, leading to the maximum beauty.
   - Sorting in descending order would minimize these differences, leading to a lower or negative beauty.

Given this reasoning, the current implementation of `func_1` is actually correct. The function sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the sum of the differences, which is the correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
