Precondition: **No variables in the function signature.** 

However, based on the context and the function's role in processing input and output for multiple test cases, it implicitly interacts with the following:
- **t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.**
- **n is an integer representing the length of the array a, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.**
- **array is a list of integers, where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and the length of the list is n.**

The function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes it to extract the number of test cases and the arrays for each test case, then calls `func_1` to compute the result for each array.
