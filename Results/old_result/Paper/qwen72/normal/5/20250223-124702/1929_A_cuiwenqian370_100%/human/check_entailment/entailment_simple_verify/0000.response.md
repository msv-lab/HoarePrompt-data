Reasoning: The original assessment is partially correct but misses a crucial point. The problem defines the beauty of the array as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The key to maximizing this sum is to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. However, the original assessment incorrectly suggests that sorting the array in descending order will always maximize the beauty.

In fact, the beauty is maximized by sorting the array in ascending order, not descending order. Here's why:

1. **Ascending Order**: When the array is sorted in ascending order, the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are always non-negative. This ensures that the sum of these differences is maximized because each difference is positive or zero.

2. **Descending Order**: When the array is sorted in descending order, the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are always non-positive. This ensures that the sum of these differences is minimized because each difference is negative or zero.

Given the problem statement, the correct approach is to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\). The current implementation of `func_1` already does this correctly. Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect in suggesting that the array should be sorted in descending order.

Let's validate this with the provided examples:

- For the input:
  ```
  3
  2 1 3
  ```
  The array is sorted to `[1, 2, 3]` and the beauty is calculated as:
  \[
  (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2
  \]
  This is correct.

- For the input:
  ```
  4
  3 4 3 3
  ```
  The array is sorted to `[3, 3, 3, 4]` and the beauty is calculated as:
  \[
  (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
  \]
  This is also correct.

Thus, the current implementation of `func_1` is correct and maximizes the beauty of the array as defined in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
