Reasoning:

The original assessment is partially correct but contains a misunderstanding of the problem's definition of "beauty." The problem defines the beauty of the array as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). This means that the differences are not taken as absolute values, but rather as simple differences. Therefore, the goal is to maximize the sum of these differences, not the sum of their absolute values.

Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The beauty of the array is defined as \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).
   - To maximize this sum, we need to maximize each term \((a_i - a_{i-1})\).

2. **Behavior of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order.
   - It then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements: \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).
   - For an array sorted in ascending order, each term \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) is non-negative, and the sum is maximized.

3. **Behavior of `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract multiple arrays, and applies `func_1` to each array.
   - It correctly handles the input format and prints the results of `func_1` for each array.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     3
     2 1 3
     ```
     - Sorting in ascending order: `[1, 2, 3]`
     - Beauty: \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2\)
     - This is correct and matches the expected output.

   - For the input:
     ```
     4
     3 4 3 3
     ```
     - Sorting in ascending order: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
     - Beauty: \((3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\)
     - This is correct and matches the expected output.

5. **General Case**:
   - Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that each term \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) is non-negative, which maximizes the sum of these differences.
   - Sorting in descending order would minimize the sum of these differences, as each term \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) would be non-positive.

Therefore, the current implementation of `func_1` is actually correct for the problem as defined. The original assessment's suggestion to sort the array in descending order is incorrect because it would minimize the beauty, not maximize it.

Final: **True**
