#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters.
def func_1():
    return int(putin())
    #The program returns an integer value input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value input by the user.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used. The function reads input from a source (putin()) and returns a map object of integers.
def func_2():
    return map(int, putin().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains integers obtained by splitting the input string from `putin()` and converting each split part into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a string input from the `putin()` function, splits the string into parts based on whitespace, converts each part into an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not modify any external variables and does not have any side effects. After the function call, the user will have a map object that can be iterated over to access the integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_ar and sec_arr are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The integers in the tuples represent item prices for Alice and Bob, respectively.

            sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
        
    #State: `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged. `sub_summ` is the initial sum of the first integers in each tuple of `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the elements is greater than or equal to 0.
    return sub_summ
    #The program returns the value of `sub_summ`, which is the initial sum of the first integers in each tuple of `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the elements is greater than or equal to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two lists of tuples, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, where each tuple contains two integers representing item prices for Alice and Bob. It calculates the sum of the first integers in each tuple of `sec_arr` and adds to this sum the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of these elements is greater than or equal to 0. The function returns this final sum. The input lists `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged.
