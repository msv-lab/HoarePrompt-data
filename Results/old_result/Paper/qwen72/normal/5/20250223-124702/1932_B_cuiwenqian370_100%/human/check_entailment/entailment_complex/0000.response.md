Reasoning:

The function `func_1` is designed to solve the problem of finding the year when the n-th sign will occur, which is the year of the apocalypse according to the Chaya tribe's beliefs. The function reads from standard input, processes the input for multiple test cases, and writes the results to standard output.

1. **Input Reading and Parsing**:
   - The function reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `T` and the details of each test case (number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the function initializes `last_year` to the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates through the list of periodicities starting from the second sign.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur, ensuring that it occurs strictly after the previous sign. This is done using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, which finds the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.
   - The `last_year` is updated to this new value for the next iteration.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the final `last_year` is appended to the `results` list as a string.
   - After processing all test cases, the results are written to standard output, each on a new line.

The logic used to calculate the next year for each sign is correct. The formula ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one, and it correctly finds the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than the last year.

The function also correctly handles multiple test cases and formats the output as required.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
