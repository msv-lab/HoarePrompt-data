Output State: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the periodicities of the signs, and an integer `n` representing the number of signs. The list `a` should have a length equal to `n`, and each element `a_i` in the list should satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. The integer `n` should satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The variable `input` is now a reference to the `sys.stdin.read` function. `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` by whitespace. `index` is 1. `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`. `results` is an empty list.**
