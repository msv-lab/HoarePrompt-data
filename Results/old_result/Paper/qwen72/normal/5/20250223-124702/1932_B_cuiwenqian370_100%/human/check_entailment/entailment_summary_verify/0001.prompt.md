You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        last_year = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
            last_year = next_year
        results.append(str(last_year))
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads input from standard input, processes multiple sets of signs based on the input, and writes the results to standard output. Each set of signs is defined by a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. The function calculates the last year for each set of signs and appends it to a list of results. After processing all sets, the function writes the results to standard output, with each result on a new line. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the `results` list containing the calculated last years as strings, and the variables `index`, `T`, and `data` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then initializes an index to keep track of the current position in the list.
   - The first integer `T` is read, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` (the number of signs) and the list `a` (the periodicities of the signs).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes `last_year` to the first periodicity `a[0]`, which is the year when the first sign occurs.
   - It then iterates through the list `a` starting from the second sign.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
     \]
     This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year + 1`.
   - The `last_year` is updated to `next_year` for the next iteration.
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the final `last_year` is appended to the `results` list.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program writes the results to the standard output, each on a new line.

4. **Correctness of the Formula:**
   - The formula \(\left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]\) is correct because:
     - \(\text{last\_year} + 1\) ensures that the next year is strictly after the last year.
     - \(\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1\) ensures that the next year is a multiple of `a[i]`.
     - Dividing by `a[i]` and then multiplying by `a[i]` ensures that the result is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` greater than or equal to \(\text{last\_year} + 1\).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when all periodicities are 1 (e.g., the third test case in the example).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The input parsing and the calculation of the next year for each sign are both accurate and efficient.
