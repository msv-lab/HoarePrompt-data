Output State: **The loop executes t times, and for each iteration, it reads n, a, and b from input, calculates k as the minimum of n and (b - a), and prints the result of the calculation based on the conditions provided. The values of t, n, a, and b are not retained between iterations, and the loop does not modify any variables outside of its scope.**
