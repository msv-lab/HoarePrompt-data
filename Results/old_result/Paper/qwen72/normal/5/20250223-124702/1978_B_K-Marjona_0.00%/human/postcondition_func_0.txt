The function `func` reads an integer `t` from input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from input. It then calculates a value based on these inputs and prints the result. The calculation is as follows: if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a * n`. Otherwise, it prints a more complex expression involving `n`, `a`, and `b`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not retained, and the function does not modify any external variables.
