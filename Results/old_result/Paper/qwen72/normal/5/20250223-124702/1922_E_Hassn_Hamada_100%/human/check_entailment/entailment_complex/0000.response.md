Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of generating an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The approach taken by the program involves a recursive function `func_1` that modifies the `sequence` list to meet the requirement. However, there are several issues with the program that affect its correctness:

1. **Incorrect Return Value in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` always returns `(0, 0)`, but this return value is never used. The return value should be ignored or the function should be modified to not return anything if the return value is not utilized.

2. **Incorrect Initialization of `size_overlap`**:
   - The variable `size_overlap` is initialized as a tuple `(0, 0)`, but it should be initialized as a tuple of integers. The correct initialization should be `size_overlap = (0, 0)`.

3. **Incorrect Loop and Condition**:
   - The loop `for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1)` is incorrect. The `max(sequence, default=0)` should be `max(sequence, default=-1)` to ensure that the loop starts from the maximum value in the sequence or -1 if the sequence is empty. This is because the sequence can contain negative values, and starting from 0 could lead to incorrect behavior.
   - The condition `while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` is incorrect. The correct condition should be `while (1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) <= number` to ensure proper bitwise operations.

4. **Incorrect Calculation of `value`**:
   - The calculation of `value` in the loop is incorrect. It should be `value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)` instead of `value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)`. This is a redundant assignment and should be removed.

5. **Incorrect Recursive Call**:
   - The recursive call `func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `func_1(number - ((1 << size) - (1 << overlap)), sequence)` to ensure the correct subtraction of the number of subsequences generated in the current call.

6. **Base Case Handling**:
   - The base case handling in `func_1` is incorrect. The function should return immediately when `number == 0` without modifying the sequence. The current implementation returns `(0, 0)` but does not terminate the function, which could lead to incorrect behavior.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly generate the required array for the given problem description.

Correctness: **False**
