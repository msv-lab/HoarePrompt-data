To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head: `i`, `sequence`, and the parameters of `range`.

1. **`i`**: This variable is initialized by the `range` function and will take the values from `max(sequence, default=0)` down to 0 (inclusive) in steps of -1.
2. **`sequence`**: This is the list of integers that the `max` function will use to determine the starting value of `i`. If `sequence` is empty, the `max` function will return 0 due to the `default=0` parameter.
3. **`range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1)`**: The loop will execute if `max(sequence, default=0)` is greater than or equal to 0. Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, it will stop when `i` is -1, meaning it will execute for all values from `max(sequence, default=0)` down to 0.

Given the initial state:
- `number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18.
- `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200, with elements in the range [-10^9, 10^9].
- `size_overlap` is (0, 0).

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `sequence` is not empty and contains at least one element greater than or equal to 0. If `sequence` is empty, the loop will start from 0 and execute once.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `sequence` must have at least one element greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` is initialized to `max(sequence, default=0)`.

State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200, with elements in the range [-10^9, 10^9] and must have at least one element greater than or equal to 0, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `i` is initialized to `max(sequence, default=0)`**.
