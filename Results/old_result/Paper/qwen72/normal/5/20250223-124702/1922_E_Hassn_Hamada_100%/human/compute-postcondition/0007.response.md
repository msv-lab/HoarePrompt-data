Output State: **`size_overlap` is a tuple `(size, i)`, where `size` is the largest integer such that `(1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number` and `i` is the corresponding index from the loop. `size` is now the first element of `size_overlap`, and `overlap` is now the second element of `size_overlap`. The values of `number`, `sequence`, and the elements of `sequence` remain unchanged.**
