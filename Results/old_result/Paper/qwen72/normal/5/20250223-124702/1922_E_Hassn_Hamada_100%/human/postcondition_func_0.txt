The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. It modifies the `sequence` list by appending a series of integers based on the input `number`. The function always returns the tuple `(0, 0)`. After the function concludes, the `sequence` list is extended, and the `number` and `sequence` variables are not otherwise modified.
