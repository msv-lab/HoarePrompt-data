Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Input Reading Functions**:
   - `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are all functions designed to read input from the user. However, they are not used in any meaningful way to solve the problem.
   - These functions are not integrated into a main function or any other logic that would use the input to perform the required operations.

2. **Missing Binary Search and Swap Logic**:
   - The problem description requires implementing a binary search algorithm on a permutation after performing up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search finds the correct element.
   - The provided program does not contain any logic for binary search or for performing swaps on the permutation.

3. **Output Requirements**:
   - The program should output the number of swaps performed and the indices of the elements to be swapped.
   - The provided program does not generate any output that matches the required format.

Given these points, the program is indeed incorrect as it does not perform the necessary operations to solve the problem as specified.

Final: **False**
