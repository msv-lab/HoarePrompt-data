### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x` using `func_2()`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` using `func_3()`.

2. **Binary Search and Swapping:**
   - The program initializes a dictionary `num_indx` to store the index of each element in the permutation `p`.
   - It initializes a list `seen` to keep track of which elements have been "seen" during the binary search process.
   - The binary search is performed on the permutation `p` with initial values `left = 0` and `right = n`.
   - During the binary search, the program updates the `seen` list to mark the elements that have been encountered.
   - If the element at `p[left]` is equal to `x`, the program prints `0` (no swaps needed).
   - If `x` is not in the `seen` list, the program prints `1` and the indices to swap `x` into the correct position.
   - If `x` is in the `seen` list but not at `p[left]`, the program prints `2` and the indices to swap `x` into the correct position.

3. **Algorithm Correctness:**
   - The binary search is correctly implemented, but it is applied to an unsorted permutation, which is not the standard use case for binary search.
   - The program attempts to correct the permutation by performing at most 2 swaps before the binary search.
   - The logic for determining the swaps is based on the `seen` list and the position of `x` in the permutation.
   - The program ensures that after the swaps, the binary search will correctly find `x` at `p[left]`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position by printing `0`.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is not in the `seen` list by performing a single swap to place `x` at the correct position.
   - For the case where `x` is in the `seen` list but not at `p[left]`, the program performs two swaps to place `x` at the correct position.

5. **Overall Logic:**
   - The program's logic is designed to ensure that the binary search will find `x` after at most 2 swaps.
   - The use of the `seen` list and the dictionary `num_indx` helps in efficiently determining the necessary swaps.

### Conclusion:
The program is designed to solve the problem correctly by ensuring that the binary search will find `x` after at most 2 swaps. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem description and handle all the specified cases.

Correctness: **True**
