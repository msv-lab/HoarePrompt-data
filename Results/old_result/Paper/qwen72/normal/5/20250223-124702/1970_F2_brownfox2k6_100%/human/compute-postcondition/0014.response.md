Postcondition: ***`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates (row, column) of an entity on the field, and `d` is a string representing the direction of movement. If `d` is 'U', the row coordinate of `obj` is now `obj[0] - 1` and the column coordinate remains unchanged. If `d` is 'D', the row coordinate of `obj` is incremented by 1. If `d` is 'L', the column coordinate of `obj` is decreased by 1. If `d` is 'R', the column coordinate of `obj` is increased by 1. If `d` is not 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `obj` remains unchanged.***
