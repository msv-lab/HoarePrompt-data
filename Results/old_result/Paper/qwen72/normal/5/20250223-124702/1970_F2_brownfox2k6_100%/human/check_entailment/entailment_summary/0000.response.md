Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly initializes the field by reading the dimensions `n` and `m`.
   - It then reads the field and populates the lists `rg` and `bg` with the coordinates of the red and blue goals, respectively.
   - The coordinates of the Quaffle and the Bludger are also correctly identified and stored.
   - The dictionary `player` is used to store the coordinates of each player, which is a good approach for quick lookups.

2. **Game Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of steps `T` and then processes each step.
   - For each step, it correctly handles the actions based on the entity and the action type:
     - **Catching the Quaffle**: The player who catches the Quaffle is stored in the variable `carry`.
     - **Throwing the Quaffle**: The program checks if the Quaffle is in a goal and updates the score accordingly. It also resets the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field.
     - **Moving the Quaffle or Bludger**: The function `func_1` is called to update the coordinates of the Quaffle or Bludger.
     - **Moving a Player**: The function `func_1` is called to update the player's coordinates. If the player is carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle's coordinates are updated to match the player's new position.

3. **Elimination Logic**:
   - The function `func_2` is called after a player moves to check if any player has been eliminated by the Bludger.
   - It correctly identifies and eliminates players who are in the same position as the Bludger.
   - The eliminated players are printed in the correct format and order.

4. **Final Score**:
   - After processing all the steps, the program prints the final score in the correct format.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where a player scores in their own goal by awarding the point to the opposing team.
   - It also correctly handles the case where multiple players are eliminated at the same time step by sorting the player identifiers before printing the elimination messages.

6. **Constraints**:
   - The program adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description, such as the valid range for `N`, `M`, and `T`, and the valid actions for each entity.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. It handles all the required actions, updates the field and scores appropriately, and prints the necessary events and the final score.

Correctness: **True**
