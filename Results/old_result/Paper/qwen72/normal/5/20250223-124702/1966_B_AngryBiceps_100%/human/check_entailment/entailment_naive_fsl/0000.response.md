Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the possibility of a grid where the first and last rows or columns are not uniform but still allow for the entire grid to be turned into a single color through valid operations.

**Counterexample:**

Consider the following grid:
```
3 3
BWB
WBW
BWB
```

For this grid, the program will output "NO" because the first and last rows are not uniform (i.e., `a[0]` and `a[-1]` are not all the same character), and the first and last columns are also not uniform (i.e., `first_row` and `last_row` are not all the same character).

However, it is possible to turn the entire grid into a single color using valid operations. For example, you can select the top-left and bottom-right corners (both 'B') and color the entire grid 'B'. Thus, the correct output should be "YES".

This counterexample demonstrates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to an incorrect output for some valid inputs.
