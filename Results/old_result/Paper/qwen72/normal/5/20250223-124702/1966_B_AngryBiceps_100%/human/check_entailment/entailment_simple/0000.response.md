### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid itself, storing each row as a string in the list `a`.

2. **Conditions for "NO"**:
   - The function checks two conditions to determine if it is impossible to make all squares in the grid the same color:
     - **First Condition**: If the first row and the last row are both monochromatic (i.e., all characters in the row are the same) but have different colors.
     - **Second Condition**: If the first column and the last column are both monochromatic but have different colors.
   - If either of these conditions is true, the function prints "NO" and moves to the next test case.

3. **Conditions for "YES"**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, the function prints "YES".
   - The logic behind this is that if the first and last rows are not both monochromatic with different colors, and the first and last columns are not both monochromatic with different colors, it is always possible to make the entire grid monochromatic by selecting appropriate subrectangles.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` or `m` is 1 correctly. For example, if `n = 1` and `m = 1`, the grid is already monochromatic, so it prints "YES".
   - It also handles the case where the grid is already monochromatic by default, which is covered by the "YES" condition.

5. **Resetting Variables**:
   - The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are reset for each new test case, ensuring that the function processes each test case independently.

### Correctness:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the conditions it checks. It correctly identifies when it is impossible to make the entire grid monochromatic and when it is possible.

Correctness: **True**
