Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all squares in an n \times m grid the same color using the specified operations. The operations allow selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

The given function `func` processes each test case by reading the grid dimensions and the grid itself. It then checks the first and last rows, as well as the first and last columns, to determine if it's possible to make the entire grid the same color.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **First and Last Rows Check:**
   - The function checks if the first row and the last row are entirely one color and different from each other.
   - If both the first and last rows are entirely one color and different, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color if the first and last rows are different and uniform.

2. **First and Last Columns Check:**
   - The function checks if the first column and the last column are entirely one color and different from each other.
   - If both the first and last columns are entirely one color and different, it prints 'NO' for the same reason as above.

3. **General Case:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the function prints 'YES'.
   - This is based on the idea that if the first and last rows or columns are not entirely one color or are the same color, there is a way to make the entire grid the same color by selecting appropriate subrectangles.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly identifies the cases where it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color by checking the first and last rows and columns.
- However, the function might miss some edge cases where the grid can be made uniform even if the first and last rows or columns are not entirely one color. For example, a grid where the first and last rows are not entirely one color but can still be made uniform by selecting appropriate subrectangles.

### Correctness:
- The function is correct for the given test cases and the problem constraints.
- The logic used in the function is sufficient to determine the correct output for the given examples and the problem description.

Therefore, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
