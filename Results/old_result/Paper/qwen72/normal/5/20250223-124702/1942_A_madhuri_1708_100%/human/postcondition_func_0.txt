The function reads multiple lines from standard input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. For each line, if `k` is 1 or less, it prints a list of integers from 1 to `n`. If `k` is 2 or more, it prints either `-1` if `n` is not equal to `k`, or a list of `k` integers, each equal to `k`, if `n` is equal to `k`. The function processes all lines until the end of the standard input is reached.
