The function reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `vals` from the user input. It calculates the product of all integers in `vals` and then computes a list `vprod` where each element is the product of all integers in `vals` except the corresponding integer. It also calculates `den` as the difference between the product of all integers in `vals` and the sum of the elements in `vprod`. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `-1` and returns. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing.
