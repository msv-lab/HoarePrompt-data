### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires us to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount bet on the i-th outcome.
   - We need to ensure that for all `i`, the total amount bet (`sum(x)`) is less than `k_i * x_i`.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`).
   - It then computes `vprod` where each element is `prod // r` for each `r` in `vals`. This means each `vprod[i]` is the product of all multipliers except `vals[i]`.
   - It calculates `den` as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` and returns, indicating no valid distribution of coins.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The key idea is to ensure that the total amount bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The program uses the product of all multipliers (`prod`) and divides it by each multiplier to get the bets (`vprod`).
   - The sum of `vprod` should be less than `prod` for the solution to be valid.
   - If `prod - sum(vprod) <= 0`, it means the total amount bet is not strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, and thus, no valid distribution exists.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all multipliers are the same, the program should correctly identify that no valid distribution exists (e.g., `5 5 5 5 5`).
   - If the multipliers are different, the program should find a valid distribution (e.g., `3 2 7`).

5. **Verification**:
   - For the example `3 2 7`:
     - `prod = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42`
     - `vprod = [42 // 3, 42 // 2, 42 // 7] = [14, 21, 6]`
     - `sum(vprod) = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41`
     - `den = 42 - 41 = 1` (which is greater than 0)
     - The program prints `14 21 6`, and the total bet is 41, which is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome (42, 42, 42).
   - For the example `5 5 5 5 5`:
     - `prod = 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 3125`
     - `vprod = [3125 // 5, 3125 // 5, 3125 // 5, 3125 // 5, 3125 // 5] = [625, 625, 625, 625, 625]`
     - `sum(vprod) = 625 * 5 = 3125`
     - `den = 3125 - 3125 = 0` (which is not greater than 0)
     - The program correctly prints `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a valid distribution of coins exists and prints the appropriate output. The reasoning and the edge cases are handled correctly.
