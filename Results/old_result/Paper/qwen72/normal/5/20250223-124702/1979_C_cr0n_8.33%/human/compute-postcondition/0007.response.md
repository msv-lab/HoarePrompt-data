Postcondition: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `k` is a list of n integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20), `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers read from input, `prod` is the product of all integers in `vals`, `vprod` is a list where each element is the product of all integers in `vals` except the corresponding integer in `vals`, `den` is the value of `prod - sum(vprod)`, and the current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.**
