It seems there was a mistake in the function definition provided. Based on the problem description, the function should take parameters for the number of outcomes and the multipliers for each outcome. Here is the correct function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```
def distribute_coins(t, n, k):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes for each test case, and k is a list of n integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome.**
