Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly construct a permutation `p` based on the given array `a` for each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the permutation and the array `a`.

2. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - It initializes the permutation `p` with `-1` for all positions.
   - It sets `mex` to `n`, which is the highest possible value for the MEX of the permutation at the start.
   - It iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from the last element to the first).

3. **Calculating `p[i]`**:
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`.

4. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation `p`, it prints the elements of `p`.

The logic of the program ensures that:
- `p[i]` is always a valid permutation element (i.e., it is a non-negative integer less than `n`).
- The MEX of the prefix `p[1:i+1]` is correctly calculated and used to determine `p[i]`.

The program handles the constraints and requirements of the problem description correctly. It ensures that the MEX calculation and the construction of `p` are consistent with the given `a` array. Since the problem guarantees that at least one valid permutation `p` exists for the given data, and the program constructs such a permutation, it is correct for all potential cases.
