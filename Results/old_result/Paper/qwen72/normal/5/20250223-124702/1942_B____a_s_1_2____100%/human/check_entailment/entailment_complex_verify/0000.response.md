Reasoning:

The original assessment claims that the program correctly constructs a permutation `p` based on the given array `a` for each test case. Let's analyze the program and the annotations to verify this claim.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the permutation and the array `a`.

2. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - It initializes the permutation `p` with `-1` for all positions.
   - It sets `mex` to `n`, which is the highest possible value for the MEX of the permutation at the start.
   - It iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from the last element to the first).

3. **Calculating `p[i]`**:
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`.

4. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation `p`, it prints the elements of `p`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **MEX Calculation**:
  - The MEX of a prefix `p[1:i+1]` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the prefix.
  - The program initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the highest possible value for the MEX of the permutation at the start.
  - As the program iterates in reverse, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]` and updates `mex` to the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`.

- **Consistency with `a`**:
  - The value `a[i]` is defined as `MEX(p[1:i+1]) - p[i]`.
  - By setting `p[i] = mex - a[i]`, the program ensures that `MEX(p[1:i+1])` is correctly calculated and used to determine `p[i]`.

- **Valid Permutation**:
  - The program ensures that `p[i]` is a non-negative integer less than `n` by updating `mex` to the minimum value.
  - The MEX calculation is consistent with the properties of a permutation, ensuring that all values from `0` to `n-1` are used exactly once.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

**Test Case 1**:
- Input: `5` and `1 1 -2 1 2`
- Initial state: `p = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`, `mex = 5`

  - For `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`
  - For `i = 3`: `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
  - For `i = 2`: `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`
  - For `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
  - For `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`

  - Output: `0 1 4 2 3`

  - Verification:
    - `a[0] = MEX(0) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1`
    - `a[1] = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`
    - `a[2] = MEX(0, 1, 4) - 4 = 2 - 4 = -2`
    - `a[3] = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1`
    - `a[4] = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 5 - 3 = 2`

  - The output matches the expected `a` array.

**Test Case 2**:
- Input: `5` and `1 1 1 1 1`
- Initial state: `p = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`, `mex = 5`

  - For `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = min(5, 4) = 4`
  - For `i = 3`: `p[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = min(4, 3) = 3`
  - For `i = 2`: `p[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
  - For `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
  - For `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`

  - Output: `0 1 2 3 4`

  - Verification:
    - `a[0] = MEX(0) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1`
    - `a[1] = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`
    - `a[2] = MEX(0, 1, 2) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1`
    - `a[3] = MEX(0, 1, 2, 3) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1`
    - `a[4] = MEX(0, 1, 2, 3, 4) - 4 = 5 - 4 = 1`

  - The output matches the expected `a` array.

**Test Case 3**:
- Input: `3` and `-2 1 2`
- Initial state: `p = [-1, -1, -1]`, `mex = 3`

  - For `i = 2`: `p[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`, `mex = min(3, 1) = 1`
  - For `i = 1`: `p[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
  - For `i = 0`: `p[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`, `mex = min(0, 2) = 0`

  - Output: `2 0 1`

  - Verification:
    - `a[0] = MEX(2) - 2 = 0 - 2 = -2`
    - `a[1] = MEX(2, 0) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1`
    - `a[2] = MEX(2, 0, 1) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`

  - The output matches the expected `a` array.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs a permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a` for each test case. The logic and the MEX calculation are consistent with the problem requirements, and the program handles the constraints and guarantees of the problem correctly.
