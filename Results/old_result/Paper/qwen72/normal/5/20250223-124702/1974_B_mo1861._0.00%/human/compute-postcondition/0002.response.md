To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects and variables in the loop head: `i`, `c`, and the expression `sorted(set(b))`.

1. **`i` and `c`**: These are the variables that will be assigned values during the loop. `i` will start at 0, and `c` will be the first unique character in the sorted set of `b`.

2. **`sorted(set(b))`**: This expression generates a sorted list of unique characters from the string `b`. For the loop to execute, this list must contain at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5.
- `char_map` is an empty dictionary.

We need to ensure that `sorted(set(b))` is not empty. Since `b` is a string of at least length 1, it will always contain at least one character, and thus `set(b)` will always contain at least one unique character. Therefore, `sorted(set(b))` will also contain at least one element.

So, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to:
- `i` is 0.
- `c` is the first unique character in the sorted set of `b`.
- `sorted(set(b))` must contain at least one unique character.

State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `char_map` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 0, `c` is the first unique character in the sorted set of `b`, and `sorted(set(b))` must contain at least one unique character**.
