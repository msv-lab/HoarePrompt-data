The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `b`. `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5. The function returns a new string `s` where each character in the original string `b` has been replaced by its corresponding character in the `char_map` dictionary, with the characters in `b` mapped back to the original characters in reverse sorted order.
