Output State: **b is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5. The function is defined to decode the string b, but no changes have been made to any variables or the string b itself. The function has not been called, so no value has been returned yet. `char_map` is an empty dictionary.**

The initial state remains unchanged except that `char_map` is now an empty dictionary.
