The function `func_1` accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s`. The new string `s` is created by replacing each character in `b` with a corresponding character from a mapping, where the unique characters in `b` are sorted in reverse order and mapped to the lowercase alphabet starting from 'a'. The original string `b` remains unchanged.
