You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents of the stick lengths. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        num_of_lens = {}
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        for x in nums:
            num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1
        
        res = 0
        
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
            if cnt >= 2:
                total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
                res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n` integers from the input, counts the occurrences of each integer, and calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length or 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length. The result for each test case is printed. After all iterations, the loop finishes and the final state is that `t` is unchanged, and the input has been fully processed. The variables `num_of_lens`, `nums`, and `res` are reset for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `stick_lengths`, where `t` represents the number of test cases, and each inner list contains integers representing the exponents of stick lengths. It returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the exponents of the stick lengths provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
