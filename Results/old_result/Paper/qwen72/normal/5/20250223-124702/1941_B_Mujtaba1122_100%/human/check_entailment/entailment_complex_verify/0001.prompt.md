You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
    func_2(lst, n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(list).
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: The loop does not modify the list or n. The loop will return False if any element in the list from index 0 to n-1 is non-zero. If all elements from index 0 to n-1 are zero, the loop will complete without returning False.
    return True
    #The program returns True.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `list` and a non-negative integer `n` where 0 <= n <= len(list). It checks if all elements in the list from index 0 to n-1 are zero. If any element is non-zero, the function returns `False`. If all elements from index 0 to n-1 are zero, the function returns `True`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of non-negative integers of length n, and n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
        
    #State: The list is modified such that for each i in the range 1 to n-2, if the initial conditions (list[i] > 1, list[i - 1] > 0, and list[i + 1] > 0) were met, the values of list[i], list[i - 1], and list[i + 1] are decreased according to the operations inside the while loop. If at any point list[i - 1] becomes 0, the loop prints 'no' and returns, terminating the function. If the loop completes without list[i - 1] becoming 0 for any i, the list will have been modified but will not contain any 'no' print statements.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The list is modified such that for each i in the range 1 to n-2, if the initial conditions (list[i] > 1, list[i - 1] > 0, and list[i + 1] > 0) were met, the values of list[i], list[i - 1], and list[i + 1] are decreased according to the operations inside the while loop. If at any point list[i - 1] becomes 0, the loop prints 'no' and returns, terminating the function. If the loop completes without list[i - 1] becoming 0 for any i, the list will have been modified but will not contain any 'no' print statements. Additionally, if `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`, the function indicates that the list and n satisfy the conditions checked by `func_1`. If `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`, the function indicates that the list and n do not satisfy these conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. It modifies the list such that for each index `i` in the range 1 to n-2, if the conditions `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 0` are met, the values at `list[i]`, `list[i - 1]`, and `list[i + 1]` are decreased according to specific operations. If at any point `list[i - 1]` becomes 0, the function prints 'no' and returns immediately. If the loop completes without any `list[i - 1]` becoming 0, the function calls `func_1(list, n)`. If `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value explicitly.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation.
   - The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(list, n)`**
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(list, n)`**
   - This function attempts to apply the operation to the list to make all elements zero.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to \( n-2 \) (i.e., the middle elements).
   - For each index \( i \), it checks if \( a_i \) is greater than 1 and both \( a_{i-1} \) and \( a_{i+1} \) are greater than 0.
   - If the conditions are met, it applies the operation by decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - If at any point \( a_{i-1} \) becomes zero, it prints "no" and returns.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

4. **Issues with the Program:**
   - **Incorrect Operation Application:**
     - The operation should decrement \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
     - However, the current implementation in `func_2` is incorrect. It uses `list[i - 1]` as a multiplier, which is not the correct way to apply the operation.
     - The correct operation should be:
       ```python
       list[i - 1] -= 1
       list[i] -= 2
       list[i + 1] -= 1
       ```
   - **Early Termination:**
     - The function prints "no" and returns if \( a_{i-1} \) becomes zero during the operation, which is not the correct approach. It should continue to check the entire list.
   - **Final Check:**
     - The final check using `func_1` is correct, but the function should return the result rather than printing it directly.

5. **Corrected Function 2:**
   - The corrected function should apply the operation correctly and check the entire list after all operations are applied.
   - It should return "YES" or "NO" based on the final state of the list.

### Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect due to the issues in the operation application and early termination. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] >= 2 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1
            list[i] -= 2
            list[i + 1] -= 1
    if func_1(list, n):
        return 'YES'
    else:
        return 'NO'

# Example usage:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_2(a, n))
```

This corrected version applies the operation correctly and checks the entire list after all operations are applied.
