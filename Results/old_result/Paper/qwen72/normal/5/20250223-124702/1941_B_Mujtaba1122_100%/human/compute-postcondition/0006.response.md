Postcondition: **The list is modified such that for each i in the range 1 to n-2, if the initial conditions (list[i] > 1, list[i - 1] > 0, and list[i + 1] > 0) were met, the values of list[i], list[i - 1], and list[i + 1] are decreased according to the operations inside the while loop. If at any point list[i - 1] becomes 0, the loop prints 'no' and returns, terminating the function. If the loop completes without list[i - 1] becoming 0 for any i, the list will have been modified but will not contain any 'no' print statements. Additionally, if `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`, the function indicates that the list and n satisfy the conditions checked by `func_1`. If `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`, the function indicates that the list and n do not satisfy these conditions.**
