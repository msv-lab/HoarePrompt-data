The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, and `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements. Each element in `test_cases` is a list containing an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 99).

The function processes each test case and returns a list of results. For each test case, the function returns the result of some operation performed on the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list `test_cases` of `t` elements, where each element is a list containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on some operation performed on the list of integers.**
