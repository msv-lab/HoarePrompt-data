Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails in cases where the array contains elements greater than 10 that are not in the correct position relative to their neighbors after the operation is applied.

Here is a potential case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
12 3 45 67
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output `NO` because it does not correctly handle the transformation of elements greater than 10 and their subsequent placement in the array.

The issue lies in the logic inside `func_1` where the program checks if the digits of a number greater than 10 can be inserted in the correct order. The program only checks if the tens digit (`y`) is greater than or equal to the previous element in the array (`c[n - 1]`), but it does not ensure that the entire array remains sorted after the operation. This can lead to incorrect results in cases where the array should be transformable but the program incorrectly determines it is not.

For example, in the input `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program should transform the array to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` and then check if it is sorted. However, the current logic does not correctly handle this transformation and placement, leading to an incorrect output.
