Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Global Variable `b` and Function Call `func_1()`**:
   - The program uses a global list `b` to store the results of each test case. However, the function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which would cause a `NameError` in Python.
   - The function `func_1()` should be defined before it is called.

2. **Handling of Input**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads the input for each test case, but it does not handle the input correctly. Specifically, it reads the length `k` of the array but does not use it in a meaningful way.
   - The program should read the length `k` and then read the array `a` in a single loop.

3. **Logic for Splitting Elements**:
   - The logic for splitting elements greater than 10 is flawed. The program checks if the element can be split and then inserts the digits into the array `c` in a specific order. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the element is split and needs to be inserted in the correct position to maintain the sorted order.
   - The program should ensure that after splitting, the resulting array `c` is still in non-decreasing order.

4. **Checking Sorted Order**:
   - The program checks if the array `c` is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of itself. This is a correct approach, but the logic for splitting and inserting elements needs to be fixed.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(a):
    c = []
    for num in a:
        if num > 10:
            x = num % 10
            y = num // 10
            c.extend([y, x])
        else:
            c.append(num)
    return c == sorted(c)

m = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(m):
    k = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    results.append('YES' if can_be_sorted(a) else 'NO')

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Function `can_be_sorted(a)`**:
   - This function takes an array `a` and processes each element.
   - If an element is greater than 10, it splits the element into its digits and appends them to the list `c`.
   - After processing all elements, it checks if the list `c` is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version.

2. **Main Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `k` and the array `a`.
   - It calls the `can_be_sorted(a)` function and appends the result ('YES' or 'NO') to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

This corrected program should work correctly for the given problem description.
