Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining if an array can be made non-decreasing by repeatedly applying the operation of splitting elements greater than 10 into their digits. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Function Call and Execution Order**: The function `func_1` is called twice in the main loop, but it should only be called once for each test case. The first loop calls `func_1` without storing any results, which is unnecessary and incorrect.

2. **Handling of Digits**: The program splits elements greater than 10 into their digits and appends them to the list `c` based on specific conditions. However, the conditions for appending digits are not always correct. For example, the program checks if `y >= c[n - 1]` and `y <= x` before appending `y` and `x` to `c`. This is not a sufficient condition to ensure that the array can be made non-decreasing. The correct approach would be to always split the number and check if the resulting list can be sorted.

3. **Initial Element Handling**: The program handles the first element of the array differently, which is unnecessary. The same logic should be applied to all elements, regardless of their position in the array.

4. **Sorting Check**: The program checks if the list `c` is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of itself. This is a correct approach, but the logic for constructing `c` needs to be fixed.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it stands. The logic for splitting the numbers and constructing the list `c` needs to be revised to ensure that the array can be made non-decreasing.

Correctness: **False**
