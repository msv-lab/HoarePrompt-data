Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements, each element is a list containing an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string `a` where each integer is between 0 and 99, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is 0, `c` is an empty list.** 

The code initializes an empty list `c`, and the values of the other variables remain unchanged.
