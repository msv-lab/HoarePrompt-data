Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a, b, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18. For each test case, A is int(m/a) + 1, B is int(m/b) + 1, and A + B is printed.**

Explanation:
- `t` is assigned the value of an integer input, which remains within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each of the `t` test cases:
  - `a`, `b`, and `m` are assigned the values of three integers provided as input, each within the range 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18.
  - `A` is calculated as `int(m/a) + 1`.
  - `B` is calculated as `int(m/b) + 1`.
  - The sum `A + B` is printed.
- The initial state of `t` and the ranges for `a`, `b`, and `m` remain valid, but the specific values of `a`, `b`, `m`, `A`, and `B` are updated for each test case.
