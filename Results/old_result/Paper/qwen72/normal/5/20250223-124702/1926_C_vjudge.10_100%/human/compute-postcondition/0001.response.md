Output State: **The function should take two parameters: `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) for each test case, where `n` is the largest number written on the board. `inf` is 200001. `t` is assigned the value of an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is assigned the value of an input integer using `t = int(input())`.
- The initial state specifies that `t` should be between 1 and 10^4, and this remains valid after the assignment.
- The list of integers `n` and the value of `inf` (200001) are not affected by this code snippet.
