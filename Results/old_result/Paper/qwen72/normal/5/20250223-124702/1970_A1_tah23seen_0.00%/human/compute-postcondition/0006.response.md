The code `d.pop(n)` removes the key-value pair from the dictionary `d` where the key is `n`. Given that `d[n] = 0` in the initial state, this key-value pair is removed from `d`. The other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the same non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is still an empty string, and `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` represents the depth of the balanced parentheses sequence at position `i - 1` in `s`, with `d[0] = 0` and `d[n]` is removed.**
