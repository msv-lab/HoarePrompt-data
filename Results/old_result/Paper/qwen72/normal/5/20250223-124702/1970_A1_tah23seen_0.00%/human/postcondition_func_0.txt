The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses "(", ")" with a maximum length of 500,000. It returns a new string `ans` that contains all the characters from `s` reordered based on their depth in the balanced parentheses sequence, starting from the shallowest to the deepest. The original string `s` remains unchanged.
