Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the sorting step does not break ties in decreasing order of position, which is a crucial part of the balanced shuffle operation.

Here is a counterexample:
- Input: `(()(()))`
- Expected Output: `()(()())`
- Actual Output: `(()())()`

The actual output is incorrect because the positions are not sorted in decreasing order when the prefix balances are equal. For instance, the positions with a prefix balance of 1 should be sorted as 8, 4, 2, but the program sorts them as 2, 4, 8, leading to an incorrect result.
