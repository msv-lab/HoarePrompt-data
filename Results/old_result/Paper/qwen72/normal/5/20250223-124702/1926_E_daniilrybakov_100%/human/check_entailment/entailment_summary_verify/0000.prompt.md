You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        m = 1
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2
            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The function calculates and prints an integer for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, and the input variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The loop variables `s` and `m` are reset for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s a breakdown of how it works:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
3. It initializes `s` to 0 and `m` to 1.
4. It enters a loop where it calculates `x` as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of cards that can be laid down in the current step.
5. It updates `n` to `n // 2`, effectively moving to the next step in the process.
6. It checks if `k` falls within the range of the current step (i.e., `s < k and k <= s + x`).
7. If `k` is within the current step, it breaks out of the loop.
8. It updates `s` by adding `x` to it, and multiplies `m` by 2 to move to the next step.
9. Finally, it prints the k-th card laid down, calculated as `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.

The logic correctly handles the order of laying down the cards:
- First, all odd-numbered cards.
- Next, all cards that are twice an odd number.
- Next, all cards that are three times an odd number, and so on.

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as when `n` is 1, and when `k` is the last card to be laid down. The provided test cases and the logic of the program suggest that it works correctly for all potential inputs within the given constraints.
