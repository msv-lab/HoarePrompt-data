Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the transformation of elements that are at least 10. Specifically, the program only splits the element `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and checks if the resulting list is sorted, but it does not properly insert the digits back into the array in the correct position. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where multiple elements need to be split and reinserted to achieve a sorted array.

**Counterexample:**
Consider the input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

For the first test case:
- The array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`.
- The program will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and check if `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]` is sorted, which it is.
- However, the program does not correctly handle the case where `45` needs to be split into `[4, 5]` and the array should become `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`.

For the second test case:
- The array is `[12, 28, 5]`.
- The program will split `28` into `[2, 8]` and check if `[12, 2, 8, 5]` is sorted, which it is not.
- However, the program does not correctly handle the case where `12` needs to be split into `[1, 2]` and the array should become `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`.

For the third test case:
- The array is `[0, 0]`.
- The array is already sorted, so the program will correctly print `YES`.

The program fails to handle the transformation of elements correctly and does not ensure that the array is sorted after all necessary operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
