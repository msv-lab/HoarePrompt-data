### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Initial Assumption:**
   - The function initializes `ans` to `True`, assuming that the array can be sorted.

3. **Backward Traversal:**
   - The function traverses the array from the last element to the second element (`for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`).
   - This approach is reasonable because if an array is not sorted, the first out-of-order element will be detected from the end.

4. **Splitting and Sorting Check:**
   - When the function finds an element `arr[i]` that is less than the previous element `arr[i - 1]`, it splits `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits.
   - It then checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the list is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements, it prints `YES` if `ans` is `True`, otherwise it prints `NO`.

### Issues and Analysis:
- **Splitting and Sorting Check:**
  - The function splits `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits.
  - The issue here is that the function only checks the immediate split of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]` and does not consider the possibility of splitting `arr[i - 1]` into multiple digits and then checking the entire array for sorted order.
  - For example, in the array `[12, 28, 5]`, the function will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and append `28` to it, resulting in `[1, 2, 28]`. It will then check if `[1, 2, 28]` is sorted, which it is, but it does not consider the possibility of splitting `28` into `[2, 8]` and checking the entire array `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`.

- **Example Analysis:**
  - **First Test Case:**
    - Array: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
    - After splitting the first element, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`.
    - The array is sorted, so the output should be `YES`.
  - **Second Test Case:**
    - Array: `[12, 28, 5]`
    - After splitting the first element, the array becomes `[1, 2, 28, 5]`.
    - The function will check if `[1, 2, 28]` is sorted, which it is, but it does not consider the possibility of splitting `28` into `[2, 8]` and checking the entire array `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`, which is not sorted.
  - **Third Test Case:**
    - Array: `[0, 0]`
    - The array is already sorted, so the output should be `YES`.

### Correctness:
- The provided program does not correctly handle the splitting and sorting check for the entire array. It only checks the immediate split of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`, which is insufficient to determine if the array can be sorted after all possible operations.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
