Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `m` remain unchanged: These are integers representing the number of nodes and edges, respectively.
   - `graph` is a defaultdict of lists where each key has a list of nodes it is connected to: This represents an adjacency list of the graph.
   - `edges` is now a sorted list of tuples in descending order based on the edge weights: This means the edges are sorted from the highest weight to the lowest weight.
   - `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with updated parent and min_edge values: DSU (Disjoint Set Union) is a data structure used to manage disjoint sets, and it has been updated with parent and minimum edge values.
   - `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight that was successfully added to the DSU: This is the smallest edge weight that was successfully added to the DSU.
   - `node_u` is the node u of the edge with the minimum weight that was successfully added to the DSU: This is the first node of the edge with the minimum weight.
   - `node_v` is the node v of the edge with the minimum weight that was successfully added to the DSU: This is the second node of the edge with the minimum weight.
   - `colors` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`: This list is used to store color values for nodes, initially all set to 0.
   - `res` is the result of the `dfs` function called with `node_u`, `-1`, and an empty list: This is the result of a depth-first search (DFS) starting from `node_u`, with `-1` as the parent node and an empty list to store the result.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(_min_edge, len(res))`: This statement prints the value of `_min_edge` and the length of the list `res`.

3. **Explanation of Variables:**
   - `_min_edge`: This is the minimum edge weight that was successfully added to the DSU. Since the exact value of `_min_edge` is not provided, we can only describe it as the minimum edge weight.
   - `res`: This is the result of the `dfs` function. The `dfs` function is typically used to traverse a graph and can return a list of nodes visited or a list of some other values. The length of `res` will depend on the specific implementation of the `dfs` function and the structure of the graph. Without the exact implementation of `dfs`, we can only say that `len(res)` will be the number of elements in the list returned by the `dfs` function.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output the minimum edge weight `_min_edge` and the length of the list `res`.

Output: **_min_edge, len(res) (where _min_edge is the minimum edge weight that was successfully added to the DSU, and len(res) is the number of elements in the list returned by the dfs function starting from node_u)**
