Functionality: ** The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters but initializes and uses `n`, `m`, `graph`, and `edges` internally. It constructs an undirected graph from a list of weighted edges and uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to find and union components of the graph. After processing, it prints the minimum edge weight that was successfully added to the DSU and the length of a list `res` obtained from a depth-first search (DFS) starting from a specific node. It also prints the elements of `res`. The final state of the program includes the original `n` and `m` values, a `graph` representing the constructed undirected graph, a sorted `edges` list, an updated `dsu` instance, and the printed values. **
