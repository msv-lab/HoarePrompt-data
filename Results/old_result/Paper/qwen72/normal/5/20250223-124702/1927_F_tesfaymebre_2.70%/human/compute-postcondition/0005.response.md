The only objects in the loop head are `nei` and `graph[curr]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `graph[curr]`. If `graph[curr]` is a non-empty list, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex in the DFS traversal, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal with `curr` appended to it, and the color of the current vertex `curr` is 1. For the loop to execute, `graph[curr]` must have at least one neighbor, and `nei` will be the first neighbor in `graph[curr]`.

State: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex in the DFS traversal, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal with `curr` appended to it, the color of the current vertex `curr` is 1, `graph[curr]` must have at least one neighbor, `nei` is the first neighbor in `graph[curr]`**
