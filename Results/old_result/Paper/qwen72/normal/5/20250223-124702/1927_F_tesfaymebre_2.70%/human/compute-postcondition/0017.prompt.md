You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), and graph is a defaultdict of lists representing an undirected graph, and edges is a list of tuples (w, u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n, u != v, and 1 <= w <= 10^6.
def func_6():
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
        graph[v].append(u)
        
        edges.append((w, u, v))
        
    #State: `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `graph` is a defaultdict of lists where each key has a list of nodes it is connected to, and `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges in the graph, each tuple containing the weight and the two nodes it connects.
    edges.sort(reverse=True)
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    node_u = -1
    node_v = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
            if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
                _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
                node_u = u
                node_v = v
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
        
    #State: `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `graph` is a defaultdict of lists where each key has a list of nodes it is connected to, `edges` is now a sorted list of tuples in descending order based on the edge weights, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with updated parent and min_edge values, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight that was successfully added to the DSU, `node_u` is the node u of the edge with the minimum weight that was successfully added to the DSU, `node_v` is the node v of the edge with the minimum weight that was successfully added to the DSU.
    colors = [0] * (n + 1)
    res = dfs(node_u, -1, [])
    print(_min_edge, len(res))
    #This is printed: - The print statement will output the minimum edge weight `_min_edge` and the length of the list `res`.
    #
    #Output:
    print(*res)
    #This is printed: [elements of res] (where res is the result of the dfs function called with node_u, -1, and an empty list)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `graph`, and `edges`. It processes these inputs to return a result, but the specific return value is not defined in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
