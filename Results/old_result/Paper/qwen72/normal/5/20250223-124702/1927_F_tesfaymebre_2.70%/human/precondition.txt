This function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The function should accept parameters for the graph's vertices, edges, and weights, and the number of test cases. A correct function definition would be something like: `def find_min_lightest_edge_cycle(t, n, m, edges):` where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of vertices, `m` is the number of edges, and `edges` is a list of tuples, each containing the vertices `u`, `v` and the weight `w` of an edge.
