Functionality: ** The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves a number of test cases by calling `func_1()`, and then iterates that many times, calling `func_6()` in each iteration. After the function concludes, the value of `test_cases` remains unchanged, and the function does not return any value. **
