### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Graph Construction**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges `m`.
   - It then reads the edges and constructs an adjacency list `graph` and a list of edges `edges` with their weights.
   - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight, which is a key step for finding the minimum weight edge in a cycle.

2. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to manage the connected components of the graph.
   - This is used to detect cycles and to keep track of the minimum weight edge in each component.

3. **Cycle Detection and Minimum Weight Edge**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges and uses the DSU to union the vertices connected by each edge.
   - The condition `if parent_u == parent_v` is used to detect a cycle. However, this condition is incorrect. It should be `if parent_u != parent_v` to union the vertices and update the minimum weight edge.
   - The program updates the minimum weight edge and the corresponding vertices `node_u` and `node_v` when a cycle is detected, but this logic is flawed. The correct approach should be to update the minimum weight edge during the union operation, not when a cycle is detected.

4. **Depth-First Search (DFS) for Cycle**:
   - The DFS function is intended to find the cycle that includes the vertices `node_u` and `node_v`.
   - The `colors` array is used to track the state of each vertex during the DFS: 0 for unvisited, 1 for visiting, and 2 for visited.
   - The current implementation of the DFS function is incorrect. It should return the cycle only when it finds a back edge to a vertex that is already in the path. The current implementation may return a path that is not a cycle or may not return the correct cycle.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum weight edge and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.
   - However, due to the issues in the cycle detection and DFS, the output may be incorrect.

### Issues and Concerns:
- **Cycle Detection Logic**:
  - The condition `if parent_u == parent_v` should be `if parent_u != parent_v` to union the vertices and update the minimum weight edge.
  - The program should update the minimum weight edge during the union operation, not when a cycle is detected.

- **DFS Cycle Extraction**:
  - The DFS function is not correctly extracting the cycle. It should return the cycle only when it finds a back edge to a vertex that is already in the path.
  - The current implementation may return a path that is not a cycle or may not return the correct cycle.

- **DSU Data Structure**:
  - The DSU class is not defined in the provided code. It is assumed to have methods `find` and `union` and a `min_edge` attribute, but the implementation details are missing.
  - Without the correct implementation of the DSU, the program cannot function as intended.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
