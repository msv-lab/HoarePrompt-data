To determine what will be printed by the `print(*res)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
   - `graph` is a `defaultdict` of lists where each key has a list of nodes it is connected to.
   - `edges` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order based on the edge weights.
   - `dsu` is an instance of the DSU (Disjoint Set Union) class with updated parent and min_edge values.
   - `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight that was successfully added to the DSU.
   - `node_u` is the node u of the edge with the minimum weight that was successfully added to the DSU.
   - `node_v` is the node v of the edge with the minimum weight that was successfully added to the DSU.
   - `colors` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`.
   - `res` is the result of the `dfs` function called with `node_u`, `-1`, and an empty list.

2. **Understanding the `dfs` function:**
   - The `dfs` function is typically used to perform a depth-first search on a graph.
   - It is called with `node_u` as the starting node, `-1` as the parent node (indicating no parent initially), and an empty list to store the result.
   - The `dfs` function likely traverses the graph starting from `node_u` and collects some information or results in the `res` list.

3. **Output of the `dfs` function:**
   - The exact output of the `dfs` function depends on its implementation, which is not provided.
   - However, based on the typical use of `dfs`, the `res` list might contain nodes visited, paths, or some other relevant information.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(*res)` statement will unpack the list `res` and print its elements separated by spaces.

Given the initial state and the typical behavior of a `dfs` function, the output will be the elements of the `res` list, which are the results of the depth-first search starting from `node_u`.

Output: **[elements of res] (where res is the result of the dfs function called with node_u, -1, and an empty list)**

If you can provide more details about the `dfs` function, I can give a more precise description of the elements in `res`.
