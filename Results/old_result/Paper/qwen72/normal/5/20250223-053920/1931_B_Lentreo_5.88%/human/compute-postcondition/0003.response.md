The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all elements in `a` is divisible by `n`.

Given these constraints, the function is expected to return some value based on the input parameters. However, the specific output is not provided in the example, so I will describe the parameters and the expected behavior in a general sense.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n`, an integer between 1 and 2 · 10^5, and `a`, a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and 10^9. The sum of all elements in `a` is divisible by `n`. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not specified in the provided information.**
