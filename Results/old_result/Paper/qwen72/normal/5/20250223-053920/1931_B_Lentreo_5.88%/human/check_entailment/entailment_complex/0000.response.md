Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index. The key insight here is that if the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, it is always possible to achieve equal amounts of water in each container, given that the operation allows water to be moved from any container to any other container with a higher index.

However, the provided program does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it calculates the difference between each non-zero element in the list `nums` and the last element in the list, and checks if the sum of these differences is zero. This approach is flawed because:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Equality Check**: The program is checking if the sum of the differences between each non-zero element and the last element is zero. This does not ensure that all elements in the list can be made equal. For example, consider the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The last element is `4`, and the differences are `1-4`, `2-4`, `3-4`, and `4-4`. The sum of these differences is `-4`, which is not zero, but it is possible to make all elements equal by pouring water from higher-indexed containers to lower-indexed containers.

2. **Ignoring the Sum Condition**: The problem guarantees that the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers. This means that the average amount of water per container is an integer, and it is always possible to make all containers have this average amount of water by pouring water from containers with more water to containers with less water. The program does not use this information.

3. **Misunderstanding the Operation**: The operation allows pouring water from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index. The program does not correctly simulate this operation or check if it can be used to equalize the water levels.

Given these issues, the program will produce incorrect results for many test cases. For example, the test case `[4, 5, 2, 1, 3]` should output `YES` because it is possible to equalize the water levels, but the program will output `NO`.

Correctness: **False**
