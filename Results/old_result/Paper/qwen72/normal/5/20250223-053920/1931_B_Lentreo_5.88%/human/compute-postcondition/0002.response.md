Output State: **The loop iterates t times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer n and a list of n integers (nums). It then calculates the difference between each non-zero element in nums and the last element in nums, accumulating these differences in curr. If curr is 0 after the inner loop, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The values of t, n, and a remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.**
