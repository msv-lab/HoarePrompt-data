The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `j`, and the list `d`. For the loop to execute, the list `d` must contain at least one tuple. The variables `i` and `j` will be assigned the values from the first tuple in `d` at the start of the first iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is an empty string.
- `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the depth values in ascending order, where each tuple is of the form (index, depth) for indices from 1 to `n-1` and the corresponding depth values.

To ensure the loop can execute, `d` must have at least one tuple. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `d` is not empty and that `i` and `j` are assigned the values from the first tuple in `d`.

State: **`ans` is an empty string, `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the depth values in ascending order that must have at least one tuple, `i` is the index from the first tuple in `d`, `j` is the depth from the first tuple in `d`**
