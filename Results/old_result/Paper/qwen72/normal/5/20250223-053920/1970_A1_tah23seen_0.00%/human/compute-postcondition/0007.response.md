The code snippet `d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])` sorts the dictionary `d` based on the values of its items (i.e., the depths of the balanced parentheses sequence) and assigns the sorted list of tuples back to `d`.

Output State: **`ans` is an empty string; `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the depth values in ascending order, where each tuple is of the form (index, depth) for indices from 1 to `n-1` and the corresponding depth values.**
