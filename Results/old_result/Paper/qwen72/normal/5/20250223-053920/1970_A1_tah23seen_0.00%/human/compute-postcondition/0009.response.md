To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's break down the given information and the loop logic:

### Initial State:
- `ans` is an empty string.
- `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the depth values in ascending order. Each tuple is of the form (index, depth) for indices from 1 to `n-1` and the corresponding depth values.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i, j in d:
    ans += s[i]
```

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each tuple `(i, j)` in the list `d`.
- For each tuple, the loop appends the character at index `i` from the string `s` to the string `ans`.
- The variable `j` (depth) is not used in the loop body, so it does not affect the outcome.

### Output State:
- After the loop finishes, `ans` will be a string containing the characters from `s` at the indices specified in the first element of each tuple in `d`, in the order of the tuples in `d`.

### Natural Language Description:
- The string `ans` will be constructed by concatenating the characters from `s` at the indices specified in the first element of each tuple in `d`, in the order of the tuples in `d`.

Output State: **`ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` at the indices specified in the first element of each tuple in `d`, in the order of the tuples in `d`.**
