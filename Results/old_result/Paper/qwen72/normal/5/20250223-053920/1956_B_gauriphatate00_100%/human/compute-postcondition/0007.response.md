The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `n`. `a` is a list of integers where each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function returns the number of integers from 1 to n that appear exactly twice in the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers and a positive integer `n`. It returns the count of integers from 1 to n that appear exactly twice in the list `a`.**
