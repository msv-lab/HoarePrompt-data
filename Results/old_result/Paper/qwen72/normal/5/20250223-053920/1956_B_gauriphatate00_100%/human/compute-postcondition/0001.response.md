The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `count_a` is an empty dictionary, which does not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the list `a` must have at least one integer, and `num` will be the first integer in the list.

State: **`a` is a list of integers where each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice, and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` must have at least one integer, `num` is the first integer in the list, `count_a` is an empty dictionary**
