Output State: **For each test case, the loop prints the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of the modified `nums` list. The `nums` list initially contains powers of 2 from 1 to \(2^{23}\). After the loop, it contains the same elements as before, but with the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) removed and three new elements appended: \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\). The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `n` and `k` are re-assigned for each test case.**
