### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `nums`**:
   - The list `nums` is initialized with powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). This ensures that `nums` contains 24 elements, which is within the limit of 25 elements.

2. **Finding the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`**:
   - The loop `while k >= 1 << idx:` finds the largest index `idx` such that \(2^{\text{idx}} \leq k\). This is correct because it effectively finds the highest bit set in `k`.

3. **Modifying `nums`**:
   - The element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed from `nums`.
   - Three new elements are appended to `nums`: \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\).

4. **Ensuring no subsequence sums to `k`**:
   - By removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\) and adding \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), the program ensures that no subsequence of `nums` can sum to `k`. This is because the sum of any subsequence that includes \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\) and any combination of the remaining elements will not equal `k`.

5. **Ensuring all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) are possible**:
   - The elements \(k + 1\) and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\) are added to ensure that all sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed. The addition of \(k + 1\) and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\) ensures that the sums can be formed by combining the new elements with the remaining elements in `nums`.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of the list, which is correct according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a sequence `nums` that meets the problem's requirements for each test case. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` and that all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed. The sequence is also within the size limit of 25 elements.

### Correctness:
**True**
