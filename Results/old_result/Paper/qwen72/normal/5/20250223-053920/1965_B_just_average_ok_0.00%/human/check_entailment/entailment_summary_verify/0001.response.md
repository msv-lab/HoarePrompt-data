### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires constructing a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v` is not equal to `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Initial Sequence Construction:**
   - The program starts by creating a sequence `nums` of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). This sequence has 24 elements, and it ensures that any number in the range `[1, 2^24 - 1]` can be represented as a sum of a subsequence of these numbers.

3. **Adjusting the Sequence:**
   - The program identifies the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and removes it from the sequence.
   - It then appends three new elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - The purpose of removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is to ensure that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence of the remaining numbers.
   - The new elements are chosen to ensure that all other sums in the range `[1, n]` can still be formed.

4. **Verification:**
   - **No Subsequence Sums to `k`:**
     - By removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\), the program ensures that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence of the remaining numbers. This is because `k` is expressed as a sum of powers of 2, and removing one of these powers of 2 breaks the ability to form `k`.
     - The new elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` are chosen such that they do not form `k` with any other elements in the sequence.
   - **All Other Sums in Range `[1, n]`:**
     - The sequence still contains all powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\) except for the one removed.
     - The added elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` help in forming all other sums in the range `[1, n]` that are not equal to `k`.
     - Specifically, `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` ensure that sums greater than `k` can be formed, and `k - nums[idx]` helps in forming sums less than `k` that were previously dependent on the removed power of 2.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is a power of 2 by removing the exact power of 2 and adding the necessary numbers to ensure all other sums are possible.
   - The program ensures that the sequence size does not exceed 25, which is within the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while still allowing all other sums in the range `[1, n]`.

Final: **True**
