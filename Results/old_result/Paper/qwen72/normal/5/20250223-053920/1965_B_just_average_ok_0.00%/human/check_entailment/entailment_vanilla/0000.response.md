### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v` is not equal to `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Initial Sequence Construction:**
   - The program starts by creating a sequence `nums` of powers of 2 up to `2^23` (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^23]`).
   - This sequence has the property that any number in the range `[1, 2^24 - 1]` can be represented as a sum of a subsequence of these numbers (since they are the binary digits).

3. **Adjusting the Sequence:**
   - The program then finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and removes it from the sequence.
   - It appends three new numbers to the sequence: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - The idea is to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` while still allowing all other sums in the range `[1, n]`.

4. **Verification:**
   - **No Subsequence Sums to `k`:**
     - By removing the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, the program ensures that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence of the remaining numbers.
     - The new numbers added are designed to avoid forming `k` while still covering all other sums.
   - **All Other Sums in Range `[1, n]`:**
     - The sequence still contains all powers of 2 up to `2^23` except for the one removed.
     - The added numbers `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` help in forming all other sums in the range `[1, n]` that are not equal to `k`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is a power of 2 by removing the exact power of 2 and adding the necessary numbers to ensure all other sums are possible.
   - The program also ensures that the sequence size does not exceed 25, which is within the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while still allowing all other sums in the range `[1, n]`.

Correctness: **True**
