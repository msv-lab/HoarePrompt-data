Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it determines and prints whether it is possible to rearrange the cubes such that the sum of the values of any `k` consecutive cubes is at least `f`, based on the conditions: if there are at least `k` values greater than the favorite value, it prints 'YES'; if the sum of values equal to and greater than the favorite value is less than or equal to `k`, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variables `t` and `test_cases` (if they were defined externally) remain unchanged, while the internal variables `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, `favorite_value`, `same_value_count`, and `greater_count` will hold the values from the last test case processed. **
