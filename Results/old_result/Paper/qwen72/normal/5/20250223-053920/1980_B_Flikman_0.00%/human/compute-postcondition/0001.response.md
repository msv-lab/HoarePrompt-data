The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will start from 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`t` must be an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0**
