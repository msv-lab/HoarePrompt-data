Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of test cases, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers read from the input, `prod` is the product of all integers in the list `vals`, `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of `prod // r` for each `r` in `vals`.**

Explanation:
- The code creates a new list `vprod` where each element is the integer division of `prod` by each element `r` in the list `vals`.
- The values of `t`, `cases`, `N`, `vals`, and `prod` remain unchanged.
- `vprod` is now a list with the same length as `vals`, where each element is the result of `prod // r` for the corresponding `r` in `vals`.
