Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Bets**:
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`) and then divides this product by each multiplier to get the bet amounts (`vprod`). This approach does not ensure that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - The correct approach should be to find a set of bets such that the total sum of bets is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This can be achieved by setting the bets in a way that the sum of all bets is less than the minimum value of `k_i * x_i` for any `i`.

2. **Incorrect Denominator Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `den` as `prod - sum(vprod)`. This is not a valid way to determine if a solution exists. The correct condition to check is whether the sum of the bets is less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program should output the bets for each test case, but it incorrectly prints the bets in a way that may not satisfy the problem's constraints.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, you can use the following approach:

1. **Calculate the Total Sum of Bets**:
   - For each outcome, the bet should be such that the total sum of bets is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - One simple way to achieve this is to set the bet for each outcome to be the product of all other multipliers divided by the current multiplier. This ensures that the total sum of bets is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

2. **Check for Validity**:
   - Ensure that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. If this is not possible, output `-1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    
    # Calculate the product of all multipliers
    prod = 1
    for r in vals:
        prod *= r
    
    # Calculate the bets for each outcome
    bets = [prod // r for r in vals]
    
    # Calculate the total sum of bets
    total_bets = sum(bets)
    
    # Check if the total sum of bets is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome
    if all(total_bets < k * x for k, x in zip(vals, bets)):
        print(' '.join(map(str, bets)))
    else:
        print(-1)

cases = int(input().strip())
for _ in range(cases):
    func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Product Calculation**:
   - `prod` is the product of all multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Bets Calculation**:
   - `bets` is a list where each element is the product of all other multipliers divided by the current multiplier. This ensures that the total sum of bets is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

3. **Validity Check**:
   - The program checks if the total sum of bets is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome using the condition `all(total_bets < k * x for k, x in zip(vals, bets))`.

4. **Output**:
   - If the condition is satisfied, the program prints the bets. Otherwise, it prints `-1`.

This corrected approach ensures that the program meets the problem's requirements and produces the correct output.
