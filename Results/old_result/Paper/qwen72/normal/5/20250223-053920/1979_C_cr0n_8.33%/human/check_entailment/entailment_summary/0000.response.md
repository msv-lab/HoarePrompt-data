Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `N` and the list of multipliers `vals`.

2. **Product Calculation**: The program calculates the product of all multipliers in `vals`. This step is necessary to ensure that the bets are distributed in a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

3. **Bet Calculation**: The program computes the list `vprod` where each element is the product divided by the corresponding multiplier. This ensures that the bet on each outcome is proportional to the product of the other multipliers.

4. **Denominator Calculation**: The program calculates `den` as the product minus the sum of the elements in `vprod`. This step is crucial to check if the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it means the total amount of coins bet is not strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, and thus, the program prints `-1`.

5. **Output**: If `den` is greater than 0, the program prints the space-separated list of bets `vprod`. This ensures that the solution meets the problem's requirements.

However, there is a potential issue with the approach:

- **Product Calculation**: The product of all multipliers can become very large, especially when `N` is large and the multipliers are in the range [2, 20]. This can lead to integer overflow or very large numbers that might not be practical to handle in some environments.

- **Correctness of Bets**: The bets calculated as `prod // r` for each multiplier `r` ensure that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for the winning outcome. However, the program does not explicitly check if the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. This is implicitly handled by the condition `den > 0`.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program's approach is mathematically sound and should work correctly for the given inputs. The only potential issue is the handling of very large numbers, but this is a common approach in such problems and should be within the limits of Python's integer handling.

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to distribute the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, and it handles cases where no such distribution is possible by printing `-1`.
