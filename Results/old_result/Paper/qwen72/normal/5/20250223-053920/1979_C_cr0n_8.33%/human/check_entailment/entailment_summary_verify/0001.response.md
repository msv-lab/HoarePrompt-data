### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`N`) and the multipliers for each outcome (`vals`).

2. **Solution Approach**:
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`).
   - It then computes the value `vprod` for each outcome, which is the product of all multipliers divided by the multiplier for that outcome.
   - The denominator `den` is calculated as the product of all multipliers minus the sum of the `vprod` values.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` and returns, indicating that no valid distribution of coins is possible.
   - Otherwise, it prints the `vprod` values as the bets for each outcome.

3. **Mathematical Validity**:
   - The approach is based on the idea that the total bet should be less than the return for any winning outcome.
   - The total bet is the sum of the `vprod` values.
   - The return for the i-th outcome is `k_i * vprod[i]`.
   - The program ensures that `k_i * vprod[i] > sum(vprod)` for all i, which is the required condition.
   - This is mathematically valid because `vprod[i] = prod // k_i`, and `prod` is the product of all `k_i` values. Therefore, `k_i * vprod[i] = k_i * (prod // k_i) = prod`, and the total bet is `sum(vprod) = sum(prod // k_i)`. For the condition to hold, `prod` must be greater than `sum(prod // k_i)`, which is checked by `den = prod - sum(vprod)`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all multipliers are the same, the sum of `vprod` values will be `n * (prod // k_i)`, and `prod - sum(vprod)` will be `prod - n * (prod // k_i)`.
   - If `k_i` is the same for all outcomes, the program will correctly identify that no valid distribution exists if `prod - n * (prod // k_i) <= 0`.
   - For example, if all `k_i` are 5, then `prod = 5^n` and `sum(vprod) = n * (5^n // 5) = n * 5^(n-1)`. The condition `5^n > n * 5^(n-1)` simplifies to `5 > n`, which is true only for `n < 5`. For `n >= 5`, the program will correctly print `-1`.

5. **Output Constraints**:
   - The program ensures that the bets `x_i` are integers and within the range `1 \le x_i \le 10^9`.
   - The values in `vprod` are calculated as `prod // k_i`, which are always integers and positive since `k_i` is at least 2.
   - The values are also within the range `1 \le x_i \le 10^9` because the product of up to 50 multipliers (each up to 20) is manageable and the division by `k_i` keeps the values within the required bounds.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the correct logic and handles the problem as described. It correctly identifies when a valid distribution is possible and when it is not. The mathematical approach is sound and the implementation is correct.

### Correctness:
