Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the multipliers are all the same and equal to the number of outcomes. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```

The program will calculate the product of all multipliers, which is \(5^5 = 3125\). Then it will calculate the values `vprod` as \(3125 / 5 = 625\) for each multiplier. The sum of `vprod` is \(625 \times 5 = 3125\). The denominator `den` will be \(3125 - 3125 = 0\), and the program will print `-1`.

However, a valid solution exists for this case. For example, you can bet 1 coin on each outcome, and the total bet is 5 coins. If any outcome wins, you will receive \(5 \times 1 = 5\) coins, which is equal to the total bet, not strictly greater. Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to find a valid solution for this case.
