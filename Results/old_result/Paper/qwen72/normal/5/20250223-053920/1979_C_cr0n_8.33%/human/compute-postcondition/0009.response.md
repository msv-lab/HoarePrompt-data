Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `cases` is a list of test cases.
   - `N` is an input integer.
   - `vals` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `prod` is the product of all integers in the list `vals`.
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of `prod // r` for each `r` in `vals`.
   - `den` is the value of `prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - The current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
   - The value of `den` being less than or equal to 0 is a condition that is already satisfied, and it does not affect the execution of the `print` statement.
   - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.

4. **Output:**
   - The code will print the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
