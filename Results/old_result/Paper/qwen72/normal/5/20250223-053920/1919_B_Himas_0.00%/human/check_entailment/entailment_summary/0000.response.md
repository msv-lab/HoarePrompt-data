Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` and prints this difference. However, the problem requires calculating the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from `s` into non-empty subarrays and then summing the penalties of these subarrays.

The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The optimal way to minimize the penalty is to split the array such that each subarray has a sum of zero, if possible. If not, the subarrays should be split to minimize the absolute sum of each subarray.

The program's approach of simply printing the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters does not account for the optimal splitting of the array, and thus does not compute the correct minimum penalty.

For example, in the third test case where `s = "+-+-+-"`, the correct minimum penalty is 0, which can be achieved by splitting the array into `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`. The program, however, would output `0` because it calculates `P - M` (3 - 3 = 0), which is not the correct way to compute the penalty.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
