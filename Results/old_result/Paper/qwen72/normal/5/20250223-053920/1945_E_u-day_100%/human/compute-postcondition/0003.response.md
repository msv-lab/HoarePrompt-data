The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must start at 0. The other variables (`k`, `arr`, and `pos`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
