Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned new values by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is -1.**

The code snippet `pos = -1` sets the variable `pos` to -1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `arr`) remain unchanged, maintaining their values as described in the initial state. The value of `pos` is now explicitly -1, indicating that if `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` will remain -1. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` will be updated later, but based on the given code snippet, `pos` is currently set to -1.
