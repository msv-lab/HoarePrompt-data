The code snippet `n, k = func_1()` assigns new values to `n` and `k` based on the return values of the function `func_1`. The initial values of `n` and `k` are replaced by the values returned from `func_1`. The other variables, `arr` and `pos`, are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned new values by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1.**
