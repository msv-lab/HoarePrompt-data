Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned new values by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is the index of `k` in the new `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr = func_2()` updates the value of `arr` to the list returned by `func_2()`. The values of `n` and `k` are still assigned by `func_1()`, and `pos` is still determined based on the presence of `k` in `arr`. However, since `arr` has been updated, `pos` will now reflect the index of `k` in the new list, or -1 if `k` is not present in the new list.
