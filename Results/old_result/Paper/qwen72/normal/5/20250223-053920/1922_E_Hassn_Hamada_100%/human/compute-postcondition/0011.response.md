Output State: **`number` remains the same, `sequence` is a list of integers with the original elements followed by integers from `overlap` to `size - 1`, `size` remains the same, `overlap` remains the same, and `func_1` is called with the argument `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)` and the list `sequence`.**
