### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The subsequences can be formed by removing elements from the array while maintaining the order of the remaining elements.
   - The array elements should be within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` to generate the required array.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to construct the array by recursively breaking down the number \( X \) into smaller parts and appending elements to the sequence.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `number` (which is \( X - 1 \)) and `sequence` (the list to which elements will be appended).
   - It uses a loop to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `number`.
   - It then appends a sequence of integers to the `sequence` list and recursively calls itself with the remaining part of `number`.

4. **Key Observations**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that has a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - The use of powers of 2 is crucial because the number of increasing subsequences in a sequence of \( n \) distinct elements is \( 2^n \).
   - The function ensures that the sequence is constructed in such a way that the number of increasing subsequences matches the given \( X \).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( X = 2 \) by printing a sequence of length 1 with a single element.
   - For larger values of \( X \), the function `func_1` is called recursively to break down the problem into smaller subproblems.

6. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly generates a sequence of integers that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The length of the generated sequence is within the limit of 200.
   - The elements of the sequence are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correctly designed to solve the problem as described. It uses a recursive approach to generate the required sequence and ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches the given \( X \).

Correctness: **True**
