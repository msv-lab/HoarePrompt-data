The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`. Both `main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing item prices for Alice and Bob, respectively. The function returns the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the first and second elements is non-negative.

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of tuples, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, and returns the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the first and second elements is non-negative.**
