The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `start` and `end` does not directly affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted. Before the loop starts, `i` is not yet defined, and for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers where 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
