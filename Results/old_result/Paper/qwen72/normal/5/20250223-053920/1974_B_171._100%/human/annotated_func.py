#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(encoded):

    #State: Output State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character from `encoded` is mapped to the corresponding character from the end of the `unique_chars` list, in reverse order. The `unique_chars` list remains unchanged, and `len_unique` remains the same as the length of `unique_chars`.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns the string `decoded` where each character from `encoded` has been replaced by the corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` in reverse order, as mapped by `char_map`. The `unique_chars` list and `len_unique` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a string `decoded`. The `decoded` string is created by replacing each character in `encoded` with the corresponding character from the end of the sorted unique characters of `encoded`, in reverse order. The original `encoded` string and the internal state of the function (such as `unique_chars` and `len_unique`) remain unchanged after the function execution.
