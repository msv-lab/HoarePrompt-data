The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a string `decoded`. The `decoded` string is created by replacing each character in `encoded` with the corresponding character from the end of the sorted unique characters of `encoded`, in reverse order. The original `encoded` string and the internal state of the function (such as `unique_chars` and `len_unique`) remain unchanged after the function execution.
