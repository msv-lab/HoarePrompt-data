Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly follows the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It constructs a new auxiliary string `r` from the distinct letters of the encoded string `b` in alphabetical order, then creates a mapping where each character in `b` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r`. The program handles the input and output format as specified, including multiple test cases. No edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would cause the program to fail to decode the string correctly.
