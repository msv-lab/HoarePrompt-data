The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `len_unique`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `len_unique`. If `len_unique` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`, `char_map` is an empty dictionary, and `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`. For the loop to execute, `len_unique` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be 0.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`, `char_map` is an empty dictionary, `len_unique` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
