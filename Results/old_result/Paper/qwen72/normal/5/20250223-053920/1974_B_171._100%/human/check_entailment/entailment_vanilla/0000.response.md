### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input in a loop, extracting the number of test cases `t`, the length of each encoded string `n`, and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - For each test case, the program extracts the encoded string `b`.
   - It creates a set of unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them to form the auxiliary string `r`.
   - It then creates a dictionary `char_map` to map each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
   - Finally, it decodes the string by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

3. **Output:**
   - The decoded strings are stored in a list `results` and printed one by one after all test cases are processed.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The program correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them to form the auxiliary string `r`.
  - The mapping of characters in `r` to their symmetric characters is done correctly.
  - The decoding process, which involves replacing each character in the encoded string with its symmetric character, is also implemented correctly.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles single-character strings correctly.
  - It also handles strings with repeated characters correctly by ensuring that the mapping is consistent.

- **Performance:**
  - The program efficiently processes the input and performs the decoding in linear time relative to the length of the string, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
