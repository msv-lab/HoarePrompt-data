The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is a placeholder for the loop index, and the variable `T`, which is the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0. The state of `func` and the input details do not affect the loop head directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
