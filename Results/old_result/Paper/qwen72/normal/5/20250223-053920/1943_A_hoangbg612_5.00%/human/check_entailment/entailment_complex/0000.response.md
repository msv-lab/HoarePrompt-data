Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting**: The array `N` is sorted, which is a good approach to ensure that we can process the elements in increasing order.

3. **Dictionary Initialization**: The dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the counts of each integer in the array `N`.

4. **Processing the Array**:
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to -1, which is used to track the current MEX.
   - The loop iterates through each element in the sorted array `N`.
   - If the current element `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop, as this means the MEX has been found.
   - If `num` is equal to `cur + 1`, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
   - If `num` is equal to `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

5. **Final MEX Calculation**:
   - After processing the array, the function checks if the sum of the counts in `M` is equal to `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1, which is incorrect because `cur` should be the MEX of the array `c` and not a function of the sum of counts.
   - The function then iterates from 0 to `cur` and checks if `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`. If this condition is violated, it updates `cur` to `i` and breaks the loop. This step is intended to find the MEX, but it is not correctly implemented.

6. **Output**: The function prints the final value of `cur` for each test case.

**Issues**:
- The step `if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S: cur += 1` is incorrect. The MEX is determined by the smallest non-negative integer not in the array, not by the sum of counts.
- The loop `for i in range(cur): if M[i] <= i: cur = i; break` is also incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest integer `i` that is not in the array `c`, not the smallest integer where the count of `i` is less than or equal to `i`.

**Correct Approach**:
- The correct approach to find the MEX is to iterate through the sorted array and keep track of the smallest integer that is not present in the array `c`.

Given the issues in the final MEX calculation, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
