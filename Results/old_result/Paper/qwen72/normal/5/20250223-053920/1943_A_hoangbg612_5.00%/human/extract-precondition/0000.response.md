Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to be called with parameters in a context where the input is provided through standard input or a similar mechanism, as it does not take any arguments directly. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n). The total number of test cases, t, is also provided, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, and it is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
