The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `tests`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `tests`. If `tests` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `a`, `b`, `c` are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
