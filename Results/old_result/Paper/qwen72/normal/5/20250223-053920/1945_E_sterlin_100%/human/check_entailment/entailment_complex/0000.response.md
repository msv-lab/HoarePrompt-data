Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `x` using `func_2()`, and the permutation `p` using `func_3()`. These functions are designed to handle input in the specified format and are used appropriately.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic is implemented correctly. The loop continues until `left + 1 < right`, and the midpoint `mid` is calculated as `left + (right - left) // 2`. The elements are compared, and `left` or `right` are updated accordingly.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - If `p[left]` is equal to `x` after the binary search, the program correctly outputs `0` (no swaps needed).
   - If `x` is not in the `seen` array, the program outputs `1` and swaps the element at position `left + 1` with the element at the position of `x` in the permutation.
   - If `x` is in the `seen` array but not at `p[left]`, the program outputs `2` and performs two swaps to ensure `p[left]` is equal to `x`.

4. **Correctness of Swaps**:
   - The first swap is designed to move `x` to a position that can be reached by the binary search.
   - The second swap is designed to correct the position of `x` if it was moved to an incorrect position by the first swap.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position (`p[left] == x`).
   - It also handles the case where `x` is not in the `seen` array, ensuring that it is moved to the correct position with a single swap.
   - The case where `x` is in the `seen` array but not at `p[left]` is handled by performing two swaps to correct the position.

6. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program correctly identifies the positions of elements in the permutation using a dictionary `num_indx`.
   - The `seen` array is used to track which elements have been considered in the binary search.
   - The logic for determining the number of swaps and the positions to swap is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to meet the problem requirements and handle all specified cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
