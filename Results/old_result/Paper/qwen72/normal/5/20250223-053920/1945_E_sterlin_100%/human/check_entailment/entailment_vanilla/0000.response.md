Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
   - We need to perform at most 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation so that a binary search can find `x` at the correct position.
   - The binary search algorithm is described, and it is guaranteed that 2 operations are always sufficient.

2. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - Each test case consists of:
     - Two integers `n` and `x`.
     - A permutation `p` of length `n`.

3. **Binary Search Algorithm**:
   - The binary search algorithm is correctly described in the problem statement.
   - The algorithm initializes `l` to 1 and `r` to `n + 1`.
   - It then iterates, updating `m` as the midpoint and adjusting `l` or `r` based on the comparison of `p[m]` with `x`.

4. **Swapping Operations**:
   - The goal is to perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that the binary search will find `x` at the correct position.
   - The program needs to determine the positions of `x` in the permutation and the positions of the elements that need to be swapped to achieve the correct order for binary search.

5. **Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program consists of several functions for input handling:
     - `func_1()`: Reads a single integer.
     - `func_2()`: Reads and maps a list of integers.
     - `func_3()`: Reads and returns a list of integers.
     - `func_4()`: Reads a single line of input.
     - `func_5()`: Splits a line of input into a list of strings.
   - However, the program does not implement the actual logic to solve the problem. It only provides input handling functions.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program is incomplete and does not contain the logic to solve the problem as described.
   - It lacks the implementation of the binary search algorithm and the logic to perform the necessary swaps.

Correctness: **False**
