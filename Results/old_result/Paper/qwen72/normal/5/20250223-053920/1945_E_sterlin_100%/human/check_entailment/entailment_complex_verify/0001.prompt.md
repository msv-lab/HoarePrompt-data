You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
   - We need to perform at most 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation so that a binary search can find `x` at the correct position.
   - The binary search algorithm is described, and it is guaranteed that 2 operations are always sufficient.

2. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - Each test case consists of:
     - Two integers `n` and `x`.
     - A permutation `p` of length `n`.

3. **Binary Search Algorithm**:
   - The binary search algorithm is correctly described in the problem statement.
   - The algorithm initializes `l` to 1 and `r` to `n + 1`.
   - It then iterates, updating `m` as the midpoint and adjusting `l` or `r` based on the comparison of `p[m]` with `x`.

4. **Swapping Operations**:
   - The goal is to perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that the binary search will find `x` at the correct position.
   - The program needs to determine the positions of `x` in the permutation and the positions of the elements that need to be swapped to achieve the correct order for binary search.

5. **Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program consists of several functions for input handling:
     - `func_1()`: Reads a single integer.
     - `func_2()`: Reads and maps a list of integers.
     - `func_3()`: Reads and returns a list of integers.
     - `func_4()`: Reads a single line of input.
     - `func_5()`: Splits a line of input into a list of strings.
   - However, the program does not implement the actual logic to solve the problem. It only provides input handling functions.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program is incomplete and does not contain the logic to solve the problem as described.
   - It lacks the implementation of the binary search algorithm and the logic to perform the necessary swaps.
