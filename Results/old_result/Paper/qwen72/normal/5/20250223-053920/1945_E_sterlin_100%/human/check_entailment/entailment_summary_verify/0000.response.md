### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program is incomplete and does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Reading Functions**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads a single integer from input.
   - `func_2()`: Reads a line of input and returns a map of integers.
   - `func_3()`: Reads a line of input and returns a list of integers.
   - `func_4()`: Reads a line of input as a string.
   - `func_5()`: Reads a line of input and returns a list of strings split by whitespace.

2. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The program needs to handle multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it needs to read the length of the permutation `n` and the target number `x`.
   - It needs to read the permutation `p`.
   - It should perform up to 2 swaps to ensure that the binary search will find `x`.
   - It should then perform the binary search and output the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program only contains functions to read input. It does not include any logic to handle multiple test cases, perform swaps, or execute the binary search algorithm.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are not used in any meaningful way to solve the problem.
   - The program lacks the core logic required to solve the problem, which includes:
     - Reading the number of test cases.
     - Reading the permutation and the target number for each test case.
     - Implementing the logic to perform up to 2 swaps to make the binary search work.
     - Executing the binary search.
     - Outputting the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is incomplete and does not implement the required functionality to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
