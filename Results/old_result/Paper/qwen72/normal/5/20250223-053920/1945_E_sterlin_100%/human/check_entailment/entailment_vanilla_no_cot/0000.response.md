Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement the solution to the problem described. It only defines several functions for reading input, but it does not contain any logic for solving the problem, such as performing the required swaps or implementing the binary search algorithm. To be considered correct, the program should include the following:

1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reading the permutation and the number to find.
3. Implementing the logic to determine the necessary swaps to make the binary search work correctly.
4. Performing the binary search to verify the solution.
5. Outputting the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to swap.

The current program lacks these essential parts, making it incorrect for the given problem.
