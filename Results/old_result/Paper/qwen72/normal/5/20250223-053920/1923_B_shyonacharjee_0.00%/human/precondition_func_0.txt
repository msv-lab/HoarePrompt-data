t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4; cases is a list of tuples, each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), k (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9), a (a list of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n), and x (a list of integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
