### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of an array, where beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize this sum, the array should be sorted in ascending order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array will be minimized, and the sum of these differences will be maximized when the array is sorted in ascending order.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The use of `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])` is correct because the differences are always positive, and the sum of these positive differences will be maximized when the array is sorted in ascending order.
   - The function correctly returns the calculated beauty.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the number of test cases `t` and the length of each array `n`.
   - It correctly reads the elements of each array and passes them to `func_1` to calculate the beauty.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed one by one after all test cases are processed.

4. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input is read in a single line and split into a list of strings.
   - The function correctly converts the first element to an integer `t` and then processes each test case by converting the next `n` elements to integers and passing them to `func_1`.
   - The output is correctly formatted, with each result printed on a new line.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the minimum and maximum constraints for `t` and `n` as specified.
   - The program also handles the case where all elements in the array are the same, resulting in a beauty of 0.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting it and calculating the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. The input and output handling is also correct.

**Correctness: True**
