Precondition: **No variables are passed to the function `func_2`, but it reads input from `sys.stdin` which is expected to contain a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of the array, followed by `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array. The first integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) represents the number of test cases.**
