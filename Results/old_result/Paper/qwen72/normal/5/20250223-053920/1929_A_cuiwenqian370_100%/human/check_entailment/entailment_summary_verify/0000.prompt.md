You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads a series of test cases from `sys.stdin`. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function processes each test case by applying `func_1` to the array of integers and collects the results in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result to the console. The variable `t` remains unchanged, representing the number of test cases. The variable `index` is updated to the value `1 + t * (n + 1)`, where `n` is the length of the array in the last test case. The variable `data` remains unchanged, still containing the original list of strings.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after sorting the array. However, the problem requires the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`, without taking the absolute value. This means the program will not produce the correct output for arrays where the maximum beauty is achieved by a different arrangement that does not necessarily sort the array in ascending order.

Example case where the program fails:
- Input: `n = 3`, `array = [2, 1, 3]`
- Expected Output: `2` ( achievable by the arrangement `[1, 2, 3]` or `[3, 2, 1]` )
- Actual Output: `2` (achieved by the sorted array `[1, 2, 3]`)

While the output is correct for this specific case, the program will fail for other cases where the maximum beauty is not achieved by sorting the array. For example:
- Input: `n = 4`, `array = [3, 4, 3, 3]`
- Expected Output: `1` ( achievable by the arrangement `[3, 4, 3, 3]` or `[3, 3, 4, 3]` )
- Actual Output: `3` (achieved by the sorted array `[3, 3, 3, 4]`)

The program does not handle the requirement to maximize the beauty correctly, as it assumes sorting the array will always yield the maximum beauty, which is not true in all cases.
