Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

# Annotated Program:

    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers such that 2 <= len(array) <= 100 and 1 <= array[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(array).

    #State: `array` remains a sorted list of integers, and `beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `array`.
    return beauty
    #The program returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `array`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_2`, but it reads input from `sys.stdin` which is expected to contain a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of the array, followed by `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array. The first integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) represents the number of test cases.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `t` remains the same, representing the number of test cases. The variable `index` is updated to the value `1 + t * (n + 1)`, where `n` is the length of the array in the last test case. The variable `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1` applied to each array from the test cases. The variable `data` remains unchanged, still containing the original list of strings.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains the same, representing the number of test cases. The variable `index` is updated to the value `1 + t * (n + 1)`, where `n` is the length of the array in the last test case. The variable `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1` applied to each array from the test cases. The variable `data` remains unchanged, still containing the original list of strings. Each result in the `results` list is printed to the console.
