Reasoning: 

The original assessment is accurate. The problem description requires the calculation of the maximum beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The key point here is that the beauty is calculated as the difference between consecutive elements, not the absolute difference. 

However, the function `func_1` in the provided program calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after sorting the array. This approach is incorrect because:

1. **Sorting and Absolute Differences**: Sorting the array and then calculating the sum of absolute differences will not necessarily maximize the beauty. The absolute differences will always be non-negative, which is not what the problem requires. The problem requires the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\), which can be negative.

2. **Example Cases**:
   - For the input `n = 3`, `array = [2, 1, 3]`, the expected output is `2`, which can be achieved by the arrangement `[1, 2, 3]` or `[3, 2, 1]`. The program correctly outputs `2` because the sorted array `[1, 2, 3]` happens to yield the correct result in this case.
   - For the input `n = 4`, `array = [3, 4, 3, 3]`, the expected output is `1`, which can be achieved by the arrangement `[3, 4, 3, 3]` or `[3, 3, 4, 3]`. The program incorrectly outputs `3` because it sorts the array to `[3, 3, 3, 4]` and calculates the sum of absolute differences, which is `3`.

The program fails to handle the requirement to maximize the beauty correctly, as it assumes sorting the array will always yield the maximum beauty, which is not true in all cases.

Final: **False**
