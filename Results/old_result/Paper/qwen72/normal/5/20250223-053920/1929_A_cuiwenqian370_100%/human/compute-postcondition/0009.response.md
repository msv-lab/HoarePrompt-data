Output State: **The variable `t` remains the same, representing the number of test cases. The variable `index` is updated to the value `1 + t * (n + 1)`, where `n` is the length of the array in the last test case. The variable `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1` applied to each array from the test cases. The variable `data` remains unchanged, still containing the original list of strings. Each result in the `results` list is printed to the console.**
