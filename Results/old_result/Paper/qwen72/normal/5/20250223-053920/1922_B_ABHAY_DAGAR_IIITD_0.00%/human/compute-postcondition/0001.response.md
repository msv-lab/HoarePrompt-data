The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the list `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If the list has at least one test case, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will iterate over the range of the length of `test_cases`.

For the loop to execute, the list `test_cases` must have at least one test case. The state of `results` being an empty list does not affect the loop's execution and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list**
