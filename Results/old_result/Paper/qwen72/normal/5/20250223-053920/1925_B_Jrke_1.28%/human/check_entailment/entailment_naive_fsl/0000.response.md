Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than 1. In such a case, the only way to break `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with a difficulty of 1, making the GCD 1. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario. For example, if `x = 11` and `n = 3`, the program will output 1, which is correct, but it does so by default and not by correctly identifying that 11 is a prime number and the only valid sub-problems are `[1, 1, 9]`, `[1, 2, 8]`, etc., all of which have a GCD of 1. The program should explicitly check if `x` is a prime number and handle this case appropriately.
