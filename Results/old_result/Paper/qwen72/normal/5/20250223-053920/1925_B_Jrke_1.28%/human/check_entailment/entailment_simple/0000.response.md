### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a problemset where the sum of the difficulties of all sub-problems is equal to \( x \) and there are \( n \) sub-problems.
   - The balance is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - The key observation is that the maximum balance is the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than or equal to \( k = \frac{x}{n} \).
   - If \( k = 1 \), the only possible balance is 1 because the smallest positive integer is 1.
   - For \( k > 1 \), we need to find the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than or equal to \( k \).

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( x \) and \( n \).
   - It calculates \( k = \frac{x}{n} \).
   - If \( k = 1 \), it prints 1 and continues to the next test case.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `ans` to 1 and iterates over possible divisors of \( x \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{x} \).
   - For each divisor \( i \), it checks if \( i \) is a divisor of \( x \).
   - If \( i \) is a divisor, it checks if \( i \) and \( \frac{x}{i} \) are less than or equal to \( k \) and updates `ans` to the maximum of these values.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( k = 1 \).
   - The program also correctly handles the case where \( x \) is a prime number, as the only divisors are 1 and \( x \), and \( x \) will not be less than or equal to \( k \) if \( k = 1 \).

5. **Optimization**:
   - The program iterates over possible divisors up to \( \sqrt{x} \), which is an efficient way to find all divisors of \( x \).
   - It correctly updates `ans` to the maximum divisor that is less than or equal to \( k \).

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program follows the correct logic to find the maximum balance.
   - The edge cases are handled appropriately.
   - The output matches the expected results for the given examples.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly solves the problem by finding the maximum balance (GCD) of the problemset for each test case.
