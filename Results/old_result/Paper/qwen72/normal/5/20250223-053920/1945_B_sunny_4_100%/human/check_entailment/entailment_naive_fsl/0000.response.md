Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the two installations launch fireworks at the same time. For example, if `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `m = 1`, the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is 4, not 2. The program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period and adds 2, which is incorrect. The correct approach should consider the overlap of the visibility periods of the fireworks launched by both installations.
