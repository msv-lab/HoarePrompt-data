The function `func` does not explicitly define any parameters in its signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might accept multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` where `1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18`, and the total number of test cases `t` where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. The function's output is not specified, but it is expected to return some result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (where 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18) and processes these test cases. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific nature of the result is not provided.**
