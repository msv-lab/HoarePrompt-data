Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, a, b, and m are integers such that 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18. A is int(m/a) + 1, B is int(m/b) + 1, and A + B is printed for each test case.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is read from the input and remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- For each of the `t` test cases, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are read from the input and remain integers within the range 1 to 10^18.
- `A` is calculated as `int(m/a) + 1`, and `B` is calculated as `int(m/b) + 1`.
- The sum `A + B` is printed for each test case.
- The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are reset for each test case, and the values of `A` and `B` are recalculated based on the new values of `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case.
