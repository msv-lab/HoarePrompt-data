Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input, where `1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18`. It then calculates the value `ans` as `m // a + m // b + 2` and prints this value. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are reset for each new test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. **
