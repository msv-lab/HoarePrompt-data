The only variables in the loop head are `qi` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0, and `qi` should be 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `qi` is 0**
