#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem with multiple test cases, where each test case involves a string `a` of length `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) consisting only of 0s and 1s, and the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4) is provided. The function should determine the optimal position `i` to lay a road such that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side, and the road is as close to the middle of the village as possible. The function should be called with the appropriate input parameters to handle each test case.

    #State: The loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed the optimal position `left` or `right` where the string can be split such that the number of zeros on the left side and the number of ones on the right side are as close as possible to the required counts. The variables `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `left`, `leftMove`, and `right` will be reset for each test case, and their final values will be undefined after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the length of a binary string `s`, and then reads the binary string `s`. The function calculates the optimal position `i` to split the string `s` such that the number of zeros on the left side and the number of ones on the right side are as close as possible to the required counts, ensuring at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. It prints the optimal position `i` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the variables used within the function are reset for each test case, making their final values undefined.
