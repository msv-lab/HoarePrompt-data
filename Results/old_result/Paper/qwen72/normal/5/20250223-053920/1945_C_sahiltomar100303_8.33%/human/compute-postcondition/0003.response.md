The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` (the number of test cases) and a list of strings `a` (where each string represents a test case). Each string `a` in the list has a length `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and consists only of 0s and 1s. The function returns the optimal position `i` for laying a road in each test case, such that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side, and the road is as close to the middle of the village as possible. The function will return a list of integers, where each integer corresponds to the optimal position for the respective test case.
