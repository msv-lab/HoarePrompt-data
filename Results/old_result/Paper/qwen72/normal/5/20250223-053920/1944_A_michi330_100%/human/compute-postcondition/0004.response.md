Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of islands and `k` is the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the function prints `1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function has printed the appropriate output for each case, and the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are unchanged. The function does not return any value. **
