The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2). The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. It returns a value based on the number of islands `n` and the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed `k`. The exact return value is not specified, but it is expected to provide a result relevant to the problem of managing bridges between islands, considering the constraints on the number of islands and bridges.**
