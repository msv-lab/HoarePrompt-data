Output State: **The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations. For each iteration, if `k` was greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the output was `1`. Otherwise, the output was `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are unchanged after the loop, but the loop has processed `t` test cases and printed the corresponding output for each.**
