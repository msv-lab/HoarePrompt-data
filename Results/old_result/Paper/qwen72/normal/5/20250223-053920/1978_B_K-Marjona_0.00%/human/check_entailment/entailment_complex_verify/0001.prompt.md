You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: Output State: The function `func` will have processed all the iterations of the loop. For each iteration, it will have read three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input, calculated the value of `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`, and then printed the result based on the conditions provided in the loop body. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be the last set of inputs read, and `k` will be the last calculated value. The state of the function will be unchanged except for the variables and conditions within the loop body that are used for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple sets of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input, where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. For each set, it calculates a value based on the following logic: if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a * n`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a more complex expression involving `n`, `a`, and `b`. After processing all sets, the function does not return any value, but the last set of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be the final state of these variables. The function's primary purpose is to compute and print a specific value for each set of input integers based on the given conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Choosing `k`**: The program sets `k` to `min(n, b - a)`. This is a reasonable choice because:
   - `k` should not exceed `n` because Bob can only sell up to `n` buns.
   - `k` should not exceed `b - a` because if `k` is greater than `b - a`, the modified prices would drop below the usual price `a`, which is not beneficial.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not higher than the usual price, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit is `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, the profit is calculated as follows:
     - The profit from the first `k` buns sold at modified prices is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - k + 1`. The sum of the first `k` terms of this series is given by the formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) * k // 2`.
     - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price `a` is `(n - k) * a`.
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

4. **Arithmetic Series Sum**: The formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) * k // 2` is correct for the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `b <= a` by simply printing `a * n`.
   - The program also handles the case where `k` can be 0, which is valid as per the problem statement.

6. **Output**: The program correctly prints the total profit for each test case.

Given this reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
