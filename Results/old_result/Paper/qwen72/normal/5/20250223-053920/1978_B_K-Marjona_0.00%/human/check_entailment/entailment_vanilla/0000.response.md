Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Choosing `k`**: The program sets `k` to `min(n, b - a)`. This is a reasonable choice because:
   - `k` should not exceed `n` because Bob can only sell up to `n` buns.
   - `k` should not exceed `b - a` because if `k` is greater than `b - a`, the modified prices would drop below the usual price `a`, which is not beneficial.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not higher than the usual price, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit is `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, the profit is calculated as follows:
     - The profit from the first `k` buns sold at modified prices is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - k + 1`. The sum of the first `k` terms of this series is given by the formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) * k // 2`.
     - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price `a` is `(n - k) * a`.
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

4. **Arithmetic Series Sum**: The formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) * k // 2` is correct for the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `b <= a` by simply printing `a * n`.
   - The program also handles the case where `k` can be 0, which is valid as per the problem statement.

6. **Output**: The program correctly prints the total profit for each test case.

Given this reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
