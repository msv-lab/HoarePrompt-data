Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) and a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters 'W' and 'B'. For each test case, it reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself, then checks if the first or last row is entirely one color and different from each other, or if the first and last columns are entirely one color and different from each other. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function continues processing until all test cases are handled. **
