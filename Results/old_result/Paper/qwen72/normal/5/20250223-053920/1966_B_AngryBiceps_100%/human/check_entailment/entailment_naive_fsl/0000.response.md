Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the grid can be made uniform (all squares the same color) but the conditions it checks are not met. For example, consider a 3x3 grid with the following configuration:

```
W B W
B W B
W B W
```

This grid can be made all white by selecting (1,1) and (3,3) and then (1,3) and (3,1), but the program will incorrectly output "NO" because the first and last rows are not uniform, and the first and last columns are not uniform. The program should check if it's possible to make the entire grid uniform, not just based on the first and last rows and columns.
