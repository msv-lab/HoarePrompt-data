Reasoning: The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program assumes that once a player encounters the maximum score in the array `a`, they will always stay at that position. This is a significant flaw because the rules of the game allow a player to either stay at their current position or move to the position `p_x` (where `x` is their current position). This means that the players can cycle through positions in the permutation, and the program does not account for this behavior.

The example provided in the original assessment clearly demonstrates this issue. The program incorrectly outputs "Bodya" when the correct output should be "Sasha" because Sasha ends up with a higher score (9) than Bodya (7) after the two turns.

The program's logic for determining the winner is flawed because it does not simulate the game correctly. It fails to consider the possibility of players moving through the permutation and potentially revisiting positions with lower scores. This can lead to incorrect results in many test cases.

Final: **False**
