### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` and converts them to integers.
   - It reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` and converts them to lists of integers.

2. **Initial Checks for Maximum Values:**
   - The function checks if both players are initially at the position with the maximum value in `a`. If so, it prints 'Draw' and continues to the next test case.
   - If only Bodya is at the position with the maximum value in `a`, it prints 'Bodya' and continues.
   - If only Sasha is at the position with the maximum value in `a`, it prints 'Sasha' and continues.

3. **Simulating the Game:**
   - The function simulates the game for `k` turns, keeping track of the scores and positions of both players.
   - It uses two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores for each turn.
   - It uses two boolean variables `foundb` and `founds` to track if a player has found the maximum value in `a` and should stay at that position.

4. **Calculating Cumulative Scores:**
   - The function calculates the cumulative scores for each player using the lists `preb` and `pres`.
   - It then calculates the potential final scores for each player by considering the remaining turns and the maximum value in `a`.

5. **Determining the Winner:**
   - The function compares the maximum potential final scores of both players and prints the winner or 'Draw' accordingly.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Use of `MOD` and `alpha`:**
  - The variables `MOD` and `alpha` are defined but not used in the function. This is unnecessary and can be removed for clarity.
- **Incorrect Handling of Maximum Value:**
  - The function incorrectly assumes that once a player finds the maximum value in `a`, they will stay at that position for all remaining turns. This is not always correct because the game rules state that a player can either stay or move to `p_x` on each turn.
  - The function should simulate the game more accurately by considering the actual movement and score accumulation for each turn.

### Corrected Approach:
- **Simulate Each Turn Accurately:**
  - For each turn, update the scores and positions of both players based on the rules.
  - Track the scores and positions for each turn to determine the final scores.

### Conclusion:
The function has logical errors in handling the game simulation, particularly in the assumption about staying at the maximum value position. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
