### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` and converts them to integers.
   - It reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` and converts them to lists of integers.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if both players start at the position with the maximum value in `a`. If so, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
   - If only Bodya starts at the position with the maximum value in `a`, it prints "Bodya" and continues.
   - If only Sasha starts at the position with the maximum value in `a`, it prints "Sasha" and continues.
   - These checks are correct and handle the edge cases where one or both players start at the maximum value position.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - It keeps track of the positions and scores of both players.
   - If a player reaches the position with the maximum value in `a`, they stay at that position for the remaining turns, adding the maximum value to their score each turn.
   - The simulation logic is correct. It correctly updates the positions and scores of both players based on the rules of the game.
   - The program correctly handles the case where a player reaches the maximum value position and stays there for the remaining turns.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the cumulative scores for both players after each turn.
   - It then calculates the potential final scores by adding the maximum value for the remaining turns if a player has already found the maximum value.
   - The cumulative scores are calculated correctly.
   - The potential final scores are also calculated correctly by adding the maximum value for the remaining turns.

5. **Determine the Winner:**
   - The program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, and "Draw" if the scores are equal.
   - The final comparison of scores is correct and follows the rules of the game.

### Potential Issues:
- **Redundant Variables:**
  - The variables `YES`, `NO`, and `alpha` are not used in the program and can be removed to clean up the code.
- **Efficiency:**
  - The program could be optimized to avoid unnecessary calculations, especially in the case where one player has already found the maximum value position and the game can be determined early.
  - However, the current implementation is still within the constraints and will work correctly for the given input sizes.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the rules of the game as described. The initial checks and the game simulation are implemented correctly, and the final score comparison is also correct. The program handles all edge cases and performs the necessary calculations accurately.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
