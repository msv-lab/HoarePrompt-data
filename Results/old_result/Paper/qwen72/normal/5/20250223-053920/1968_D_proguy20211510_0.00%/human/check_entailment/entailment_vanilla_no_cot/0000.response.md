Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a fundamental flaw in its logic for determining the winner of the game. The game's rules state that on each turn, a player can either stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation. However, the solution incorrectly assumes that a player will always move to the position with the maximum value in the array `a` once they find it, which is not necessarily the optimal strategy.

Here are the specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Strategy Assumption**:
   - The solution assumes that if a player reaches a position with the maximum value in `a`, they will stay there for the rest of the game. This is not always the optimal strategy. For example, if the permutation leads to a cycle with higher cumulative scores, a player might benefit from following the cycle rather than staying at a single position.

2. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The solution does not account for cycles in the permutation. If the permutation contains cycles, a player might repeatedly visit the same set of positions, and the score calculation should consider these cycles.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The score calculation logic is flawed. The solution incorrectly calculates the score by assuming that the player will stay at the maximum value position once found, which might not be the best move.

4. **Redundant Logic**:
   - The solution includes unnecessary logic for handling the maximum value in `a` and appending scores based on this assumption, which does not align with the game's rules.

A correct solution should:
- Track the positions and scores of both players over the turns.
- Detect cycles in the permutation to avoid infinite loops.
- Calculate the scores based on the optimal moves (either staying or moving) for each player.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        def simulate_game(start):
            score = 0
            position = start
            visited = {}
            for turn in range(k):
                if position in visited:
                    cycle_start = visited[position]
                    cycle_length = turn - cycle_start
                    cycle_score = score - visited_scores[cycle_start]
                    remaining_turns = k - turn
                    full_cycles = remaining_turns // cycle_length
                    score += full_cycles * cycle_score
                    turn += full_cycles * cycle_length
                visited[position] = turn
                visited_scores = score
                score += a[position - 1]
                position = p[position - 1]
            return score
        
        bodya_score = simulate_game(pb)
        sasha_score = simulate_game(ps)
        
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected solution:
- Simulates the game for each player.
- Detects cycles and calculates the score based on the optimal moves.
- Compares the final scores to determine the winner.
