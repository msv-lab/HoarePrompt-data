The function `func` processes a series of game scenarios, each defined by the number of test cases `t`, the length of the permutation `n`, the number of turns `k`, the starting positions of two players Bodya (`P_B`) and Sasha (`P_S`), a permutation `p`, and an array of integers `a`. For each test case, the function determines the winner of the game or if it ends in a draw based on the values in `a` and the movement of positions in `p` over `k` turns. The function outputs 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' for each test case, reflecting the final state of the game. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results.
