To determine if the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to evaluate the condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`.

### Initial State:
- `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\).
- `sequence` is a list of integers with a length of at most 200, where each element is in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).
- `size` is 1.
- The size of the generated sequence (len(sequence)) is returned.
- `number` is not equal to 0.

### Condition Analysis:
The condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` can be broken down as follows:
- `size` is 1.
- `size + 1` is 2.
- `1 << 2` is 4 (since `1 << 2` is equivalent to \(2^2\)).
- `(1 << 2) - 1` is 3.

So, the condition simplifies to:
- `3 <= number`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), and `number` is not equal to 0, the condition `3 <= number` is already satisfied by the initial state of `number` (since the smallest possible value of `number` is 2, and it can be 3 or greater).

### Final State:
Since the condition is already satisfied by the initial state, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers with a length of at most 200, where each element is in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), `size` is 1, and the size of the generated sequence (len(sequence)) is returned. Additionally, `number` is not equal to 0.**
