You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        m = 1
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2
            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` represents the number of cards and `k` represents the position of the card to be determined, with 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The function then performs a series of calculations to determine the final position of the card and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the output for each test case is printed to the console. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `m` are reset or redefined in each iteration, and their final state is undefined after the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes each test case by first determining the number of odd-numbered cards that can be laid down in each step. The variable `s` keeps track of the cumulative count of cards laid down so far, and `m` is the multiplier for the current step (starting from 1 and doubling each time).

1. **Odd-Numbered Cards**: The program correctly identifies the number of odd-numbered cards (`x = (n + 1) // 2`) and updates `n` to the number of remaining cards that are even (`n //= 2`).
2. **Tracking the Position**: The program checks if the current step includes the k-th card by comparing `s` and `s + x`. If the k-th card is within the current step, it breaks out of the loop.
3. **Calculating the k-th Card**: The program calculates the k-th card using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`, which correctly identifies the card based on the current step and the position within that step.

The program handles edge cases and large inputs efficiently, ensuring that it works correctly for all potential cases within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
