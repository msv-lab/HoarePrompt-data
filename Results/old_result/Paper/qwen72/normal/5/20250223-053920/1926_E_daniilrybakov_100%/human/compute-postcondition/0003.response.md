The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards, and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the position of the card to be determined. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with its own `n` and `k` values, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. The function returns the position of the card that is determined based on the given `n` and `k` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards, and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the position of the card to be determined. It processes multiple test cases, each defined by `n` and `k`, with the number of test cases `t` being a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, the function returns the determined position of the card.**
