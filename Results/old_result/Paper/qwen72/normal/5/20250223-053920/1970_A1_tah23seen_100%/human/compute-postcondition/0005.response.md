Output State: **`s` is the same non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is still the length of `s`, `ans` is still an empty string, and `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` represents the depth of the balanced parentheses sequence at position `i-1` in `s`. The final value of `d[n]` will be 0, as the sequence is balanced.**
