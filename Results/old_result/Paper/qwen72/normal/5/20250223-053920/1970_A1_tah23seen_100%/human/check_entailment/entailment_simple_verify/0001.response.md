### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input string `n` and calls `func_1(n)`. This is correct as the input is a single balanced parentheses sequence.

2. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a dictionary `d` to store the prefix balance at each position.
   - It sets `d[0] = 0` to handle the initial balance before any characters are processed.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and updates the balance in the dictionary `d`:
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   - This part is correct as it correctly calculates the prefix balance for each position.

3. **Dictionary Manipulation**:
   - The program removes the last entry from the dictionary using `d.pop(n)`. This is necessary because the balance at the end of the string (position `n`) is not needed for the sorting step.
   - It then sorts the dictionary items based on the prefix balance in ascending order and, in case of ties, by position in descending order. This is correct as it follows the problem description.

4. **Constructing the Result**:
   - The program initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result.
   - It iterates through the sorted dictionary items and appends the corresponding character from the input string `s` to `ans`.
   - The original program uses `ans += s[i]` to construct the result. However, `i` in the sorted dictionary items is the position in the input string, which is 1-based. The correct way to access the character in the string should be `ans += s[i-1]` because Python strings are 0-based indexed.
   - This is a critical error that affects the correctness of the program.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)`, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string.
   - Due to the indexing error, the output will be incorrect.

### Corrected Program:
```python
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i - 1]  # Corrected to use 0-based indexing
    return ans
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a minor but critical indexing error. After correcting the indexing, the program will correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem.

Final: **False** (due to the indexing error, but can be corrected to **True** with the fix mentioned above).
