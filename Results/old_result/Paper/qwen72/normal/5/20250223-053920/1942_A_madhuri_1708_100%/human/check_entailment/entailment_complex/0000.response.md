Reasoning:

The program attempts to solve the problem by reading input from stdin, where each line represents a test case with two integers `n` and `k`. The program then processes each test case to determine if a valid array can be constructed based on the conditions provided in the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input using `[*open(0)][1:]`, which effectively reads all lines from stdin starting from the second line (skipping the first line that contains the number of test cases). This is a valid approach for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - If `k >= 2`:
     - If `n == k`, the program prints an array of `n` elements, each equal to `k`. This is correct because if `n == k`, the array can be constructed such that all `n` cyclic shifts are sorted by making all elements equal.
     - If `n != k`, the program prints `-1`. This is incorrect because it assumes that if `n != k` and `k >= 2`, no valid array can be constructed. However, this is not always true. For example, for `n = 4` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts.
   - If `k < 2` (i.e., `k == 1`):
     - The program prints an array of `n` elements, each equal to its index (`j + 1`). This is correct because if `k == 1`, the array can be constructed such that only one cyclic shift is sorted, which is the array itself when it is strictly increasing.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results directly, which is appropriate for the problem's requirements.

However, the logic for the case where `k >= 2` and `n != k` is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that no valid array can be constructed in this case, which is not always true. A valid array can be constructed by ensuring that the array has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts, even when `n != k`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it fails to handle some valid cases where `k >= 2` and `n != k`.

Correctness: **False**
