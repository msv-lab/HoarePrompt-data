Precondition: **The function should take two parameters, n and k, where n is the length of the array and k is the number of sorted cyclic shifts required, and both are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The function should return a list of n integers, each between 1 and 10^9, that satisfies the conditions, or -1 if no such array exists.**
