Reasoning:
The program is designed to compute the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (denoted by `s1`) into the desired state (denoted by `s2`). The operations allowed are:
1. Adding a cat to a box.
2. Removing a cat from a box.
3. Moving a cat from one box to another.

The function `func_1` calculates the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) and the number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`). The minimum number of operations required is the maximum of these two values because:
- If there are more cats to add than to remove, the extra cats to add will require additional days.
- If there are more cats to remove than to add, the extra cats to remove will require additional days.
- If the number of cats to add and remove is the same, the operations can be paired (one add and one remove per day), and the total number of days will be equal to this count.

The program reads the input, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the result. The function `func_1` correctly computes the required values and returns the maximum of `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`.

The execution summary confirms that the function behaves as expected and returns the correct integer value for each test case.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
