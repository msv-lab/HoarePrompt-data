You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the encoding and decoding process as described. Specifically, the character mapping is incorrect. The function `func_1` creates a mapping from each character in the sorted set of `b` to a character that is symmetric in the range from 'a' to 'z', but it does not create the correct symmetric mapping based on the distinct characters in `b` as required by the problem description. 

For example, consider the input `b = "serofedsoc"`. The correct decoding should be `"codeforces"`, but the program will produce a different result because it maps characters based on their position in the alphabet, not their position in the sorted set of distinct characters in `b`.

The correct approach should be to create a mapping from each character in the sorted set of distinct characters in `b` to its symmetric character in the same set. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    distinct_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {distinct_chars[i]: distinct_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(distinct_chars))}
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

This corrected function will correctly decode the string as per the problem description.
