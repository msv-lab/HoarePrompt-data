Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the encoding and decoding process as described. Specifically, the character mapping is incorrect. The function `func_1` creates a mapping from each character in the sorted set of `b` to a character that is symmetric in the range from 'a' to 'z', but it does not create the correct symmetric mapping based on the distinct characters in `b` as required by the problem description. 

For example, consider the input `b = "serofedsoc"`. The correct decoding should be `"codeforces"`, but the program will produce a different result because it maps characters based on their position in the alphabet, not their position in the sorted set of distinct characters in `b`.

The correct approach should be to create a mapping from each character in the sorted set of distinct characters in `b` to its symmetric character in the same set. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    distinct_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {distinct_chars[i]: distinct_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(distinct_chars))}
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

This corrected function will correctly decode the string as per the problem description.
