### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num_test_cases`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string (`num_chars`) and the encoded string itself (`b`).

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to decode the string `b`.

3. **Character Mapping:**
   - The program creates a dictionary `char_map` to map each unique character in `b` to its symmetric character in the sorted unique characters of `b`.
   - The mapping is done by iterating over the sorted unique characters of `b` and assigning each character to a corresponding character starting from the end of the alphabet (i.e., 'z' to 'a').

4. **Decoding Process:**
   - The program initializes an empty string `s`.
   - It then iterates over each character in `b` and appends the corresponding character from `char_map` to `s`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program returns the decoded string `s`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Mapping:**
  - The mapping logic in the program is incorrect. The program maps each unique character in `b` to a character starting from the end of the alphabet, but it should map each character to its symmetric character within the sorted unique characters of `b`.
  - Specifically, the line `char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))` should be `char_map[c] = sorted_unique_chars[-(i + 1)]`, where `sorted_unique_chars` is the sorted list of unique characters in `b`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    sorted_unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {}
    for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted_unique_chars):
        char_map[c] = sorted_unique_chars[-(i + 1)]
        
    #State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in the string `b` is mapped to its symmetric character in the sorted unique characters of `b`.
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    #State: `s` is a string where each character in `b` is replaced by its corresponding value in `char_map`, and `char_map` remains unchanged.
    return s
```

### Conclusion:
- The original program is incorrect because it uses the wrong logic for mapping characters to their symmetric counterparts.
- The corrected function should use the sorted unique characters of `b` to create the symmetric mapping.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
