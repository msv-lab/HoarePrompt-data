The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `password`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password` string. If the `password` string has at least one character, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `digits` and `letters` are empty lists, but they are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, the `password` must have at least one character, and `char` should be the first character of the `password`.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length of 1 to 20 characters, `char` is the first character of `password`**
