Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` only handles two specific cases: when the length of the array `a` is 2, it outputs a fixed result of `4 1` followed by `1 2`, and for any other length, it outputs a fixed result of `13 0`. This does not account for the general case or the logic required to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing the MEX operation as described.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
1. Calculate the MEX for different subarrays.
2. Apply the operation to maximize the sum of the array.
3. Track the operations performed and ensure the number of operations does not exceed \(5 \cdot 10^5\).

The provided program does not implement any of these steps and is therefore incorrect.
