Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. It only handles the specific cases where the length of the array `c` is 2 or not 2, and it outputs a fixed result for these cases. However, the problem requires a more general solution that can handle any array of length `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 18`) and maximize the sum of the elements by performing the specified operations.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The correct output should be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
However, the provided program will output:
```
13 0
```
This is clearly incorrect, as it does not maximize the sum of the elements of the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
