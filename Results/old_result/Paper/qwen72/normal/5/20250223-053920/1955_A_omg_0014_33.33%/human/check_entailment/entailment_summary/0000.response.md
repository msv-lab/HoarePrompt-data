Reasoning:

The given program has several issues that make it incorrect for the problem described:

1. **Variable Naming and Usage**:
   - The program uses variables `a`, `b`, and `c` to represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the price of two yogurts, respectively. However, the problem description uses `n`, `a`, and `b` for these values.
   - The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which is incorrect because `c` should be `b` (the price of two yogurts), and `d` should be `b / 2` (the price of one yogurt if bought in pairs).

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation**:
   - The program checks if `a * b` is less than `a * d`. This comparison is incorrect because `a` is the number of yogurts, and `b` is the price of one yogurt. The correct comparison should be between the cost of buying `n` yogurts individually (`n * a`) and the cost of buying them in pairs (`(n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a`).
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of yogurts is odd. If `n` is odd, one yogurt will need to be bought at the regular price, and the rest can be bought in pairs.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is correct. However, the result being printed is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
