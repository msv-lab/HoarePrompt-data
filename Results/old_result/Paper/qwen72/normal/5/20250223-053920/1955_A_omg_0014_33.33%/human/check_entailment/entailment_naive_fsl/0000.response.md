Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input and logic as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Variable Names**: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are used in the program, but they should be `n`, `a`, and `b` according to the problem description.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates `d = c / 2`, which is not the correct way to determine the cost of buying two yogurts at the promotion price. It should be `b` (the promotion price for two yogurts).
3. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic to determine the minimum cost is flawed. The program should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price with the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price.

Here is a correct version of the program for reference:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost of buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price
        pairs_cost = (n // 2) * b
        # Calculate the cost of buying the remaining yogurts at the regular price
        remaining_cost = (n % 2) * a
        # Total cost is the sum of pairs cost and remaining cost
        total_cost = pairs_cost + remaining_cost
        # Compare with the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price
        regular_cost = n * a
        print(min(total_cost, regular_cost))
```

This version correctly handles the input and logic as described in the problem statement.
