Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Variable Naming and Usage**: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not correctly named according to the problem description. The problem states that the input contains `n`, `a`, and `b`, but the program uses `a`, `b`, and `c`. This is a mismatch and will lead to incorrect results.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic used to determine the minimum cost is flawed. The program calculates `d = c / 2` and then compares `a * b` with `a * d`. However, this does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. The correct approach should compare the cost of buying yogurts individually with the cost of buying them in pairs.

3. **Correct Logic**: To find the minimum cost, you should:
   - Calculate the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price.
   - Calculate the cost of buying the remaining yogurts at the regular price.
   - Sum these two costs to get the minimum total cost.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts
        pairs = n // 2
        # Calculate the number of remaining yogurts
        remaining = n % 2
        # Calculate the total cost
        total_cost = pairs * b + remaining * a
        print(total_cost)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program will correctly determine the minimum cost for each test case.
