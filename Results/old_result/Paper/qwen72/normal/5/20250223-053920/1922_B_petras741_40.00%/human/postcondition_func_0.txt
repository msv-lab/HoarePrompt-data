The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `w`. If `n` is less than 3, it prints 0. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the number of ways to choose 3 distinct indices from the list `w` such that the values at these indices are the same. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The variables `t` and `buffer` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.
