#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that a > 1 and b > 1.
def func_1(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the integer result of the absolute value of the product of a and b, divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd). Since both a and b are greater than 1, the result will be a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `a` and `b` (both greater than 1) and returns the integer result of the absolute value of their product divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd). The result is always a positive integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers, and the list is non-empty.
def func_2(numbers):
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: result is equal to the final value returned by the repeated application of func_1 on all integers in the list numbers, starting with the first integer.
    return result
    #The program returns the final value of `result` after applying `func_1` repeatedly on all integers in the list `numbers`, starting with the first integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a non-empty list of integers `numbers` and returns a single integer that is the result of repeatedly applying the function `func_1` to all integers in the list, starting with the first integer. The final state of the program is that the returned integer is the cumulative result of the `func_1` applications on the list elements.
