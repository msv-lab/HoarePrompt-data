### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires distributing coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, if it wins, the amount received back is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount bet on outcome `i`.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - The condition to satisfy is `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - For each outcome `i`, the condition `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` can be rewritten as:
     \[
     \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j < k_i \cdot x_i
     \]
   - This can be rearranged to:
     \[
     \sum_{j \neq i} x_j < (k_i - 1) \cdot x_i
     \]
   - This means that the sum of the bets on all other outcomes must be less than the bet on the winning outcome multiplied by `(k_i - 1)`.

3. **Solution Strategy:**
   - The program attempts to use the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i` to determine the bets. However, this is not the correct approach.
   - The correct approach should use the LCM of the list `k_i - 1` for all `i` to ensure that the bets are large enough to satisfy the condition for all outcomes.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula:
       \[
       \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \cdot b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
       \]
     - This is a correct implementation of the LCM calculation.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the list.
     - It starts with the first number in the list and iteratively updates the result with the LCM of the current result and the next number in the list.
     - This is also a correct implementation of finding the LCM of a list of numbers.

5. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic of the program:
     - Calculates the LCM of the list `k` (which should be `k_i - 1` instead of `k_i`).
     - Sets the bet on each outcome `i` to be the LCM divided by `k_i`.
     - Verifies that the total sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - **Issue:**
     - The program calculates the LCM of `k_i` instead of `k_i - 1`.
     - This is incorrect because the condition should be based on `k_i - 1` to ensure the bets are distributed correctly.

6. **Verification:**
   - The provided functions are correct for calculating the LCM.
   - However, the main logic is incorrect because it uses the wrong values (`k_i` instead of `k_i - 1`) to distribute the bets.
   - This means the program will not always produce a valid solution that satisfies the problem's conditions.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions are correct, but the main logic is flawed because it uses the wrong values to calculate the bets. Therefore, the program as a whole is incorrect.

Final: **False**
