Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer `N` which represents the number of test cases. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `N` times, each time reading a new integer `n` which represents the largest number on the board for that test case. This is also correct.

3. **Sum of Digits Calculation**: Inside the loop, the program iterates from 0 to `n-1` (using `range(n)`), and for each number `i`, it calls `func_1(i)` to get the sum of its digits and adds this sum to `soma`. This is incorrect because the problem states that the numbers on the board are from 1 to `n`, inclusive, not from 0 to `n-1`. The correct range should be `range(1, n + 1)`.

4. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a number by converting the number to a string, iterating over each character, converting it back to an integer, and summing these integers. This part is correct.

5. **Output**: The program prints the total sum `soma` after processing all test cases. This is incorrect because the sum should be printed for each test case individually, not as a cumulative sum for all test cases. The correct approach is to print the sum for each test case inside the loop.

6. **Efficiency**: The program's time complexity is \(O(N \cdot n)\), where `N` is the number of test cases and `n` is the largest number in each test case. Given the constraints \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), this approach is likely to exceed the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case. The corrected program addresses this by calculating the sum for each test case individually, but it still has the same time complexity, which is inefficient.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issues, we need to:
- Iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive) instead of 0 to `n-1`.
- Print the sum for each test case individually.
- Consider optimizing the sum calculation to avoid the time limit issue.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def sum_of_digits(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    soma = sum(sum_of_digits(i) for i in range(1, n + 1))
    print(soma)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Function `sum_of_digits`**: This function calculates the sum of the digits of a number.
- **Main Loop**: For each test case, the program calculates the sum of the digits for numbers from 1 to `n` and prints the result for that test case.

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning and the corrected program, the original program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
