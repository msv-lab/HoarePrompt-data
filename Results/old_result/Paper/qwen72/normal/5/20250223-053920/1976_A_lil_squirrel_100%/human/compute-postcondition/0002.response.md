The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ch` and the string `password`. For the loop to execute, the string `password` must have at least one character. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20 and `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Therefore, the state of `password` is already sufficient to ensure the loop executes. However, the variable `ch` needs to be initialized to the first character of `password` for the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `ch` is the first character of `password`, `letters` is an empty list, `digits` is an empty list**
