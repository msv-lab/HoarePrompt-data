Reasoning:  
The program is designed to verify if a password meets the criteria set by Monocarp. The criteria are:
1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. No digit should come after a letter.
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program processes each password as follows:
- It separates the characters into two lists: one for letters and one for digits.
- It checks if the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns "NO".
- It checks if the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns "NO".
- It iterates through the password to ensure no letter is immediately followed by a digit. If such a sequence is found, it returns "NO".
- If all checks pass, it returns "YES".

The program correctly implements the logic to verify the password based on the given criteria. The input and output states are also accurately described, and the function behaves as expected for the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
