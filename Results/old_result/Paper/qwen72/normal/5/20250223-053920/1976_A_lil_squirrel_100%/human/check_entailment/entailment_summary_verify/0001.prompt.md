You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a string `password` of length `n` (where 1 <= n <= 20 and `password` consists of lowercase Latin letters and digits). It returns 'NO' if the letters in `password` are not in sorted order, if the digits in `password` are not in sorted order, or if any lowercase letter is immediately followed by a digit. If none of these conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.

2. **Character Classification:**
   - The program separates the characters of the password into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - The program checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - The program checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Order of Letters and Digits:**
   - The program iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If all the conditions are satisfied, the program returns 'YES'.

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- **Condition 1:** The program assumes that the input password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, which is a valid assumption based on the problem description.
- **Condition 2:** The program ensures that all letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- **Condition 3:** The program ensures that all digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- **Condition 4:** The program ensures that no digit comes after a letter.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty Password:** The problem description guarantees that the password length `n` is at least 1, so this case is not applicable.
- **Password with Only Letters or Only Digits:** The program correctly handles these cases by not failing the sorting checks and the order check.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the required conditions for a strong password as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
