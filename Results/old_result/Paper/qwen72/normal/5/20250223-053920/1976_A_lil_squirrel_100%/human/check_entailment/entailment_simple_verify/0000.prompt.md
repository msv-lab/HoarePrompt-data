You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`, and `letters` is sorted.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`, `letters` is sorted, and `digits` is sorted.
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: The loop will either return 'NO' if there is any lowercase letter immediately followed by a digit in `password`, or it will not return anything and the state of `n`, `password`, `letters`, and `digits` will remain unchanged.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly verifies the strength of the password based on the given conditions:

1. **Password Composition**: The program checks that the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. This is implicitly handled by the logic that separates letters and digits into two lists.

2. **No Digit After a Letter**: The program checks that there is no digit that comes immediately after a letter. This is done by iterating through the password and checking if a letter is followed by a digit. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Digits Sorted in Non-decreasing Order**: The program checks that all digits in the password are sorted in non-decreasing order. This is done by comparing the `digits` list with its sorted version.

4. **Letters Sorted in Non-decreasing Order**: The program checks that all letters in the password are sorted in non-decreasing order. This is done by comparing the `letters` list with its sorted version.

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly:
- If the password contains only letters, it will check that they are sorted.
- If the password contains only digits, it will check that they are sorted.
- If the password contains both letters and digits, it will check that letters are sorted, digits are sorted, and no digit comes after a letter.

Given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and the problem description, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.
