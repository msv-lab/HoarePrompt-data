Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Character Separation**: The function `func_1` separates the characters of the password into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits. This is necessary to check the sorting conditions for letters and digits separately.

3. **Sorting Check for Letters and Digits**:
   - The program checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - These checks ensure that the letters and digits in the password are sorted as required.

4. **Ordering Check for Letters and Digits**:
   - The program iterates through the password to check if there is any digit that comes immediately after a letter. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.
   - This check ensures that no digit follows a letter, which is one of the conditions for a strong password.

5. **Final Return**:
   - If all the checks pass, the program returns 'YES', indicating that the password is strong.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles passwords that consist only of letters or only of digits correctly, as it will either find the letters or digits sorted, and the loop will not find any digit following a letter.

Given the problem description and the execution states provided, the program correctly implements all the required conditions for a strong password.

Correctness: **True**
