Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Password Composition**:
   - The function `func_1` implicitly handles the composition of the password by separating characters into `letters` and `digits` lists. If the password contains any character that is neither a lowercase Latin letter nor a digit, it will not be appended to either list, but this is not a concern because the problem guarantees valid inputs.

2. **No Digit After a Letter**:
   - The function iterates through the password and checks if any letter is immediately followed by a digit. This is done using the loop:
     ```python
     for i in range(len(password) - 1):
         if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
             return 'NO'
     ```
   - This ensures that no digit comes after a letter, which is one of the conditions for a strong password.

3. **Digits Sorted in Non-decreasing Order**:
   - The function checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version:
     ```python
     if digits != sorted(digits):
         return 'NO'
     ```
   - This ensures that all digits in the password are sorted correctly.

4. **Letters Sorted in Non-decreasing Order**:
   - The function checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version:
     ```python
     if letters != sorted(letters):
         return 'NO'
     ```
   - This ensures that all letters in the password are sorted correctly.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the password contains only letters, the `digits` list will be empty, and the function will only check the sorting of letters.
   - If the password contains only digits, the `letters` list will be empty, and the function will only check the sorting of digits.
   - If the password contains both letters and digits, the function will check both lists and the order of characters.

Given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and the problem description, the program correctly implements all the required conditions and handles all potential cases.

Final: **True**
