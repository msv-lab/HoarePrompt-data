### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Logic for Sorting**:
   - The function aims to check if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying the operation of splitting elements that are at least 10 into their digits.
   - It iterates over the array from the end to the beginning, checking if the current element is less than the previous element.
   - If it finds such a pair, it splits the previous element into its digits and appends the current element to the list of digits.
   - It then checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted. If it is not, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in the array for a test case, it prints 'YES' if the array can be sorted, otherwise 'NO'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the array is already sorted.
   - It also handles the case where the array contains elements that are less than 10, as these elements cannot be split further.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The logic for splitting the element and checking the sorted order is flawed. Specifically, the function splits the element `arr[i - 1]` and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits, but it does not correctly simulate the operation of replacing `arr[i - 1]` with its digits and then rechecking the entire array.
   - The function should instead simulate the operation of replacing the element with its digits and then recheck the entire array to ensure it is sorted.

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning above, the function is **incorrect** because it does not correctly simulate the operation of splitting elements and rechecking the entire array for sorted order. The function only checks a local condition and does not account for the global sortedness of the array after multiple operations.

### Correctness: **False**
