Output State: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is an input integer, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` representing the number of sticks and their lengths respectively, such that 1 <= t <= 100, 1 <= n <= 100, and 1 <= a_i <= 100. `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The values of `a`, `n`, `t`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet provided.
