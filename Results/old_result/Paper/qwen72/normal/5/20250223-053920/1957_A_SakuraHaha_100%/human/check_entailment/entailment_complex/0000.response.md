Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from a given set of sticks. The logic in the function `func_1` is to count the occurrences of each stick length and then determine how many groups of three identical sticks can be formed, as each regular polygon requires at least three sides of the same length.

However, the program has a logical flaw in the calculation of the number of polygons. The program assumes that each polygon requires exactly 3 sides, which is only true for triangles. For regular polygons with more sides, the number of required sticks is greater than 3. The correct approach should be to calculate the number of polygons for each possible number of sides (from 3 to 100, since the maximum stick length is 100) and sum these values.

Additionally, the function `func_1` is called without passing any arguments, which is not consistent with the problem description that requires handling multiple test cases. The function should be called within a loop that iterates over the number of test cases, and each test case should be processed independently.

Given these issues, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
