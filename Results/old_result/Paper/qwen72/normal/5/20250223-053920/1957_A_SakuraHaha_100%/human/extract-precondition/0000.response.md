Precondition: **The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` representing the number of sticks and their lengths respectively, such that 1 <= t <= 100, 1 <= n <= 100, and 1 <= a_i <= 100.**
