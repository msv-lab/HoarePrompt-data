Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the user. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` and calculates the number of groups of three identical sticks that can be formed. The result, `ans`, is printed to the console. The function does not return any value, and the state of the program after the function concludes is that `a` and `n` remain unchanged, while `ans` contains the calculated number of groups. **
