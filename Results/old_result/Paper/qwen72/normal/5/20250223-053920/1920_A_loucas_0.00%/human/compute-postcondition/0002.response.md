Output State: **For each test case, the variable `num` will hold the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big` and less than the minimum value in `less`, and is not in the list `no`. If no such integer exists, `num` will be 0. The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` will be empty after each test case. The variable `iterable` will have the value `loop - 1` after the loop completes.**
