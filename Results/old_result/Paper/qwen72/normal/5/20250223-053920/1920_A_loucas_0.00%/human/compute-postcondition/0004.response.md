Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case is defined by a set of constraints. Each constraint is a pair (a, x), where `a` indicates the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3) and `x` is an integer. The function finds and prints the smallest integer `num` for each test case that meets the following criteria: it is greater than or equal to the maximum value in the list of type 1 constraints (`big`), less than the minimum value in the list of type 2 constraints (`less`), and not present in the list of type 3 constraints (`no`). If no such integer exists, `num` is set to 0. After processing each test case, the lists `big`, `less`, and `no` are reset to empty. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. **
