Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`. The function checks if there exists at least one character position `i` (0 â‰¤ i < n) where `a[i]` or `b[i]` is different from `c[i]`. If such a position exists, it prints 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. **
