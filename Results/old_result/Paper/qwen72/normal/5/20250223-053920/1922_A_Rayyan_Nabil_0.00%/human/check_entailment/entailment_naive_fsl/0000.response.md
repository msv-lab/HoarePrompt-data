Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it does not ensure that the strings `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not. The program simply checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for each position `i`, but it does not verify that `a` and `b` match the template in the required manner.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```
For this input, the program will output "YES" because `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for all `i`. However, there is no template that can match both `a` and `b` while not matching `c`. For example, if the template is "ABC", then `a` and `b` do not match the template because they do not have uppercase letters. If the template is "abc", then `c` matches the template, which is not allowed.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
