Postcondition: ***`x` is the last digit of the last element in `a` that was processed, `y` is the first digit of the last element in `a` that was processed, `n` is the length of the list `c`, and `c` is now a sorted list constructed by appending elements from `a` or their digits based on the conditions in the loop. If `c` is equal to `d`, `b` has an additional element `1` appended to it. Otherwise, `b` has an additional element `0` appended to it, and `c` is not equal to `d`.***
