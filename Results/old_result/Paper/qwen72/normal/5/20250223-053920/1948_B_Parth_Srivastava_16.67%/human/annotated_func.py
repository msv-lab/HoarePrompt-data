#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list, where 2 <= n <= 50 and 0 <= a_i <= 99 for all elements a_i in the list.
def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
        
    #State: x is the last digit of the last element in `a` that was processed, y is the first digit of the last element in `a` that was processed, n is the length of the list `c`, and c is a list constructed by appending elements from `a` or their digits based on the conditions in the loop.
    d = sorted(c)
    if (c == d) :
        b.append(1)
    else :
        b.append(0)
    #State: *`x` is the last digit of the last element in `a` that was processed, `y` is the first digit of the last element in `a` that was processed, `n` is the length of the list `c`, and `c` is now a sorted list constructed by appending elements from `a` or their digits based on the conditions in the loop. If `c` is equal to `d`, `b` has an additional element `1` appended to it. Otherwise, `b` has an additional element `0` appended to it, and `c` is not equal to `d`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `k` and a space-separated list of integers `a` from user input. It processes the list `a` to construct a new list `c` by appending elements from `a` or their digits based on specific conditions. After processing, it sorts the list `c` and appends `1` to a global list `b` if `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it appends `0` to `b`. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the global list `b` and constructs the list `c` which is sorted.
