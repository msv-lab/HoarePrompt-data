Correctness: **False**

The given program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the problem described:

1. **Function Call Timing**: The function `func_1()` is called before the list `b` is populated, and the results of `func_1()` are not stored or used in the first loop. This means that the list `b` will be empty when the second loop tries to access its elements, leading to an `IndexError`.

2. **Handling of Digits**: The logic for splitting elements into their digits and inserting them back into the array is not fully correct. Specifically, the program only checks if the first digit (`y`) is greater than or equal to the last element in the list `c` and if the first digit is less than or equal to the second digit (`x`). This is not sufficient to ensure that the array can be sorted by the described operations.

3. **Sorting Check**: The program checks if the list `c` is equal to its sorted version `d` to determine if the array can be sorted. However, this check is not accurate because the operation described in the problem can only split elements into their digits, not rearrange them. The program should instead check if the array can be transformed into a sorted array by performing the operations, which involves more complex logic.

4. **Variable Naming and Redundancy**: The variables `x`, `y`, and `n` are used in a way that is not necessary. The variable `n` is redundant since the length of `c` can be directly used. Additionally, the logic for splitting and appending digits can be simplified.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(a):
    # Function to split an element into its digits
    def split_element(num):
        return [int(digit) for digit in str(num)]
    
    # Create a new array by splitting elements greater than or equal to 10
    new_a = []
    for num in a:
        if num >= 10:
            new_a.extend(split_element(num))
        else:
            new_a.append(num)
    
    # Check if the new array is sorted
    return new_a == sorted(new_a)

m = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(m):
    k = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    results.append('YES' if can_be_sorted(a) else 'NO')

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version:
- Defines a helper function `split_element` to split an integer into its digits.
- Creates a new array `new_a` by applying the operation to elements greater than or equal to 10.
- Checks if the new array is sorted and appends the result to the `results` list.
- Prints the results for each test case.
