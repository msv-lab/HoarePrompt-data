The function `thing` does not take any input parameters. However, based on the problem description, the function should be designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing an integer array `a` of length `n` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and each element in `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99. The function should determine if it is possible to make the array `a` sorted in non-decreasing order using the specified operation.
