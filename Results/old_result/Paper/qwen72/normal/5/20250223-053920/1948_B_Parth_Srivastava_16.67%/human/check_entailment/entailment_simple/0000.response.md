### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the results of each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()` twice, which is incorrect. It should only call `func_1()` once per test case.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   - It initializes variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and an empty list `c` to store the transformed array.
   - The function iterates over each element in the array `a` and processes it based on the following conditions:
     - If the element is greater than 10 and it is not the first element, it splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
     - It checks if the first digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` and if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If both conditions are met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` in that order.
     - If the conditions are not met, it appends the original element to `c`.
     - If the element is the first element and it is greater than 10, it splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
     - It checks if `y` is less than or equal to `x` and appends the digits or the original element to `c` accordingly.
     - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element to `c` as is.

3. **Sorting and Comparison**:
   - After processing all elements, the function sorts the list `c` and checks if the sorted list `d` is equal to the original list `c`.
   - If they are equal, it appends `1` to the list `b` (indicating a sorted array is possible).
   - If they are not equal, it appends `0` to the list `b` (indicating a sorted array is not possible).

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints 'YES' if the corresponding element in `b` is `1` and 'NO' if it is `0`.

### Issues:
- **Double Function Call**: The program calls `func_1()` twice for each test case, which is incorrect. It should call `func_1()` only once per test case.
- **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Appending**:
  - The logic for splitting and appending digits is not correct. It should always split the element into digits and append them to `c` if the element is greater than 10, regardless of the position in the array.
  - The condition `if y >= c[n - 1]` is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

### Corrected Program:
```python
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            c.append(y)
            c.append(x)
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
    
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)

for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected as described above.
- **False** if the program is left as is, because it has the issues mentioned.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
