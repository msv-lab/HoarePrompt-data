Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the transition between AM and PM for the 12-hour format. Specifically, the program incorrectly labels "12:00" as "12:00 AM" and "00:00" as "12:00 AM" when they should be "12:00 PM" and "12:00 AM" respectively. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the hour is "00" correctly, as it should be "12:00 AM" for the first half of the day.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        (h1, time) = ('', '')
        if int(h) < 12:
            time = 'AM'
            if h == '00':
                h1 = '12'
            else:
                h1 = h
        else:
            time = 'PM'
            if h == '12':
                h1 = '12'
            else:
                h1 = str(int(h) - 12)
        print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, including the special cases for "00:00" and "12:00".
