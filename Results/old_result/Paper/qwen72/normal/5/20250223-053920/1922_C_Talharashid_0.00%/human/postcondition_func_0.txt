The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of strictly increasing integers and a set of queries. For each query, it calculates and prints the minimum cumulative difference between the specified indices, considering both forward and backward traversals of the list. The function reads the number of test cases, the list of integers, and the queries from standard input. After processing all queries for all test cases, the function terminates with the input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `m` unchanged, and the dictionaries `d1` and `d2` populated with the cumulative differences for each index.
