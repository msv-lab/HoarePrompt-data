Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**: The function correctly processes multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The function calculates the modular inverse `c` of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `10^9 + 7`. This is correct because `n * (n - 1) // 2` represents the total number of possible pairs of children, and the modular inverse is used to handle the probability of selecting a friend pair.

3. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**: The function correctly sums the initial friendship values `a` for all `m` pairs of friends. This is done by iterating over the `m` pairs and adding their friendship values to `a`.

4. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**: The function calculates the cumulative sum `s` over `k` iterations. However, the expression used in the loop is incorrect. The correct expression should account for the expected increase in friendship value for each pair chosen. The current expression `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is not correct because it does not properly reflect the expected value calculation.

5. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each chosen pair should be calculated as follows:
   - For each excursion, the probability of selecting a friend pair is `m / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, which is `c * m`.
   - The expected increase in friendship value for each chosen pair is the sum of the initial friendship values `a` plus the number of excursions `k` (since each chosen pair's value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion).

6. **Correct Expression**: The correct expression for the cumulative sum `s` should be:
   - `s = s + c * a + c * m * i` for each iteration `i` from 0 to `k-1`.

7. **Final Output**: The function correctly prints the result `s % M` for each test case, where `M` is `10^9 + 7`.

Given the incorrect expression in the cumulative sum calculation, the function will not produce the correct expected value for the sum of friendship values.

Correctness: **False**
