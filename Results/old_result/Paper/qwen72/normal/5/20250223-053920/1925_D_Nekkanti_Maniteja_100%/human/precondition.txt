t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, n, m, and k are integers for each test case where 2 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), and 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5, and for each of the m pairs, a_i, b_i, and f_i are integers such that a_i â‰  b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9. The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
