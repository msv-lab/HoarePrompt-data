The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This result represents the number of test cases the function `func` is intended to handle. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the number of test cases is at least 1, and `i` is 0.

State: **`i` is 0, the number of test cases (result of `int(input())`) must be greater than 0**
