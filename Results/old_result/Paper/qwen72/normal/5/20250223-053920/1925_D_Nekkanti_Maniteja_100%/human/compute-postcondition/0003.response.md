Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `m` pairs of integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. For each test case, it calculates a cumulative sum `s` based on the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `10^9 + 7`, the number of pairs `m`, and the sum of friendship values `a`. The final result for each test case is `s % M`, where `M` is `10^9 + 7`, and this result is printed. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, and `a` are reset for each test case, and their final state is the state immediately after the last iteration of the inner `k` loop. **
