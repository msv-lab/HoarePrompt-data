The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving multiple test cases, each with the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`. The input for each test case includes `n`, `m`, and `k` as integers, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, `0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2)`, and `1 ≤ k ≤ 2 * 10^5`. Additionally, for each of the `m` pairs, there are three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing the indices of the children in the pair and their initial friendship value, with `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n`, `a_i ≠ b_i`, and `1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9`. The function should handle up to `5 * 10^4` test cases, with the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases not exceeding `10^5` and the sum of `k` not exceeding `2 * 10^5`.
