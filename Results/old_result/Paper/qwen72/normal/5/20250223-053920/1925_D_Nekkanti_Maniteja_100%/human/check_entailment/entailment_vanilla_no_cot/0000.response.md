Correctness: **False**

The given program has a logical error in the way it calculates the expected sum of friendship values. The program incorrectly accumulates the sum of friendship values over the excursions. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case.
   - It initializes `M` as \(10^9 + 7\) and `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of pairs of children, which is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

2. **Friendship Value Sum Calculation**:
   - The program correctly sums up the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends and stores it in `a`.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program uses a loop to calculate the expected sum of friendship values over `k` excursions. However, the way it updates `s` is incorrect.
   - The line `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect because it incorrectly multiplies `c` multiple times and does not properly account for the expected value of the friendship values.

The correct approach to calculate the expected sum of friendship values is as follows:

- For each excursion, the expected value of the friendship value of the chosen pair is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends divided by the total number of pairs of children, plus the expected number of times each pair of friends is chosen.
- The expected number of times a pair of friends is chosen in `k` excursions is \( \frac{k \cdot m}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
- The expected increase in the friendship value for each pair of friends over `k` excursions is \( \frac{k \cdot m}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
- Therefore, the total expected sum of friendship values over `k` excursions is \( k \cdot \left( \frac{a + k \cdot m}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \).

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a = (a + f) % M
        expected_value = (k * (a + k * m * c) % M) * c % M
        print(expected_value)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `total_pairs` is calculated as \(\binom{n}{2}\).
   - `c` is the modular inverse of `total_pairs`.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**:
   - `a` is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value for each excursion is \( \frac{a + k \cdot m \cdot c}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - The total expected value over `k` excursions is \( k \cdot \left( \frac{a + k \cdot m \cdot c}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \).
   - This is simplified to \( k \cdot (a + k \cdot m \cdot c) \cdot c \mod M \).

This corrected program should now correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all test cases.
