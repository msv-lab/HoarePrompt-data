The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and writes the results to standard output. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing periodicities. For each test case, the function calculates the smallest year that is a multiple of all the periodicities and appends it to a list of results. After processing all test cases, it writes the results to standard output, each on a new line. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly outputs the results.
