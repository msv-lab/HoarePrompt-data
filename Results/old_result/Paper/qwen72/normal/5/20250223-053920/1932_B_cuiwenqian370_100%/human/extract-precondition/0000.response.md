Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: t, an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases and `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing the periodicities of the signs for a test case.
