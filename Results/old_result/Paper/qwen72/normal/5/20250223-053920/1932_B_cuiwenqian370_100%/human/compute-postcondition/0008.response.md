Output State: **The variable `index` is updated to the value `2 + 2 * T`, the variable `results` is a list of strings, each representing the last year calculated for each test case, and the variable `T` remains the same as its initial value, which is the integer value of `data[0]`. The output is the joined string of `results` with each element separated by a newline character, followed by a newline character.**

Explanation:
- The code `sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')` writes the elements of the `results` list, separated by newline characters, to the standard output, followed by an additional newline character.
- The variables `index` and `T` are not affected by this code, so their values remain the same.
- The state of `results` is not changed by this code, but its contents are written to the output.
