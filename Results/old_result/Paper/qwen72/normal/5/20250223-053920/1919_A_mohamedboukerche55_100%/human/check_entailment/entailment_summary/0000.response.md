Reasoning:  
The program's logic is based on the parity (even or odd) of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the game is essentially about who can make the last move, and this depends on the total number of moves that can be made, which is (a + b - 2). The reason for subtracting 2 is that each player must make at least one move, and the game ends when one player cannot make a move (i.e., when their wallet is empty).

- If the total number of moves (a + b - 2) is odd, the player who starts (Alice) will make the last move and win.
- If the total number of moves (a + b - 2) is even, the second player (Bob) will make the last move and win.

However, the program simply checks if (a + b) is even or odd, which is a simplified version of the above logic. This works because:
- If (a + b) is even, then (a + b - 2) is also even.
- If (a + b) is odd, then (a + b - 2) is also odd.

Thus, the program's logic is correct in determining the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins.

However, there is a potential issue with the way the input is read and split. The program uses `list(s.split())[0]` and `list(s.split())[1]` to extract `a` and `b`. This is unnecessary and can be simplified to `a, b = map(int, input().split())`.

Despite this minor inefficiency, the program still works correctly for the given problem description and input format.

Correctness: **True**
