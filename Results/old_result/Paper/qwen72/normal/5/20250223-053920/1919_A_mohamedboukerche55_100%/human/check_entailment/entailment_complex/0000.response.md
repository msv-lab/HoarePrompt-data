### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob where they take turns removing a coin from their wallets, with the option to swap wallets. The player who cannot make a valid move loses. The key insight is that the game is essentially about the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins in both wallets combined.

Here's the logic:
- If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally.
- If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally.

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input.
3. It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
4. It prints "Bob" if the sum is even, and "Alice" if the sum is odd.

The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. It also correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description and input constraints.
