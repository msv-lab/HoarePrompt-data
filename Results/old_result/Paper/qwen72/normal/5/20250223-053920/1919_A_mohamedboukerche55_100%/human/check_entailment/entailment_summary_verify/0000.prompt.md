You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Example

Input

    1 1
    
    1 4
    
    5 3

    1000000000 1000000000

Output

    Bob
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Bob
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads a string `s` from the input, splits the string into two integers `a` and `b`, and checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'; if the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers read from the input during the `t` iterations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game for all potential cases. The logic in the program is based on the sum of the coins in both wallets being even or odd, which is not a correct approach to solving the problem.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
Alice
```

Actual Output from the program:
```
Bob
```

In this case, Alice can win by following these steps:
1. Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob. Now, a=2 and b=1.
2. Bob chooses to not swap wallets. Now, a=1 and b=1.
3. Alice chooses to not swap wallets. Now, a=0 and b=1.
4. Bob is forced to not swap wallets. Now, a=0 and b=0.
5. Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

The program incorrectly outputs "Bob" because it relies on the sum of the coins being even or odd, rather than the optimal strategy for the game. The correct approach would involve considering the parity of the number of coins in each wallet and the optimal moves that can be made.
