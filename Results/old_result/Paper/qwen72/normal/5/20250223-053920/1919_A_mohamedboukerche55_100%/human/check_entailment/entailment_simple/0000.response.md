### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads a line of input and splits it into two integers `a` and `b`, which represent the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

2. **Game Logic:**
   - The game's outcome is determined by the parity (odd or even) of the sum of the coins in both wallets.
   - If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, Bob will win. This is because if the total number of coins is even, the game will always end in a state where both wallets are empty, and Bob will be the one to make the last move.
   - If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, Alice will win. This is because if the total number of coins is odd, the game will end in a state where one wallet is empty and the other has one coin, and Alice will be the one to make the last move.

3. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints "Bob" if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and "Alice" if the sum is odd.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output as specified and determines the winner based on the correct game theory reasoning.

**Correctness: True**
