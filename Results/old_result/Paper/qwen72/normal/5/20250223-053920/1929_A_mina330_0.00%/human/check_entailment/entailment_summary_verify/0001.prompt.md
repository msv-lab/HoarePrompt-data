You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        print(kq)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `ntest` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `a` and calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements of the first half of the sorted list. This sum is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `ntest` remains the same, `n` is the last input integer read, `a` is the last list of integers read and sorted, and the sum of the differences for the last test case is printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Rearranging the elements of the array can help achieve this maximum beauty.

2. **Approach Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the elements of the array \(a\).
   - The array \(a\) is then sorted.
   - The program calculates the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, up to the middle of the array.

3. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sorting the array is a key step because it ensures that the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are maximized when the elements are paired in this manner.
   - By sorting, the smallest elements are paired with the largest elements, which maximizes the positive differences.

4. **Calculating the Beauty**:
   - The program iterates through the first half of the sorted array and calculates the differences between the corresponding largest and smallest elements.
   - This is done by summing \(a[n-i-1] - a[i]\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(\frac{n}{2} - 1\).

5. **Output**:
   - The calculated beauty is printed for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where all elements are the same (e.g., [69, 69, 69]) correctly, as the beauty will be 0.
   - It also handles the case where the array has an odd number of elements correctly, as it only iterates up to the middle of the array.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting and then summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements. The approach is sound and the implementation matches the problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
