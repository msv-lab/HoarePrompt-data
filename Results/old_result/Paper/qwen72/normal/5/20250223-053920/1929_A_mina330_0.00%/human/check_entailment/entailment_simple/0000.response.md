### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `ntest`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The program sorts the array `a` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because the problem requires maximizing the sum of differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

3. **Calculating the Beauty:**
   - The program initializes a variable `kq` to 0, which will store the maximum beauty of the array.
   - It then iterates over the first half of the sorted array and calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements for each pair. This is done by adding \((a[\text{len}(a) - i - 1] - a[i])\) to `kq` for \(i\) from 0 to \(\text{len}(a) // 2 - 1\).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated maximum beauty `kq` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Optimality of Sorting:**
  - Sorting the array ensures that the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are maximized. By pairing the largest and smallest elements, the sum of these differences is maximized.
  - For example, if the array is \([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\), the differences are \((5-1) + (4-2) = 4 + 2 = 6\).

- **Correctness of the Loop:**
  - The loop runs from 0 to \(\text{len}(a) // 2 - 1\), which is correct because it ensures that each pair of elements is considered exactly once.
  - The expression `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` correctly calculates the difference between the \(i\)-th smallest and the \(i\)-th largest element.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where all elements are the same (e.g., \([69, 69, 69]\)), which results in a beauty of 0.
  - It also handles the case where the array length is 2, which results in a single difference being calculated.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting and then calculating the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements for the first half of the sorted array. The program handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
