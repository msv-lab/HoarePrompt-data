You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` takes no parameters and reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (each between 0 and 9) from the input. It then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained, and the only effect is the output of 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This is done using `t = int(input())`. This is correct as per the problem description, which specifies that the first line of input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that iterates `t` times, using `for i in range(t)`. This is correct because it processes each test case one by one.

3. **Reading Test Case Input**: Inside the loop, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input using `(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())`. This is correct because it splits the input line into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. The problem description specifies that each test case contains three digits (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9).

4. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR". This is correct because it matches the definition of a stair.
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK". This is correct because it matches the definition of a peak.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "NONE". This is correct because it covers all other cases where the digits do not form a stair or a peak.

5. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case, either "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE", based on the conditions checked. This matches the problem description's requirements for the output.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither, and it handles the input and output as specified.
