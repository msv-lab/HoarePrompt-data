Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `t = int(input())`. This is in line with the problem description, which specifies that the first line of input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that iterates `t` times, using `for i in range(t)`. This is correct and ensures that each test case is processed individually.

3. **Reading Test Case Input**: Inside the loop, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input using `(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())`. This is correct because it splits the input line into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. The problem description specifies that each test case contains three digits (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9).

4. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR". This is correct because it matches the definition of a stair.
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK". This is correct because it matches the definition of a peak.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "NONE". This is correct because it covers all other cases where the digits do not form a stair or a peak.

5. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case, either "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE", based on the conditions checked. This matches the problem description's requirements for the output.

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function `func`. It correctly states that the function reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading three digits, and prints the appropriate output based on the conditions specified.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither, and it handles the input and output as specified.

Final: **True**
