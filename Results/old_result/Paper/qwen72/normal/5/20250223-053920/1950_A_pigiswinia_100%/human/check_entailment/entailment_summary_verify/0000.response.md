Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case. This aligns with the problem description which specifies that the first line of input contains the number of test cases.

2. **Reading Test Cases**: For each test case, the function reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from a single line of input using `map(int, input().split())`. This is appropriate as the problem states that each test case consists of three digits on a single line.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The condition `a < b < c` is used to check if the digits form a stair. This is correct and matches the problem description.
   - The condition `a < b > c` is used to check if the digits form a peak. This is also correct and matches the problem description.
   - If neither condition is satisfied, the program prints "NONE". This is the correct fallback behavior as per the problem description.

4. **Output**: The function prints the appropriate string ("STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE") for each test case. The output format matches the problem description, which requires the output to be printed for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), which should result in "NONE".
   - It also handles cases where the digits are not in strictly increasing or decreasing order, such as `4 1 7` (which should result in "NONE").

6. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function `func`. It correctly states that the function reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and prints the appropriate output based on the conditions provided.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. It handles all specified conditions and edge cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
