The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is typically used when the loop variable itself is not used within the loop body. 

Given that `t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The placeholder `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is not a state that affects the loop's execution.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution**
