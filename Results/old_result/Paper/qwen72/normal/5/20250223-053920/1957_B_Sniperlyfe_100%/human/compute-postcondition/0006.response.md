Output State: **The program returns the list `nums` where the first element is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and each subsequent element is the minimum of \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1}\) and the remaining value of `k` at the start of each iteration, with `k` being 0.**

In natural language: The program returns a list `nums` where the first element is calculated as \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) (since `k` is 0, this simplifies to 0). Each subsequent element in the list is the minimum of \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1}\) and the remaining value of `k` at the start of each iteration, which is also 0. Therefore, the list `nums` will contain all zeros.
