To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized by the `range(1, n)` function, meaning it starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.
2. **Variable `n`**: This variable is already given as an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\). For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

The other variables and objects (`k`, `nums`, etc.) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
