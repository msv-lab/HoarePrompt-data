Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9; `nums` is a list of length `n` with `nums[0]` set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and all other elements still initialized to 0; `k` is now `k - (2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1)`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `nums[0]` from it. The value of `nums[0]` is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\), so `k` is now `k - (2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1)`. The other variables and the structure of `nums` remain unchanged.
