### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and the function `func_1` to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

1. **Initialization of `ones` and `sum` arrays:**
   - The `ones` array keeps a cumulative count of the number of 1s in the array `nums`.
   - The `sum` array keeps a cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `nums` and 1. This is effectively the sum of `nums[i] - 1` for all `i`.

2. **Processing each query:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the number of 1s in the subarray `c[l:r]` using the `ones` array.
   - It also calculates the sum of the differences from 1 for the subarray `c[l:r]` using the `sum` array.
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is used to determine if the subarray is good.

3. **Understanding the condition:**
   - `onesInRange` is the number of 1s in the subarray.
   - `sumInRange` is the sum of the differences from 1 for the subarray.
   - The condition can be simplified to:
     \[
     \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \leq \text{sumInRange}
     \]
   - This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray `c[l:r]` can be distributed into a new array `b` such that:
     - The sum of elements in `b` is equal to the sum of elements in `c[l:r]`.
     - Each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in `c[l:r]`.
     - Each element in `b` is greater than 0.

4. **Evaluating the condition for subarrays with all 1s:**
   - If all elements in the subarray are 1, then `onesInRange` will be equal to the length of the subarray, `r - l + 1`.
   - The sum of the differences from 1 for the subarray will be 0, i.e., `sumInRange = 0`.
   - The condition becomes:
     \[
     \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \leq 0
     \]
   - Since `onesInRange` is equal to `r - l + 1`, the condition simplifies to:
     \[
     2 * (r - l + 1) \leq 0
     \]
   - This is always false, so the program will correctly output `NO` for subarrays with all 1s.

5. **Evaluating the condition for subarrays with at least one element not equal to 1:**
   - If there is at least one element in the subarray that is not 1, then `sumInRange` will be positive.
   - The condition `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) \leq sumInRange` ensures that the sum of the subarray can be distributed into a new array `b` where each element is different from the corresponding element in `c[l:r]` and greater than 0.

6. **Special case for single-element subarrays:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `l == r` by printing `NO` because a single-element subarray cannot be good (it cannot satisfy `a_i != b_i`).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate**. The program's logic is correct and handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` correctly ensures that the subarray can be transformed into a good array `b`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
