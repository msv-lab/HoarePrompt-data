Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.
   - Within `func_1()`, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `nums` of length `n`.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - The program initializes two arrays, `ones` and `sum`, both of length `n + 1`.
   - `ones` is used to store the cumulative count of elements in `nums` that are equal to 1.
   - `sum` is used to store the cumulative sum of `nums[i] - 1` for each element in `nums`.

3. **Cumulative Arrays**:
   - The program correctly updates the `ones` array to keep track of the cumulative count of 1s.
   - The `sum` array is correctly updated to store the cumulative sum of `nums[i] - 1`.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - If `l == r`, it prints 'NO' because a single-element subarray cannot be good (it cannot be replaced by a different positive integer).
   - For other queries, it calculates:
     - `onesInRange`: the number of 1s in the subarray `c[l-1]` to `c[r-1]`.
     - `sumInRange`: the sum of `nums[i] - 1` for the subarray `c[l-1]` to `c[r-1]`.

5. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if the subarray is good using the condition:
     \[
     2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}
     \]
   - Simplifying the left side of the inequality:
     \[
     2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} = \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1)
     \]
   - This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray `nums[l-1]` to `nums[r-1]` can be matched by a different array `b` where each element is positive and different from the corresponding element in `nums`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' if the condition is satisfied, otherwise 'NO'.

**Validation of the Condition**:
- The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` simplifies to `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`.
- This condition is derived from the requirement that the sum of the subarray `nums[l-1]` to `nums[r-1]` can be matched by a different array `b` where each element is positive and different from the corresponding element in `nums`.
- For a subarray to be good, the sum of the subarray `nums[l-1]` to `nums[r-1]` must be equal to the sum of the subarray `b[l-1]` to `b[r-1]`, and each element in `b` must be positive and different from the corresponding element in `nums`.
- The sum of the subarray `nums[l-1]` to `nums[r-1]` is `sum[r] - sum[l-1] + (r - l + 1)`.
- The sum of the subarray `b[l-1]` to `b[r-1]` can be at least `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` because each 1 in `nums` can be replaced by a 2 (the smallest positive integer different from 1), and each non-1 element can be replaced by a 1.
- Therefore, the condition `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange` ensures that the sum of the subarray `b` can match the sum of the subarray `nums` while satisfying the conditions that each element in `b` is positive and different from the corresponding element in `nums`.

**Conclusion**:
- The program correctly handles the input, preprocesses the data, and answers the queries based on the given conditions.
- The condition used in the program is mathematically sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Final: **True**
