Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` and `q` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is the number of test cases, `c` is a list of positive integers, `queries` is a list of tuples, `ones` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.**

The code initializes the variable `ones` as a list containing `n + 1` zeros. All other variables (`nums`, `n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, `queries`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values.
