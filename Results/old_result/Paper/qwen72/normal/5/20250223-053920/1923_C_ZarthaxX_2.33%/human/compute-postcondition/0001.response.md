The code snippet `nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `nums`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` and `q` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is the number of test cases, `c` is a list of positive integers, and `queries` is a list of tuples.**
