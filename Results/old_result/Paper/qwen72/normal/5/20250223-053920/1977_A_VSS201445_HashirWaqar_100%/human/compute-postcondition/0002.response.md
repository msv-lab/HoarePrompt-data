The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing two integers `n` and `m` where 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function should process each test case and return a result based on the values of `n` and `m`.

However, the provided function signature does not explicitly list the parameters. Assuming the function is designed to take the number of test cases `t` and the test cases themselves as input, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 100) and a list of test cases, where each test case is a pair of integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `m`.**
