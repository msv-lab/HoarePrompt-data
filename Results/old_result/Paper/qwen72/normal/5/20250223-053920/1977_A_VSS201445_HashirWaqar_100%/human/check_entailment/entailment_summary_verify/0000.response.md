Reasoning:

The original assessment is incorrect. Let's break down the logic of the program and the problem requirements to understand why.

### Problem Requirements
- Nikita can either add or remove one cube per move.
- After `n` moves, the tower must have exactly `m` cubes.
- The number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` are both between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- The output should be "Yes" if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, and "No" otherwise.

### Program Logic
The function `func` processes each test case as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
3. It checks two conditions:
   - `n >= m`: This ensures that Nikita has enough moves to potentially add up to `m` cubes.
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even. This is necessary because each move either adds or removes one cube, and the total number of moves must be even to end up with exactly `m` cubes (since each addition and removal pair cancels out).

### Analysis
- **Case 1: `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`**
  - This is the correct condition for the program to output "Yes". If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference is even, Nikita can indeed build a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
  
- **Case 2: `n < m`**
  - The program correctly outputs "No" in this case. If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to build a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves because Nikita does not have enough moves to add the required number of cubes.

- **Special Case: `n = 1` and `m = 1`**
  - The program will output "YES" because `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` (1 - 1 = 0, which is even). This is the correct output because Nikita can indeed build a tower with 1 cube in 1 move by adding one cube.

### Example Verification
- **Input:**
  ```
  3
  3 3
  2 4
  5 3
  ```
- **Output:**
  - For `3 3`: `n = 3`, `m = 3`. `n >= m` and `(3 - 3) % 2 == 0` (0 is even). Output: "YES".
  - For `2 4`: `n = 2`, `m = 4`. `n < m`. Output: "NO".
  - For `5 3`: `n = 5`, `m = 3`. `n >= m` and `(5 - 3) % 2 == 0` (2 is even). Output: "YES".

All outputs are correct according to the problem requirements.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles all cases, including the special case where `n = 1` and `m = 1`. Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect.

Final: **True**
