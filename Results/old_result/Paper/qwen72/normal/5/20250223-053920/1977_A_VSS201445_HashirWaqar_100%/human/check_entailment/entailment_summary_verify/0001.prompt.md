You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `m`, where both are between 1 and 100 inclusive. The function reads the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 100) and then, for each test case, it prints 'YES' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the values of `n` and `m` for each test case are discarded.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube from the top of the tower in each move.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If \( n \) is less than \( m \), it is impossible to have \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves because Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move.
   - If \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( m \), we need to check if the difference \( n - m \) is even. This is because:
     - Adding a cube and removing a cube (or vice versa) in two consecutive moves results in no net change to the number of cubes.
     - Therefore, to end up with exactly \( m \) cubes, the number of extra moves (i.e., \( n - m \)) must be even, allowing Nikita to balance out the extra moves by adding and removing cubes in pairs.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It checks if \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( m \) and if the difference \( n - m \) is even.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Verification of Conditions:**
   - The condition \( n \ge m \) ensures that there are enough moves to potentially reach \( m \) cubes.
   - The condition \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \) ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even, allowing for the possibility of balancing out the extra moves.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \( n \) is exactly \( m \) (which is a valid scenario and should return "YES").
   - It also handles the case where \( n \) is less than \( m \) (which should return "NO").

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves. It checks both necessary conditions and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
