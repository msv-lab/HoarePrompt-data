Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining whether, after `n` moves, it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower. Each move can either add or remove one cube from the tower. The key observation is that the number of cubes in the tower can only change by an even number of moves (since each add and remove operation cancels out in pairs).

1. **Initial Check**: The function first checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. This is necessary because it's impossible to have more cubes in the tower than the number of moves if `n < m`.

2. **Even Difference Check**: The function then checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This is because the only way to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves is if the number of "net" moves (the difference between the number of cubes added and the number of cubes removed) is even. This ensures that the operations can be balanced to achieve the desired number of cubes.

3. **Output**: If both conditions are met, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The provided execution summary confirms that the function processes the input correctly and follows the logic described above.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program is correct.
