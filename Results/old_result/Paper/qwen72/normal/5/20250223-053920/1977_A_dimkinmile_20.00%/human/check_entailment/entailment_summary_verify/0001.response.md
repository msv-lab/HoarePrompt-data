### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube from the top of the tower in one move.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to have exactly \( m \) cubes in the tower after \( n \) moves.
   - The key observation is that after \( n \) moves, the number of cubes in the tower can be any integer from 0 to \( n \) (inclusive) if \( n \) is even, and from 1 to \( n \) (inclusive) if \( n \) is odd. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and starting from 0, the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of cubes will match the parity of the number of moves.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \).
   - The program checks if \( n \ge m \). If true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

3. **Identifying the Flaw:**
   - The program's logic is incorrect because it only checks if \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( m \). This is not sufficient to determine if it is possible to have exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.
   - The correct condition should be that \( m \) must be within the range of possible cube counts after \( n \) moves, which is from 0 to \( n \) if \( n \) is even, and from 1 to \( n \) if \( n \) is odd. This can be simplified to checking if \( m \le n \) and \( (n - m) \) is even.
   - The program fails to consider the parity of \( n \) and \( m \). For example, if \( n = 2 \) and \( m = 4 \), the program incorrectly prints "No" because it only checks \( n \ge m \), but the correct answer should be "No" because \( (n - m) \) is not even.

4. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func_1` reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the user input and checks if \( n \ge m \).
   - If \( n \ge m \), it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".
   - The function does not handle the parity condition, which is crucial for the correct solution.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not consider the parity of the number of moves and the number of cubes. It only checks if \( n \ge m \), which is not sufficient to determine the correctness of the solution.

### Correctness:
Final: **False**
