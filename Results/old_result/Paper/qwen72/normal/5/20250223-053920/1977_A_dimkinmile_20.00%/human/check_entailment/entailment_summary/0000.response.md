Reasoning:  
The program provided is incorrect. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed because it only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The correct condition to check is whether the difference between `n` and `m` is even, because each move can either add or remove a cube, and the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of moves must match the parity of the number of cubes to be added or removed.

For example:
- If `n = 3` and `m = 3`, it is possible because Nikita can add 1 cube three times.
- If `n = 2` and `m = 4`, it is not possible because Nikita can only end up with 0 or 2 cubes after 2 moves.
- If `n = 5` and `m = 3`, it is possible because Nikita can add 1 cube 4 times and remove 1 cube once.

The correct condition should be:
- If `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, then it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Otherwise, it is not possible.

Given this, the program's logic is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
