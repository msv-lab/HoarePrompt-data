#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle input through a predefined mechanism (such as reading from standard input) and output through another (such as writing to standard output). The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each containing two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 26).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = ''
        
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)
        
    #State: The loop has processed all t test cases, and for each test case, it has printed a string `s` composed of the first k lowercase English letters. If k is 1, the string is repeated n times. If k is greater than 1, the string is printed twice unless n is 1, in which case it is printed once. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are no longer in use, and the loop has completed its execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from standard input. It then generates a string `s` composed of the first `k` lowercase English letters. If `k` is 1, the function prints the string `s` repeated `n` times. If `k` is greater than 1, the function prints the string `s` twice unless `n` is 1, in which case it prints `s` once. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution, and the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are no longer in use.
