Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to handle input through a predefined mechanism (such as reading from standard input) and output through another (such as writing to standard output). The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each containing two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 26).**
