### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the given operation.
   - The operation involves choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - `func_2` attempts to apply the operation to make all elements zero.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to \( n-2 \).
   - For each index \( i \), it checks if \( a_i > 1 \), \( a_{i-1} > 0 \), and \( a_{i+1} > 0 \).
   - If these conditions are met, it applies the operation by decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, scaled by the value of \( a_{i-1} \).
   - If at any point \( a_{i-1} \) is non-zero after the operation, it prints 'no' and returns immediately.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach in `func_2` is to try to reduce the middle elements while ensuring the boundary elements are not left non-zero.
   - However, the scaling by \( a_{i-1} \) in the operation is incorrect. The operation should only decrement by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, not by the value of \( a_{i-1} \).
   - The correct operation should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```
   - The current implementation can lead to incorrect results because it may decrement elements by more than the allowed amount, potentially making elements negative or skipping necessary operations.

5. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`, the correct sequence of operations is:
     - Apply operation at \( i=4 \): `[1, 3, 4, 3, 1]`
     - Apply operation at \( i=3 \): `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`
     - Apply operation at \( i=2 \): `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`
     - Apply operation at \( i=4 \): `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - The current implementation would not correctly handle this sequence due to the incorrect scaling.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because the operation in `func_2` is scaled incorrectly, leading to potential negative values and incorrect results. The correct operation should decrement the elements by 1, 2, and 1 respectively without scaling.

**Correctness: **False****
