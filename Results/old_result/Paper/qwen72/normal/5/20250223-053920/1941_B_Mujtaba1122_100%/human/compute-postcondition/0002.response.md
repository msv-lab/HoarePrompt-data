Postcondition: **The list will be modified such that all elements from index 1 to index \(n-2\) will be zero, and the first element (`list[0]`) and the last element (`list[n-1]`) will remain unchanged. The function `func_1(list, n)` has returned `True`, indicating that the condition inside `func_1` has been met.**
