Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a binary string `s` and returns the total cost calculated based on the number of '0's in `s` that appear after at least one '1'. Each '0' contributes a cost equal to the number of '1's seen before it plus one. The input string `s` remains unchanged. **
