To determine what will be printed by the `print(arr, prefix)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the values of the variables involved:

1. **`arr`**: This is a list of integers. The exact values of the elements in `arr` are not specified, so we will represent it as `[a1, a2, a3, ..., an]`, where `a1, a2, a3, ..., an` are the elements of the list.

2. **`prefix`**: This list will contain the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`, starting with 0. The length of `prefix` will be `n + 1`, where `n` is the length of `arr`. The cumulative XOR is calculated as follows:
   - `prefix[0]` is 0.
   - `prefix[1]` is `arr[0]` (since `0 ^ arr[0] = arr[0]`).
   - `prefix[2]` is `arr[0] ^ arr[1]`.
   - `prefix[3]` is `arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ arr[2]`.
   - And so on, until `prefix[n]` which is `arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[n-1]`.

Given this information, the `prefix` list will be:
- `[0, arr[0], arr[0] ^ arr[1], arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ arr[2], ..., arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[n-1]]`.

Now, let's put this together in the format requested:

Output: **[a1, a2, a3, ..., an], [0, a1, a1 ^ a2, a1 ^ a2 ^ a3, ..., a1 ^ a2 ^ ... ^ an] (where `a1, a2, a3, ..., an` are the elements of the list `arr`)**
