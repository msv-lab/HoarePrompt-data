To determine what will be printed by the `print(suf)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the structure of the `suf` list:

### Initial State:
1. **`prefix` list**: This list contains the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`, starting with 0. The length of `prefix` is `n + 1`.
2. **`suf` list**: This list contains the count of 1s and 0s at each bit position (from 0 to 31) for the elements in the `prefix` list, excluding the first element (which is 0). Each sublist in `suf` will have the format `[count_of_0s, count_of_1s]` for the corresponding bit position.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`prefix` list construction**:
   - The `prefix` list is constructed by taking the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` and starting with 0.
   - For example, if `arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`, the `prefix` list would be `[0, 3, 2, 6, 7, 2]`.

2. **`suf` list construction**:
   - The `suf` list is constructed by counting the number of 1s and 0s at each bit position (from 0 to 31) for the elements in the `prefix` list, excluding the first element (0).
   - For each bit position `i` (0 to 31), we count the number of elements in `prefix[1:]` that have a 1 at bit position `i` and the number of elements that have a 0 at bit position `i`.

3. **Example Calculation**:
   - Let's assume `arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`, so `prefix = [0, 3, 2, 6, 7, 2]`.
   - We will count the 1s and 0s at each bit position for `prefix[1:] = [3, 2, 6, 7, 2]`.

   - Bit position 0 (least significant bit):
     - Elements: [3, 2, 6, 7, 2]
     - 1s: 3 (3, 7)
     - 0s: 2 (2, 6, 2)
     - `suf[0] = [2, 3]`

   - Bit position 1:
     - Elements: [3, 2, 6, 7, 2]
     - 1s: 2 (3, 6, 7)
     - 0s: 3 (2, 2)
     - `suf[1] = [3, 2]`

   - Bit position 2:
     - Elements: [3, 2, 6, 7, 2]
     - 1s: 1 (6, 7)
     - 0s: 4 (3, 2, 2)
     - `suf[2] = [4, 1]`

   - Bit position 3:
     - Elements: [3, 2, 6, 7, 2]
     - 1s: 1 (7)
     - 0s: 4 (3, 2, 6, 2)
     - `suf[3] = [4, 1]`

   - Bit positions 4 to 31:
     - Since all elements in `prefix[1:]` are less than 8, all higher bit positions (4 to 31) will have 0s.
     - `suf[4] = [5, 0]`, `suf[5] = [5, 0]`, ..., `suf[31] = [5, 0]`

### Final Output:
The `suf` list will contain the count of 1s and 0s at each bit position (from 0 to 31) for the elements in the `prefix` list, excluding the first element (0).

Output: **[[2, 3], [3, 2], [4, 1], [4, 1], [5, 0], [5, 0], ..., [5, 0]] (where the list contains 32 sublists, each representing the count of 0s and 1s at the corresponding bit position for the elements in the `prefix` list, excluding the first element)**
