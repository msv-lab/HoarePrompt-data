Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for constructing the template and verifying the matches has a flaw. Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

In this case, the strings `a` and `b` are completely different, and the string `c` is also different from both. The program constructs a template where each character in `a` is converted to uppercase, resulting in the template `["A", "B", "C"]`. However, this template does not correctly handle the requirement that `a` and `b` must match the template while `c` does not. The program incorrectly checks the template for `c` using the same logic as for `a` and `b`, leading to an incorrect conclusion.

A correct template for this case would be `["A", "B", "C"]`, where `a` and `b` match because all their characters are different from the lowercase versions of the template characters, and `c` does not match because all its characters are different from the template characters. The program should correctly identify this as a valid case.
