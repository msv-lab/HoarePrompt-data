You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

    #State: The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations, and the final state is that `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer representing the length of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The variables `template`, `match_a_b`, and `match_c` are not retained after each iteration, so they do not have a final state outside the loop. The loop prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from the user to process `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function checks if the strings `a` and `b` can be transformed into a common template string, where characters that differ between `a` and `b` are marked as uppercase in the template. It then checks if the string `c` matches this template, with the condition that any lowercase character in the template must match the corresponding character in `c`, and any uppercase character in the template must not match the corresponding character in `c`. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for constructing the template and verifying the matches has a flaw. Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

In this case, the strings `a` and `b` are completely different, and the string `c` is also different from both. The program constructs a template where each character in `a` is converted to uppercase, resulting in the template `["A", "B", "C"]`. However, this template does not correctly handle the requirement that `a` and `b` must match the template while `c` does not. The program incorrectly checks the template for `c` using the same logic as for `a` and `b`, leading to an incorrect conclusion.

A correct template for this case would be `["A", "B", "C"]`, where `a` and `b` match because all their characters are different from the lowercase versions of the template characters, and `c` does not match because all its characters are different from the template characters. The program should correctly identify this as a valid case.
