The function `func_1` is expected to take four parameters: `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. `n` is an integer representing the length of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
