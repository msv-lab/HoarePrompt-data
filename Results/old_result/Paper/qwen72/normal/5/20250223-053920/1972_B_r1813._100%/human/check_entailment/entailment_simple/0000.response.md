### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common approach when dealing with multiple test cases and is generally correct.
   - The first element of the list `data` is the number of test cases `t`, which is correctly converted to an integer.
   - The program then iterates over the test cases, correctly extracting `n` (the number of coins) and `s` (the string representing the initial state of the coins) for each test case.

2. **Game Logic**:
   - The key to determining the winner is the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`).
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always win if both players play optimally. This is because Alice can always make the first move, and each move will change the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Since the game ends when there are no facing-up coins left, and the parity of the number of facing-up coins alternates with each move, an odd number of facing-up coins will always leave an even number for Bob, and vice versa.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will win because he will be the one to make the last move when the number of facing-up coins becomes zero.

3. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints "YES" if the number of facing-up coins is odd and "NO" if it is even.
   - The output format matches the problem description, and the program handles multiple test cases correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins. It handles input and output as specified in the problem description and follows the correct game rules.

**Correctness: **True****
