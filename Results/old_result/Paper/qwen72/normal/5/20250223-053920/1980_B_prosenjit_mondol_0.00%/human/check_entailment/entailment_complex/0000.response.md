### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k` and the list `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Index Adjustment**:
   - The function adjusts `f` and `k` by subtracting 1 to convert them to 0-based indices, which is necessary for Python list indexing.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The list `a` is sorted in non-increasing order using `a.sort(reverse=True)`. This is correct according to the problem statement.

4. **Comparison**:
   - The function compares the value of the favorite cube `x` (which is `a[f]` before sorting) with the value of the `k`-th cube in the sorted list.
   - If `a[k] > x`, the favorite cube is not among the first `k` cubes, so it will not be removed. The function prints 'NO'.
   - If `a[k] < x`, the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes, so it will be removed. The function prints 'YES'.
   - If `a[k] == x`, the function needs to determine if the favorite cube could be in the first `k` cubes or not. It checks:
     - If `k == n - 1`, this means `k` is the last index, and the favorite cube is definitely removed. The function prints 'YES'.
     - If `a[k - 1] < x`, this means the favorite cube is the last occurrence of `x` in the first `k` cubes, so it will be removed. The function prints 'YES'.
     - Otherwise, the favorite cube could be in the first `k` cubes or not, depending on the order of equal elements. The function prints 'MAYBE'.

5. **Final State**:
   - The final state of the variables `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` will be the values from the last test case after the loop completes all `t` iterations.
   - The variable `t` will be 0, as the loop has completed all its iterations.

### Correctness:
The function correctly implements the logic to determine whether the favorite cube will be removed, not removed, or may be removed based on the problem description. The conditions and comparisons are logically sound and cover all possible scenarios.

**Correctness: True**
