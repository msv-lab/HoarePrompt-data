Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the condition where it checks if the favorite cube is removed. Specifically, the condition `print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')` is incorrect. The program should check if the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes after sorting, but the current logic incorrectly assumes that if `a[k]` is equal to `x`, the favorite cube will always be removed, which is not necessarily true.

Counterexample:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 2 2
  4 3 3 2 3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  MAYBE
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

In this example, the favorite cube (index 2) shows the value 3. After sorting the array in non-increasing order, the array could be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]` or `[4, 3, 3, 2, 3]`. In the first case, the favorite cube is removed, but in the second case, it is not. Therefore, the correct output should be "MAYBE", but the program incorrectly outputs "YES".
