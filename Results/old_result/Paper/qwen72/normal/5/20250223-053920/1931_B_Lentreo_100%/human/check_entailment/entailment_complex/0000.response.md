### Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation and Initial Checks**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with `nums` as the argument.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function first calculates the total amount of water in all containers using `sum(nums)`.
   - It checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers `n`. If not, it returns 'NO'. However, the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is always divisible by `n`, so this check is redundant.
   - It calculates the mean amount of water each container should have, which is `total // n`.
   - It initializes a variable `curr` to 0, which will be used to track the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in the containers and the mean amount.
   - It iterates through each container and updates `curr` by adding the difference between the current amount of water in the container and the mean amount.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that the current container cannot be filled to the mean amount with the available water from the previous containers, so the function returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it means that the water can be redistributed to make all containers have the same amount of water, so the function returns 'YES'.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly checks if the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, but this check is unnecessary because the problem guarantees it.
   - The algorithm correctly calculates the mean amount of water each container should have.
   - The algorithm correctly tracks the cumulative difference in water amounts. If `curr` becomes negative at any point, it means that the water cannot be redistributed to make all containers equal, which is a valid condition to return 'NO'.
   - If `curr` remains non-negative throughout the loop, it means that the water can be redistributed, and the function returns 'YES'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly. In this case, there is only one container, and it is trivially possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.
   - The program also handles the case where the water amounts are already equal, which is correctly identified as 'YES'.

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
