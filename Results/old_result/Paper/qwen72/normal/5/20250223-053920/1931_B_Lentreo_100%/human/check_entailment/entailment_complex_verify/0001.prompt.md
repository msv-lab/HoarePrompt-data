You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in the containers, where the length of nums (n) is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element a_i in nums is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of all elements in nums is divisible by n.
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if (total % n != 0) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `nums` is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in the containers, where the length of `nums` (n) is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element `a_i` in `nums` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of all elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`. `n` is the length of `nums`. `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`. `total % n` is equal to 0.
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: `curr` is 0.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` representing the amounts of water in containers. It checks if it is possible to redistribute the water so that all containers have the same amount of water. If the total amount of water is not divisible by the number of containers or if during the redistribution process any container would need more water than is available to reach the average, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given `n` containers with water, and the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we read the number of containers `n` and the initial amounts of water in each container.
   - We need to output "YES" if it is possible to equalize the water, otherwise "NO".

3. **Key Insight**:
   - Since the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water in each container is `mean = total // n`.
   - The operation allows us to pour water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index.
   - To achieve the target, we need to ensure that the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the mean does not go negative at any point. If it does, it means we cannot redistribute the water to achieve the target.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the initial amounts of water in each container.
   - It calls `func_1` with the list of water amounts.
   - `func_1` calculates the total amount of water and the mean.
   - It then iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a cumulative difference `curr`.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it returns "NO".
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it returns "YES".

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly calculates the mean and checks if the cumulative difference goes negative.
   - The logic ensures that if the cumulative difference is non-negative throughout the iteration, it is possible to redistribute the water to achieve the target amount in each container.
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n = 1` (a single container).
   - It also handles cases where the water amounts are already equal.
   - The program ensures that the sum of water amounts is divisible by `n` before proceeding, which is a given condition in the problem.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
