Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a logical flaw in the function `func_1`. The function checks if the cumulative difference `curr` becomes negative at any point during the iteration. This check is intended to determine if at any step, the amount of water needed to balance the containers would exceed the available water, which would make it impossible to achieve the desired equal distribution.

However, the original assessment provides a valid counterexample where the function incorrectly returns 'NO'. Let's analyze the provided test case in detail:

```
Input:
1
3
1 5 3
```

- `nums = [1, 5, 3]`
- `n = 3`
- `total = 1 + 5 + 3 = 9`
- `mean = total // n = 9 // 3 = 3`

The function iterates through the list `nums` and updates `curr` as follows:
- First iteration: `curr += 1 - 3 = -2` (negative, so it returns 'NO')

This is indeed a logical flaw because the function prematurely concludes that it is impossible to balance the containers without considering the possibility of future operations that could correct the imbalance.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should ensure that the cumulative difference `curr` never becomes negative, but it should also consider the overall feasibility of the redistribution. The correct approach is to check if the sum of the differences (i.e., the total amount of water that needs to be moved) is non-negative throughout the process.

A corrected version of the function would be:

```python
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if total % n != 0:
        return 'NO'
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

However, the original function's logic is flawed because it does not account for the possibility of future operations that could balance the containers. The correct logic should be to check if the total amount of water that needs to be moved is non-negative at each step, and if the final cumulative difference is zero.

Given the original function's logic, it will incorrectly return 'NO' for valid cases like the one provided in the assessment. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw.

Final: **False**
