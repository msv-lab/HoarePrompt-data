The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Given the initial state, `n` is already a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), so `n` is already in a state that ensures the loop can execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The initial state already satisfies the conditions for the loop to run.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in the containers, where the length of `nums` (n) is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element `a_i` in `nums` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of all elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`. `n` is the length of `nums`. `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`. `total % n` is equal to 0. `mean` is equal to `total // n`. `curr` is 0, `i` is 0**
