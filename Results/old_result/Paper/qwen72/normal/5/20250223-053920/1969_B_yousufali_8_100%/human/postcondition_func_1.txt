The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases, where `t` is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. The function calls `func_1` `t` times. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and the state of the program is such that `func_1` has been executed `t` times. The function does not return any value.
