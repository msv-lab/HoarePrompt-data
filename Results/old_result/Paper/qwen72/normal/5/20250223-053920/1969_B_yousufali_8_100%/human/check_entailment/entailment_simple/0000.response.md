### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to find the minimum total cost to make a binary string `s` sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring `s_l s_{l+1} ... s_r` is `r - l + 1`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided solution uses a simple approach to calculate the cost.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and keeps track of the number of '1's encountered (`n`).
   - For each '0' encountered, if there are any '1's before it, it adds `n + 1` to the total cost (`ans`).

3. **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` reads a binary string `s` and initializes `n` and `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates through the string, incrementing `n` for each '1' and adding `n + 1` to `ans` for each '0' if `n` is not zero.
   - The logic is based on the idea that each '0' that is preceded by '1's requires a cyclic shift to move the '1's to the left of the '0'.
   - The cost for each such shift is `n + 1` because the substring length is `n + 1` (the '0' and all preceding '1's).

4. **Correctness of `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - This ensures that the solution is applied to each test case independently.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string `s` is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the function correctly outputs 0.
   - If the string `s` contains no '0's (e.g., "1111"), the function correctly outputs 0.
   - If the string `s` contains no '1's (e.g., "0000"), the function correctly outputs 0.
   - If the string `s` is a mix of '0's and '1's, the function correctly calculates the minimum cost by considering each '0' that is preceded by '1's.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For "10", the function correctly outputs 2.
   - For "0000", the function correctly outputs 0.
   - For "11000", the function correctly outputs 9.
   - For "101011", the function correctly outputs 5.
   - For "01101001", the function correctly outputs 11.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work as expected and handle the given constraints and edge cases.

**Correctness: True**
