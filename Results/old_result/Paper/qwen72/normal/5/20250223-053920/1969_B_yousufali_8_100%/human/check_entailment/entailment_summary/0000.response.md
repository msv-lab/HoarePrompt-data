**Reasoning:**

To determine if the program is correct, we need to analyze whether it meets the problem description and produces the correct output for the given test cases.

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given a binary string `s`.
   - We can perform cyclic shifts on any substring of `s` to sort the string in non-descending order.
   - The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - We need to find the minimum total cost to sort the string.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function reads a binary string `s` from user input.
     - It initializes `n` to count the number of '1's encountered and `ans` to accumulate the total cost.
     - For each character in the string:
       - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
       - If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
     - Finally, it prints `ans`.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases.
     - It then calls `func_1` `t` times, processing each test case individually.

3. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` aims to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string.
   - The logic in `func_1` is based on the observation that each '0' that appears after a '1' in the string requires a cyclic shift to move it to the correct position.
   - The cost of moving a '0' past `n` '1's is `n + 1` (since the substring length is `n + 1`).
   - This logic is correct because it ensures that all '0's are moved to the front of the string, and all '1's are moved to the back, which is the sorted order.

4. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - This ensures that the program processes each test case independently and prints the correct output for each.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the test case "10":
     - `n` is 1 (one '1' encountered).
     - The '0' is preceded by one '1', so the cost is `1 + 1 = 2`.
     - Output: 2 (correct).
   - For the test case "0000":
     - No '1's are encountered, so the cost is 0.
     - Output: 0 (correct).
   - For the test case "11000":
     - `n` is 2 (two '1's encountered).
     - The first '0' has `n = 2`, so the cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
     - The second '0' has `n = 2`, so the cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
     - The third '0' has `n = 2`, so the cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
     - Total cost: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.
     - Output: 9 (correct).
   - For the test case "101011":
     - `n` is 1 (one '1' encountered).
     - The first '0' has `n = 1`, so the cost is `1 + 1 = 2`.
     - `n` is 2 (two '1's encountered).
     - The second '0' has `n = 2`, so the cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
     - Total cost: 2 + 3 = 5.
     - Output: 5 (correct).
   - For the test case "01101001":
     - `n` is 0 (no '1's encountered).
     - The first '1' sets `n` to 1.
     - The first '0' after the '1' has `n = 1`, so the cost is `1 + 1 = 2`.
     - The second '1' sets `n` to 2.
     - The second '0' after the '1's has `n = 2`, so the cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
     - The third '0' after the '1's has `n = 2`, so the cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
     - The fourth '0' after the '1's has `n = 2`, so the cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
     - Total cost: 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 11.
     - Output: 11 (correct).

Given the above reasoning and verification, the program correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
