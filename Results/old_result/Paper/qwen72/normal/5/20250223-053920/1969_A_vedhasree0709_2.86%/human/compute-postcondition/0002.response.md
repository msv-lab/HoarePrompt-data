The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `p`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `p` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `p_i` satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i â‰  i, and all `p_i` are distinct. The function returns a result based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `p`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, and `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers, each between 1 and `n` and not equal to its index. The function returns a result based on these parameters.**
