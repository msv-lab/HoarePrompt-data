Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it only checks for a very specific pattern (`l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1`) and prints `2` if it finds it, otherwise it prints `3`. This approach is too simplistic and does not account for the general structure of the problem.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

The expected output is:
```
2
3
2
```

However, the program will output:
```
3
3
2
```

In the first test case, the program should output `2` because sending invitations to friends 4 and 5 will result in both of them attending the party. The program fails to identify this correct solution and outputs `3` instead. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
