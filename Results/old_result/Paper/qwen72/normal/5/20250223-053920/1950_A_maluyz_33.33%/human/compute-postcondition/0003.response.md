The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function might internally use or generate values for `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The function's output is not specified, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function internally uses or generates values for `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9. The specific return value or output of the function is not provided.**
