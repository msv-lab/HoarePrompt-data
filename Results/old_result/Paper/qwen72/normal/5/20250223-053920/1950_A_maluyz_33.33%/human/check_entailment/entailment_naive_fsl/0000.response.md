Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program incorrectly identifies a sequence where `a < b` and `b > c` as "PEAK" even if `a` and `c` are not the same. For example, for the input `1 5 2`, the program will output "PEAK" instead of "NONE", which is incorrect according to the problem description. The correct condition for a peak should be `a < b > c` and `a != c`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This version correctly handles the peak condition and avoids the issue mentioned.
