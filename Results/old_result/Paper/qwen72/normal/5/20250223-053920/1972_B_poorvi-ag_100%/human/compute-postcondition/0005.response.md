The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `results`. For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. The state of `t` and the content of `arr` are not relevant to the execution of the loop, as they are not part of the loop head.

To ensure the loop executes, `results` must be a non-empty list. The variable `i` will take the value of each element in `results` during each iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is the same input integer, `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration based on whether the count of 'U' in the input string `arr` was odd or even, respectively, and `results` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element in `results`**
