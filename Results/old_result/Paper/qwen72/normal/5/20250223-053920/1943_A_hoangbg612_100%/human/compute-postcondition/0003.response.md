The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `n`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. `a` is a list of integers where each element is a non-negative integer less than `n`. `n` is an integer representing the size of the list `a`, and it is constrained such that `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters `a` and `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `a` (a list of integers), and `n` (size of the list `a`). For each test case, it returns a result based on the elements of `a` and the value of `n`.**
