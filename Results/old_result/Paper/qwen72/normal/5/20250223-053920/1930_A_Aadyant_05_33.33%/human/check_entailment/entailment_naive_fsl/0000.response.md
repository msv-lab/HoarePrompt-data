Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the input integers are not distinct. Specifically, the program sorts the list and then selects every second element starting from the first. However, this approach does not always yield the maximum score, especially when there are repeated elements.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
1 2 2 3 3 4
```

Expected output:
```
6
```

The optimal way to achieve the maximum score is to pair the numbers as follows:
- Pair 1 and 2: min(1, 2) = 1
- Pair 2 and 3: min(2, 3) = 2
- Pair 3 and 4: min(3, 4) = 3

The total score is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

However, the program will output:
```
5
```

This is because it pairs the numbers as follows:
- Pair 1 and 2: min(1, 2) = 1
- Pair 2 and 3: min(2, 3) = 2
- Pair 3 and 4: min(3, 4) = 3

But it misses the optimal pairing of the repeated elements (2, 2) and (3, 3), which would yield a higher score.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
