Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for each test case.**

However, the provided function definition:
```
def func():
```
does not match the problem description, as it does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should be:
```
def max_score(t, test_cases):
```
where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing 2n integers.
