You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    num = input()
    out = []
    for numbers in range(int(num)):
        list2 = []
        list1 = []
        a = input()
        a = int(a)
        b = input('')
        list1 = b.split()
        list1.sort()
        for i in range(a):
            list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))
        out.append(sum(list2))
        del list1[:]
        del list2[:]
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of 2n integers (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50) from user input, sorts the list, and sums every other element starting from the first one. It then appends this sum to a list `out`. After processing all test cases, it prints each sum in `out` to the console. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `num`, from the input.
   - It initializes an empty list `out` to store the results of each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `a` and the list of integers `b`.
   - It converts the list of integers `b` into a list of integers and sorts it in ascending order.
   - It then iterates over the sorted list, selecting every second element (starting from the first) and appending it to `list2`. This is because the minimum of each pair will always be one of the smaller elements in the sorted list.
   - It calculates the sum of the elements in `list2` and appends this sum to the `out` list.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `out` list.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
  - The algorithm correctly identifies that the optimal way to maximize the score is to always choose the smallest available number in each pair. This is achieved by sorting the list and selecting every second element.
  - The logic of selecting every second element from the sorted list ensures that we are always picking the minimum of each pair, which is the correct approach to maximize the score.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the input format correctly, reading the number of test cases and the number of pairs for each test case.
  - It correctly processes the input list and ensures that the list is sorted before selecting elements.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program uses sorting, which is \(O(n \log n)\) in complexity, and then iterates over the list, which is \(O(n)\). This is efficient enough given the constraints \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
