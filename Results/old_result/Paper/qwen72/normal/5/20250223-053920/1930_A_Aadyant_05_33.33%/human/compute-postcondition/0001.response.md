Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), `test_cases` is a list of lists where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for each test case, `num` is an input string, `out` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `out`, which does not affect the values of `t`, `test_cases`, or `num`. Therefore, the initial state remains the same, with the addition of `out` being an empty list.
