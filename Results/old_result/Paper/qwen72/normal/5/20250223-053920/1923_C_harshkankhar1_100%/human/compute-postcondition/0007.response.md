Output State: **`n` and `q` are unchanged, `a` is a list of prefix sums of the original `a`, `c` is unchanged, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[0]` is 0, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`: if `a[i]` (after the prefix sum) is greater than 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 1`; if `a[i]` (after the prefix sum) is less than or equal to 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 2`. The loop prints 'NO' for each query `(x, y)` where `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, and 'YES' otherwise.**
