Output State: **`n` and `q` are assigned the values from the input, `a` is a list where the first element is 0 and the subsequent elements are integers from the input, `c` is still expected to be processed, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, and the constraints on `n`, `q`, and the elements of `c` remain valid.**
