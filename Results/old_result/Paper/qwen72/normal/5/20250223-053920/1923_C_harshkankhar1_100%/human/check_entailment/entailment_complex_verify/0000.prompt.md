You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of positive integers and a series of queries `q`. The array `c` has a length `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and each element `c_i` is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9). The number of queries `q` is also a positive integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5. Each query is defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the start and end indices of a subarray of `c`. The sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `n` and `q` are unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[0]` is 0, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`: if `a[i]` is greater than 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 1`; if `a[i]` is less than or equal to 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 2`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `n` and `q` are unchanged, `a` is a list of prefix sums of the original `a`, `c` is unchanged, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[0]` is 0, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`: if `a[i]` (after the prefix sum) is greater than 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 1`; if `a[i]` (after the prefix sum) is less than or equal to 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 2`. The loop prints 'NO' for each query `(x, y)` where `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, and 'YES' otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an array `a` of positive integers and a series of queries `q`. It processes each query, which is defined by two integers `x` and `y` representing the start and end indices of a subarray of `a`. For each query, the function prints 'NO' if the sum of the subarray `a[x:y]` is less than the corresponding sum of the subarray `b[x:y]` or if `x` is equal to `y`. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not modify the input array `a` or the number of queries `q`. After the function concludes, `a` is a list of prefix sums of the original array, and `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[0]` is 0, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`: if `a[i]` (after the prefix sum) is greater than 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 1`; if `a[i]` (after the prefix sum) is less than or equal to 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 2`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the subarray is good but the sum of the elements in the subarray is equal to the sum of the elements in the constructed array `b`. Specifically, the program incorrectly prints "NO" for such cases. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
4 4
3 4
1 3
```
The program will output:
```
YES
NO
YES
NO
```
However, for the query (1, 3), the subarray is `1 2 1`. The sum of this subarray is 4. A possible array `b` that satisfies the conditions is `2 1 1`, which also sums to 4. Therefore, the subarray `1 2 1` is good, but the program incorrectly prints "NO" for this query.
