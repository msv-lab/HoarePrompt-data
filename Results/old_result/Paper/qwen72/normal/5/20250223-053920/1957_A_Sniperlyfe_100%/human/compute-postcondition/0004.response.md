The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the length of a stick. The length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, and each stick length is between 1 and 100 inclusive. The function returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency value by 3, where the frequency values are the counts of each unique stick length in the list `arr`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of stick lengths and returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique stick length by 3.**
