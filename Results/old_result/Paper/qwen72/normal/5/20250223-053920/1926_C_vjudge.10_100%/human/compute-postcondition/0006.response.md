The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `inf` and the list `values` are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `inf` remains 200001, `values` is a list where each element at index `i` (for 1 â‰¤ i < 200001) is the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to `i`**
