Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct for the given problem description. Here's why:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes an array `values` where `values[i]` will store the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`.

2. **Digit Sum Calculation**: For each integer from 1 to `2 * 10^5 + 1`, the program calculates the sum of its digits and adds this to the cumulative sum stored in `values`.

3. **Handling Test Cases**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads an integer `value` and prints the precomputed sum of digit sums up to that value.

4. **Efficiency**: The program precomputes the sums of digit sums in a single pass, which makes it efficient for handling multiple test cases within the time limit. The precomputation step runs in O(n) time, and each test case is handled in O(1) time.

5. **Correct Output**: The program correctly outputs the sum of the digit sums for each test case, as demonstrated by the example provided.

Given these points, the program meets the requirements of the problem and is correct.
