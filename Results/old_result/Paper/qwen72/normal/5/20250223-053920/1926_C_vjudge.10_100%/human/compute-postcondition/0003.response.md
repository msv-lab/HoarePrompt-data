The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `inf`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `1` and `inf`. The loop will execute if `inf` is greater than `1`. The variable `i` will start at `1` for the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is 1, `inf` must be greater than 1**
