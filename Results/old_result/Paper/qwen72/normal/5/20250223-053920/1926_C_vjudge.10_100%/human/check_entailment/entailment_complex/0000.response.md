### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then initializes a list `values` of size `inf` (which is set to 200001) with all elements set to 0. This list will store the cumulative sum of the digit sums for each integer from 1 to 200000.

2. **Precomputation:**
   - The function iterates over each integer from 1 to `inf - 1` (i.e., 200000).
   - For each integer `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits and adds this sum to the cumulative sum stored in `values[i - 1]`.
   - The result is stored in `values[i]`, so `values[i]` contains the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`.

3. **Processing Test Cases:**
   - For each of the `t` test cases, the function reads an integer `value` (which is `n` for that test case).
   - It then prints `values[value]`, which is the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `value`.

4. **Efficiency:**
   - The precomputation step runs in O(200000) time, which is acceptable given the constraints.
   - Each test case is processed in O(1) time by simply accessing the precomputed value in the `values` list.

5. **Correctness:**
   - The function correctly computes the sum of the digits for each integer from 1 to 200000.
   - The cumulative sum is stored in the `values` list, which is then used to quickly answer each test case.
   - The function handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It efficiently precomputes the cumulative sum of digit sums and uses this precomputation to answer each test case in constant time.

**Correctness: True**
