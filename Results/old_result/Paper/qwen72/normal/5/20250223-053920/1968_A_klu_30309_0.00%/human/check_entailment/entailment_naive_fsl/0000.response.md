Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `x` is a prime number correctly. According to the problem description, for a prime number `x`, the optimal `y` should be `1` because `gcd(x, 1) + 1 = 2`, which is the maximum possible value since `x` has no divisors other than `1` and itself. However, the program's logic in `func_1` will return `1` only if no other `y` is found that satisfies `x % y == 0`. This is incorrect because the loop starts from `x - 1` and goes down to `2`, and it will never find a `y` that satisfies `x % y == 0` for a prime `x` (other than `1`), but it will not return `1` as the optimal `y`.

Example input where the program fails:
```
Input:
3
10
7
6

Output:
5
1
3
```

For `x = 7` (a prime number), the program should return `1` as the optimal `y`, but it returns `1` only because the loop completes without finding any other valid `y`. This is not the intended behavior, and the program should explicitly return `1` for prime numbers.
