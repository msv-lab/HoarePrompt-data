Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to find an integer `y` (1 â‰¤ y < x) such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` plus `y` is maximized. The function iterates from `x-1` down to `2` to find the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x`. If it finds a divisor `y` such that `2 * y >= x`, it immediately returns `y` because this `y` will maximize the sum `gcd(x, y) + y`. If no such `y` is found, it returns the largest divisor found during the iteration. If no divisors are found, it returns `1`.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic. The function is checking if `x % y == 0` to find divisors, but it should be checking if `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized. The current implementation assumes that the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x` will maximize the sum, which is not always correct.

For example, consider `x = 10`. The divisors of `10` are `1, 2, 5`. The function will return `5` because it is the largest divisor less than `10`. However, `gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10`, while `gcd(10, 4) + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6` and `gcd(10, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4`. In this case, `y = 4` would actually maximize the sum, but the function returns `5`.

To fix this, the function should calculate `gcd(x, y) + y` for each `y` and keep track of the maximum value and the corresponding `y`.

Correctness: **False**
