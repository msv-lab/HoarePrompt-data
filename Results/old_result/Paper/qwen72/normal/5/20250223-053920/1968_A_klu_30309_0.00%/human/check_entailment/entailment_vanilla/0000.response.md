### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The function \( \gcd(x, y) \) is the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \) and calls the function `func_1(x)` to find the optimal \( y \).
   - The function `func_1(x)` works as follows:
     - It initializes `max_val` to 1.
     - It iterates over \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
     - If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) (i.e., \( x \% y == 0 \)), it checks if \( 2 * y \ge x \).
     - If \( 2 * y \ge x \), it returns \( y \) immediately.
     - Otherwise, it updates `max_val` to \( y \).
     - Finally, it returns `max_val`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm aims to find the largest \( y \) such that \( x \% y == 0 \) and \( 2 * y \ge x \).
   - If \( x \% y == 0 \), then \( \gcd(x, y) = y \). Therefore, \( \gcd(x, y) + y = y + y = 2 * y \).
   - The condition \( 2 * y \ge x \) ensures that \( y \) is as large as possible while still being a divisor of \( x \).
   - If no such \( y \) is found, the algorithm returns the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \), which is \( x-1 \) if \( x \) is prime.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2 \).
   - For \( x = 3 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \( \gcd(3, 1) + 1 = 2 \).
   - For \( x = 4 \), the possible \( y \) values are 1 and 2. The optimal \( y \) is 2, and \( \gcd(4, 2) + 2 = 4 \).
   - For \( x = 10 \), the possible \( y \) values are 1, 2, 5. The optimal \( y \) is 5, and \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10 \).

5. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases and the general case.
   - The logic ensures that the largest possible \( y \) is chosen, which maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It finds the optimal \( y \) for each test case and prints it.

Correctness: **True**
