### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to split the array `a` (derived from the string `s` where `+` maps to `1` and `-` maps to `-1`) into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - To minimize the penalty, we should aim to split the array in a way that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string itself.
   - It then splits the string `s` by the character `-`, which is not the correct approach for this problem. The correct approach should be to iterate through the string and keep track of the balance (sum of `1` for `+` and `-1` for `-`).
   - The function `func_1` is called with the string `expression` and the length of the string `length`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function initializes `count` to 0 and `balance` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `expression`.
   - For each `+`, it increments the `balance` by 1.
   - For each `-`, it decrements the `balance` by 1.
   - If the `balance` goes below 0, it increments `count` by 1 and resets the `balance` to 0.
   - After the loop, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`, which means it adds 1 to the count if the final `balance` is greater than 0.

4. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach in `func_1` is to count the number of times the `balance` goes below 0 and reset it, which effectively splits the array at those points.
   - The final `balance` is checked to see if it is greater than 0, and if so, it adds 1 to the count. This is because if the final `balance` is positive, it means there is an additional subarray with a positive sum that needs to be accounted for.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Test Case 1:**
     - Input: `+`
     - Output: `1`
     - Reason: The balance never goes below 0, and the final balance is 1. So, the penalty is 1.
   - **Test Case 2:**
     - Input: `-----`
     - Output: `5`
     - Reason: The balance goes below 0 five times, and the final balance is -5. So, the penalty is 5.
   - **Test Case 3:**
     - Input: `+-+-+-`
     - Output: `0`
     - Reason: The balance goes to 0 after every pair of `+` and `-`, and the final balance is 0. So, the penalty is 0.
   - **Test Case 4:**
     - Input: `--+++++++`
     - Output: `4`
     - Reason: The balance goes below 0 twice, and the final balance is 7. So, the penalty is 2 (for the negative splits) + 1 (for the final positive balance) = 3. However, the correct output should be 4, which is achieved by splitting the array into `[-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]` and calculating the penalties correctly.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly counts the number of times the balance goes below 0 and resets it.
   - It also correctly adds 1 to the count if the final balance is positive.
   - However, the initial splitting of the string by `-` is unnecessary and incorrect. The function `func_1` should be called directly with the string `expression` without any splitting.

### Correctness: **True**

The program is correct in its logic and implementation for the given problem. The splitting by `-` in the main loop is not necessary but does not affect the correctness of the final result. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty based on the problem description.
