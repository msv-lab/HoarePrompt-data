Output State: **`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field, where the second integer has been incremented by 1, and `d` is 'R'.** 

The initial state indicates that `obj` is a list of two integers representing coordinates, and `d` is 'R'. The code snippet `obj[1] += 1` increments the second integer in the list `obj` by 1. The value of `d` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated second integer in `obj` and the unchanged direction `d`.
