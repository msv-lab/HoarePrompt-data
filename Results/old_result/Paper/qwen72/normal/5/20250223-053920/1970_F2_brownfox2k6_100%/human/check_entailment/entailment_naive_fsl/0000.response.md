Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program only includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which handle the movement of entities and the elimination of players, respectively. However, the program does not include the necessary logic to handle the scoring of goals, the movement of the Quaffle to the center of the field after a goal is scored, or the final score output. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
