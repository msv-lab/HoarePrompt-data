### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, `(x3, y3)`, and `(x4, y4)`.

2. **Coordinate Checking:**
   - The program attempts to check if the coordinates form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes by comparing the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the points.
   - However, the conditions `if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4`, `if x1 == x2 and x3 == x4`, and `if x1 == x4 and x3 == x2` are not sufficient to handle all possible permutations of the coordinates. The coordinates could be in any order, and these conditions do not cover all cases.

3. **Side Length Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the side length of the square by taking the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the points that share the same x-coordinates.
   - This approach is flawed because it assumes a specific order of the coordinates, which is not guaranteed by the problem statement.

4. **Output:**
   - The area of the square is printed for each test case, but due to the incorrect side length calculation, the output may be incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
- To correctly determine the side length of the square, the program should:
  - Collect all four points.
  - Extract the unique x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
  - The side length of the square is the absolute difference between the two unique x-coordinates (or y-coordinates, since the square is symmetric).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        points = []
        for j in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Extract unique x and y coordinates
        x_coords = sorted(set([point[0] for point in points]))
        y_coords = sorted(set([point[1] for point in points]))
        
        # Calculate the side length
        side_length = abs(x_coords[1] - x_coords[0])
        
        # Print the area
        print(side_length ** 2)
```

### Explanation:
- **Extract Unique Coordinates:**
  - The program collects all four points and then extracts the unique x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
  - Since the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, there will be exactly two unique x-coordinates and two unique y-coordinates.
- **Calculate Side Length:**
  - The side length is calculated as the absolute difference between the two unique x-coordinates (or y-coordinates).
- **Print Area:**
  - The area of the square is the side length squared, which is printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not handle the coordinates in random order correctly. The corrected program ensures that the coordinates are processed in a way that correctly identifies the side length of the square.

Final: **False**
