Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the area of a square given its corner coordinates, with the sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The function `func` reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading four pairs of coordinates. It then checks the conditions to determine the side length of the square and prints the area.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Incomplete Handling of All Possible Configurations**: The program only checks for three specific configurations of the coordinates to determine the side length of the square:
   - `x1 == x3 and x2 == x4`
   - `x1 == x2 and x3 == x4`
   - `x1 == x4 and x3 == x2`

   While these configurations cover some valid cases, they do not cover all possible valid configurations of the square's corners. For example, the configuration where `x1 == x4` and `x2 == x3` (with corresponding y-coordinates) is not checked.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Side Length**: The program calculates the side length based on the y-coordinates when the x-coordinates are equal. However, it should also consider the x-coordinates when the y-coordinates are equal to determine the side length. The current logic only checks the y-coordinates, which can lead to incorrect results if the x-coordinates are the ones that are equal.

3. **No Handling of Invalid Input**: The problem statement guarantees that the input will always form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. However, the program does not handle or report invalid input, which is not a requirement but a potential improvement.

Given these issues, the program is not robust enough to handle all valid input configurations and may produce incorrect results for some valid test cases.

Correctness: **False**
