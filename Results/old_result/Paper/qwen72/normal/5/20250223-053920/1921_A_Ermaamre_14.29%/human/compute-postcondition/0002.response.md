Output State: **The loop will print the square of the side length of the square for each test case. The variables `x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4` will have their final values as the coordinates of the last test case, and `res` will be the side length of the last square. The variable `a` will remain unchanged.**
