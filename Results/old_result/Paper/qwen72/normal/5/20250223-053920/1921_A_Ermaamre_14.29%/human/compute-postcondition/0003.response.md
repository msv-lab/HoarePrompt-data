The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates are within the range -1000 to 1000, inclusive, and the square has a positive area with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.

For each test case, the function returns the area of the square. If the input does not represent a valid square (e.g., the coordinates do not form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes), the function returns an error message indicating invalid input.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It returns the area of the square for each valid test case. If a test case does not represent a valid square, it returns an error message indicating invalid input.**
