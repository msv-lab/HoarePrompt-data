Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function signature. Based on the problem description, the function should take two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, two lines of input: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a list of integers `a` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) of length `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

However, to properly define the function according to the problem description, the function signature should be updated to include these parameters. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def count_triangle_ways(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`.
