Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**: The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length. This is an efficient way to group the sticks by their lengths.

3. **Triangle Formation Conditions**:
   - The key insight here is that the lengths of the sticks are powers of 2 (`2^{a_i}`). The only way to form a non-degenerate triangle with these lengths is if all three sticks have the same length. This is because the sum of two smaller powers of 2 is always less than or equal to the next power of 2, and thus cannot satisfy the triangle inequality with a larger stick.
   - For example, `2^1 + 2^1 = 4` which is not greater than `2^2 = 4`, and `2^1 + 2^2 = 6` which is not greater than `2^3 = 8`.

4. **Counting Valid Triangles**:
   - The program correctly identifies and counts the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
   - However, the program also includes a part where it counts the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length using `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. This part is incorrect because it does not consider the triangle inequality. Specifically, if you have two sticks of length `2^a` and one stick of length `2^b` where `a != b`, the sum of the lengths of the two sticks of length `2^a` will always be less than or equal to `2^b` if `b > a`, and thus cannot form a non-degenerate triangle.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the total number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle. However, due to the incorrect part in the counting logic, the output may be incorrect for some test cases.

Let's analyze the test cases again with the correct logic:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `7`, `1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - All sticks have the same length `2^1 = 2`.
  - The number of ways to choose 3 sticks from 7 is `math.comb(7, 3) = 35`.
  - The program correctly outputs `35`.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `4`, `3 2 1 3`
  - Stick lengths are `2^3 = 8`, `2^2 = 4`, `2^1 = 2`, `2^3 = 8`.
  - There are 2 sticks of length 8 and 1 stick of length 4 and 2.
  - The only valid triangles are formed by choosing 3 sticks of the same length, which is not possible here.
  - The program incorrectly outputs `2` because it includes the invalid combinations of 2 sticks of length 8 and 1 stick of length 4 or 2.

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `3`, `1 2 3`
  - Stick lengths are `2^1 = 2`, `2^2 = 4`, `2^3 = 8`.
  - No three sticks have the same length, and no combination of three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.
  - The program correctly outputs `0`.

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input: `1`, `1`
  - Only one stick is given, so it is impossible to form a triangle.
  - The program correctly outputs `0`.

The program is incorrect because it includes invalid combinations in the count for forming non-degenerate triangles. The correct logic should only count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length.

Final: **False**
