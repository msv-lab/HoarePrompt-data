### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`:**
   - The function reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case (length `n` and the array `arr`).
   - This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases and ensures that the input is correctly parsed and processed.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.
   - However, the problem requires checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operation (splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix) any number of times, not just if it is already sorted.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The current implementation of `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient.
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if there exists a split point such that the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping the prefix and suffix.
   - Specifically, we need to find a split point `i` such that:
     - The prefix `arr[:i]` is sorted.
     - The suffix `arr[i:]` is sorted.
     - The last element of the prefix is less than or equal to the first element of the suffix.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`, there is no split point that can make the array non-decreasing after any number of operations, so the output should be 'No'.
   - For the array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`, we can split at index 1 to get `[7]` and `[9, 2, 2, 3]`, and then swap to get `[9, 2, 2, 3, 7]`. We can split again at index 1 to get `[9]` and `[2, 2, 3, 7]`, and then swap to get `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`, which is non-decreasing, so the output should be 'Yes'.
   - For the array `[1, 2, 3]`, it is already sorted, so the output should be 'Yes'.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect because it only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operation.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
