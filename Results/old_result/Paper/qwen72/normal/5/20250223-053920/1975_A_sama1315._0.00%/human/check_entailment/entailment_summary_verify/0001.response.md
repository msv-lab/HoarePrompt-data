### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them.
   - The operation can be performed any number of times, including zero times.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No' if there is any element that is greater than the next element.
   - However, this function does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the swap operation.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin.read` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are collected and printed.

4. **Identifying the Flaw in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It does not check if the array can be sorted by performing the swap operation.
   - For example, the array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]` can be sorted by performing the following operations:
     - Split the array into `[7]` and `[9, 2, 2, 3]` and swap them to get `[9, 2, 2, 3, 7]`.
     - Split the array into `[9]` and `[2, 2, 3, 7]` and swap them to get `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`, which is sorted.
   - The current `func_1` would return 'No' for this array, which is incorrect.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if there exists a split point such that the array can be split into two parts, and when these parts are swapped, the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - This involves checking if the array can be split into two parts where the maximum element of the first part is less than or equal to the minimum element of the second part.

### Conclusion:
The provided `func_1` is incorrect because it only checks if the array is already sorted and does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the swap operation. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the flaw in `func_1` and concluding that the program is incorrect. The function `func_1` needs to be modified to consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the swap operation.
