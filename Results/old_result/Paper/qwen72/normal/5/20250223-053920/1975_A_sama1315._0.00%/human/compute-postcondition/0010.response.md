The function `func_2` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `arr`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `arr`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 1,000,000. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the exact return value is not specified.**
