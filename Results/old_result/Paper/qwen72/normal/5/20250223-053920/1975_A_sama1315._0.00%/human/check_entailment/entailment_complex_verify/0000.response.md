Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, which does not account for the possibility of making the array non-decreasing by swapping a prefix and a suffix. This is a critical flaw in the logic, as demonstrated by the example `[3, 1, 2]` provided in the original assessment. The function should instead check if there exists a valid split point such that the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping the prefix and suffix.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should:
1. Identify if there is a point in the array where the elements are out of order.
2. Check if the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping the prefix and suffix at that point.

The current implementation of `func_1` does not perform these checks, and thus the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
