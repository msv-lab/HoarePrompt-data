Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `arr` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `index` is equal to the length of `data`, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding `arr` list.
