The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads 4 tuples of coordinates (x_i, y_i) from the input, where each tuple represents a corner of a square. The function then calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and prints the area of the square (side length squared). The function does not return any value; it only prints the area for each test case. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the input coordinates are not stored or modified after processing.
