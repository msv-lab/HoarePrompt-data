Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly calculates the area of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square and stores them in a list `a`.

2. **Extracting X-coordinates**: It extracts the x-coordinates of the corners into a list `x`.

3. **Calculating Side Length**: It calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`). Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference in x-coordinates is equal to the difference in y-coordinates.

4. **Calculating Area**: It prints the area of the square, which is `dx * dx`.

This approach is correct because:
- The problem guarantees that the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
- The side length of the square can be determined by the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates).
- The area of the square is the side length squared.

Thus, the program will correctly compute the area for each test case.
