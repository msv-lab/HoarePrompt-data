Precondition: **The function should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of 4 tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates x_i, y_i are within the range -1000 to 1000, and the square has a positive area with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.**

Note: The function definition provided is incomplete. A more appropriate function definition would be:
```python
def func(test_cases):
```
Where `test_cases` is a list of lists, each inner list representing a test case with the coordinates of the square's corners.
