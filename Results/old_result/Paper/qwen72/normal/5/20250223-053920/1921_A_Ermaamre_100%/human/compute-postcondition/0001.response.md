The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will take on values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop's execution.

Since the state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is an integer provided by the user and must be within the range 1 to 100, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `_` is 0**
