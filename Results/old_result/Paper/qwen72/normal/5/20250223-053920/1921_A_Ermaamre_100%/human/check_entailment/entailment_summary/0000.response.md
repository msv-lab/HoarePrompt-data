Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The key points to consider are:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading 4 sets of coordinates.
2. **Coordinate Extraction**: For each test case, the program extracts the x-coordinates from the given points.
3. **Side Length Calculation**: The side length of the square is calculated by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference in x-coordinates will be the same as the difference in y-coordinates, which is the side length of the square.
4. **Area Calculation**: The area of the square is correctly calculated by squaring the side length.
5. **Output**: The program prints the area for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

However, there is a potential issue that needs to be addressed:

- **Assumption of Square Validity**: The problem guarantees that the input coordinates form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Therefore, the program's approach of using the difference in x-coordinates to determine the side length is valid. However, if the input were not guaranteed to form a valid square, this approach might fail. For example, if the input coordinates were not forming a square but a rectangle, the program would still compute an area, but it would be incorrect.

Given the problem's constraints and guarantees, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
