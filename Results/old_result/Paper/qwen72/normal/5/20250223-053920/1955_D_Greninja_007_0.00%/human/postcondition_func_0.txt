The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of `n` integers, a list `b` of `m` integers, and an integer `k`, where `1 <= k <= m`. It returns the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` elements whose frequencies match or are less than the frequencies of the corresponding elements in `b`. The function does not modify the input lists `a` or `b`. After the function concludes, the input parameters remain unchanged, and the return value is the number of such "good" subarrays.
