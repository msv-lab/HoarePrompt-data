You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of good subsegments of array `a` based on the criteria given in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Frequency Counters**:
   - `b_freq` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in array `b`.
   - `window_freq` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in the initial window of length `m` from array `a`.

3. **Initial Matches**:
   - The program calculates the initial number of matches between the elements in the window and the elements in `b` using the `min` function to ensure it only counts the minimum occurrences of each element in both counters.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to move through array `a` and update the `window_freq` and `matches` accordingly.
   - For each position `i` from `0` to `n - m - 1`:
     - If the current number of matches is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the `good_subarrays` counter.
     - It updates the frequency of the element that is sliding out of the window (`a[i]`).
     - It updates the frequency of the element that is sliding into the window (`a[i + m]`).
     - It recalculates the number of matches after the window slide.

5. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, it checks if the last window (from `a[n-m]` to `a[n-1]`) is a good subarray and increments the `good_subarrays` counter if it is.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, including:
- Handling multiple test cases.
- Ensuring the window size is correct.
- Correctly updating the frequency counters and matches during the sliding window process.
- Checking the final window after the loop.

Given the above, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.
