Precondition: **The function definition provided does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_new_problems(a, b):` where `a` and `b` are lists of integers of the same length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and both `a` and `b` are sorted in non-decreasing order with elements in the range 1 to 10^9.**
