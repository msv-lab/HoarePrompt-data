You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < n and j < n:
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            a.pop(-1)
            a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]
            cnt += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            j += 1
    print(cnt)

def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a single list `arr` as a parameter and returns a new list that is sorted in descending order. The function does not use the parameters `a` and `b` mentioned in the annotations, and it will result in an error if `arr` is not defined. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that a new list, sorted in descending order, is returned, and the original list `arr` remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the array `a` of current problem difficulties, and the array `b` of expected problem difficulties.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of new problems proposed and two indices `i` and `j` to iterate through the arrays `a` and `b`.

3. **Main Loop**: The program uses a while loop to iterate through both arrays `a` and `b` simultaneously. The loop continues as long as both indices are within the bounds of their respective arrays.

4. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, the program checks if the current expected difficulty `b[j]` is less than the current problem difficulty `a[i]`. If this condition is true, it means the current problem is too difficult and needs to be replaced.

5. **Problem Replacement**: 
   - The program removes the most difficult problem from `a` using `a.pop(-1)`.
   - It then inserts the expected difficulty `b[j]` into the array `a` at the correct position to maintain the non-decreasing order.
   - The counter `cnt` is incremented to reflect the new problem proposed.
   - The index `j` is incremented to move to the next expected difficulty.

6. **Increment Indices**: If the current problem difficulty `a[i]` is not greater than the expected difficulty `b[j]`, the indices `i` and `j` are both incremented to move to the next pair of difficulties.

7. **Output**: After processing all elements in the arrays, the program prints the counter `cnt`, which represents the minimum number of new problems needed.

8. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is defined but not used in the program. This function sorts an array in descending order, which is not necessary for the given problem.

9. **Efficiency and Correctness**:
   - The program maintains the non-decreasing order of `a` by inserting the new difficulty at the correct position.
   - The program correctly handles the removal of the most difficult problem and the insertion of the new problem.
   - The logic ensures that the minimum number of new problems is proposed to make `a[i] <= b[i]` for all `i`.

However, there is a potential issue with the insertion logic. The program uses `a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]` to insert the new difficulty, which is inefficient for large arrays. A more efficient approach would be to use a binary search to find the correct insertion position and then use list insertion.

Despite this inefficiency, the program is logically correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
