To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `test_case` and `test_cases`.

1. **`test_cases`**: This is the list that the loop iterates over. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple.
2. **`test_case`**: This is the variable that will hold each tuple from `test_cases` during each iteration. It should be initialized to the first tuple in `test_cases`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even) and two strings of length n, consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
- `results` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute:
- `test_cases` must have at least one tuple.
- `test_case` should be the first tuple in `test_cases`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `test_case` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list**
