You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_j satisfies 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
        
    #State: For each test case, if the loop completes all iterations without encountering a negative value in `b` and the last two elements of `b` are both 0, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `a` is modified as per the operations inside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` and a list `b` of `a` integers. It then iterates through the list `b` and modifies its elements according to specific operations. If at any point an element in `b` becomes negative, or if the last two elements of `b` are not both zero after the loop, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input parameters `t` and `n`. The list `b` is modified during the process but is not retained after the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Rudolf can perform an operation where he selects an index \( i \) (2 ≤ \( i \) ≤ \( n-1 \)) and decreases \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using this operation.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array itself \( b \).
   - It then iterates through the array from the first element to the second-to-last element.
   - For each element \( b[i] \):
     - If \( b[i] \) is negative, it immediately prints 'NO' and breaks the loop.
     - It updates \( b[i+1] \) by subtracting \( b[i] \times 2 \).
     - It updates \( b[i+2] \) by subtracting \( b[i] \).
     - It sets \( b[i] \) to zero.
   - After the loop, it checks if the last two elements \( b[-1] \) and \( b[-2] \) are zero.
   - If both are zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the array elements are not initially non-negative. The problem statement guarantees that all elements are non-negative, so this check is unnecessary.
   - The program updates \( b[i+1] \) and \( b[i+2] \) based on \( b[i] \), but it does not ensure that these updates do not make \( b[i+1] \) or \( b[i+2] \) negative. This can lead to incorrect results.
   - The program does not consider the cumulative effect of the operations on the entire array. For example, if \( b[i] \) is large, it can make \( b[i+1] \) and \( b[i+2] \) negative, which is not allowed.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that the cumulative effect of the operations does not make any element negative.
   - We can use a greedy approach where we try to make each element zero by using the operation as many times as possible on the current element and checking if the resulting array is valid.

5. **Correctness Evaluation:**
   - The given program does not correctly handle the cumulative effect of the operations, which can lead to incorrect results.
   - For example, consider the array [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]. The program will correctly output 'YES' for this case, but it will fail for cases where the cumulative effect makes elements negative.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the cumulative effect of the operations, which can lead to negative elements in the array. This violates the problem constraints and can produce incorrect results.
