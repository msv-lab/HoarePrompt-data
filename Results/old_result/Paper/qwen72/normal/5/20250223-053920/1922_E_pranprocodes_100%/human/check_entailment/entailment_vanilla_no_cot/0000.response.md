Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to construct an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. However, the logic used to construct the array is flawed and does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

1. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing the Array:**
   - The program uses a loop to construct the array by appending either the maximum or minimum value based on whether `x` is even or odd.
   - When `x` is even, it appends the maximum value and decrements `max`, then divides `x` by 2.
   - When `x` is odd, it appends the minimum value and increments `min`, then subtracts 1 from `x`.
   - This approach does not ensure that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The number of increasing subsequences in an array is not simply determined by the parity of `x` and the values appended.

2. **Handling of `x = 1`:**
   - The program stops when `x` becomes 1, but it does not handle the case where `x` is initially 1. The problem description states that `2 \le X \le 10^{18}`, so `x` should never be 1 initially. However, the program does not explicitly handle the case where `x` is 1 after the loop.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the length of the array and the array itself, but it does not handle the case where it is impossible to find the required array. The problem description requires printing `-1` if no such array exists.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, you need to construct an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. One possible approach is to use a binary representation of `X` to construct the array. Each bit in the binary representation of `X` can correspond to a position in the array, and the values can be chosen to ensure that the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        if x == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the binary representation of x
        binary = bin(x - 1)[2:]
        n = len(binary)
        
        # Construct the array
        ans = []
        for j in range(n):
            if binary[j] == '1':
                ans.append(j)
        
        # Print the result
        print(n)
        print(*ans)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Binary Representation:**
  - The number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented using the binary representation of `X - 1`. This is because the number of increasing subsequences in an array of length `n` with distinct elements is \(2^n\).
  - By constructing an array where the positions of 1s in the binary representation correspond to the elements in the array, we can ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`.

- **Handling `x = 1`:**
  - If `x` is 1, it is impossible to find an array with exactly 1 increasing subsequence (since the problem states `2 \le X \le 10^{18}`), so the program prints `-1`.

- **Constructing the Array:**
  - The array is constructed by appending the index `j` for each bit that is 1 in the binary representation of `X - 1`.

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the length of the array and the array itself, ensuring the output format is correct.

This corrected program should work for the given problem description.
