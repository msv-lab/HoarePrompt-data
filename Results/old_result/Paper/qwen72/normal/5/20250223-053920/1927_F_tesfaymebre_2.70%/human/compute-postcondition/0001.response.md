The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be a positive integer (greater than 0). Since `test_cases` is assigned the value returned by `func_1()`, we need to ensure that `func_1()` returns a value that is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment**
