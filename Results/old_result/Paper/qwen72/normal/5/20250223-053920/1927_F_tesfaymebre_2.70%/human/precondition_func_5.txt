The function `func_6` does not take any parameters, but it relies on the `func_3` function to provide the necessary inputs. `func_3` is expected to return a tuple of two integers (n, m) where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges in the graph, and for each of the m edges, a tuple (u, v, w) where u and v are the vertices connected by an edge and w is the weight of that edge. The graph is represented using an adjacency list `graph` and a list of edges `edges`. The graph is undirected, and the edges are sorted in non-increasing order of their weights. The `DSU` class is used to manage the union-find data structure, and `colors` is a list used to track the color of nodes during a depth-first search (DFS).
