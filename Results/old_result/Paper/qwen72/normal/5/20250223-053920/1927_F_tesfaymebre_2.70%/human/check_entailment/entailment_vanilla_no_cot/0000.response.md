Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Union-Find (DSU) Implementation Missing**: The program references a `DSU` class, but the implementation of this class is not provided. The `DSU` class is crucial for managing the connected components and finding cycles in the graph.

2. **Incorrect Cycle Detection**: The cycle detection logic in `func_6` and `dfs` is flawed. The program attempts to detect a cycle by checking if the current node has already been visited (`colors[curr] == 1`). However, this approach does not guarantee that the cycle found is the one with the minimum weight edge. Additionally, the `dfs` function does not correctly handle the backtracking to find the cycle path.

3. **Edge Sorting and Union-Find Usage**: The program sorts the edges in descending order of weight and then uses the union-find data structure to try to find cycles. However, this approach is not optimal for finding the cycle with the minimum weight edge. The correct approach would be to sort the edges in ascending order and then use union-find to detect the first cycle that forms, which will have the minimum weight edge.

4. **Cycle Path Construction**: The `dfs` function is supposed to construct the cycle path, but it does not correctly handle the backtracking to ensure that the path is a simple cycle. The current implementation may return a path that is not a cycle or may include nodes that are not part of the cycle.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you should:
- Sort the edges in ascending order of weight.
- Use a union-find data structure to detect the first cycle that forms.
- Once a cycle is detected, use a depth-first search (DFS) to construct the cycle path.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import sys

class DSU:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n))
        self.rank = [0] * n
        self.min_edge = [float('inf')] * n

    def find(self, u):
        if self.parent[u] != u:
            self.parent[u] = self.find(self.parent[u])
        return self.parent[u]

    def union(self, u, v, w):
        root_u = self.find(u)
        root_v = self.find(v)
        if root_u == root_v:
            return False
        if self.rank[root_u] > self.rank[root_v]:
            self.parent[root_v] = root_u
            self.min_edge[root_u] = min(self.min_edge[root_u], self.min_edge[root_v], w)
        elif self.rank[root_u] < self.rank[root_v]:
            self.parent[root_u] = root_v
            self.min_edge[root_v] = min(self.min_edge[root_u], self.min_edge[root_v], w)
        else:
            self.parent[root_v] = root_u
            self.rank[root_u] += 1
            self.min_edge[root_u] = min(self.min_edge[root_u], self.min_edge[root_v], w)
        return True

def dfs(graph, start, parent, path, visited):
    visited[start] = 1
    path.append(start)
    for neighbor in graph[start]:
        if neighbor == parent:
            continue
        if visited[neighbor] == 1:
            cycle_start = path.index(neighbor)
            return path[cycle_start:]
        elif visited[neighbor] == 0:
            cycle = dfs(graph, neighbor, start, path, visited)
            if cycle:
                return cycle
    path.pop()
    visited[start] = 2
    return []

def func_6():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        (u, v, w) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        graph[u].append((v, w))
        graph[v].append((u, w))
        edges.append((w, u, v))
    edges.sort()
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        if not dsu.union(u, v, w):
            cycle = dfs(graph, u, -1, [], [0] * (n + 1))
            print(w, len(cycle))
            print(*cycle)
            return

def func_7():
    test_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        func_6()

func_7()
```

### Key Changes:
- **DSU Class**: Added a proper implementation of the union-find data structure with path compression and union by rank.
- **Edge Sorting**: Sorted the edges in ascending order of weight.
- **Cycle Detection**: Used the union-find data structure to detect the first cycle that forms.
- **Cycle Path Construction**: Used a DFS to construct the cycle path correctly.

This corrected program should now correctly find and output the simple cycle with the minimum weight edge for each test case.
