Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` reads a line from the standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, converts the resulting string to an integer, and returns this integer.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns the first line of input from the user, with any leading or trailing whitespace removed.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and returns an iterator that yields integers. These integers are derived from a space-separated string input from the standard input (stdin), after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace and splitting the string by spaces. The function does not modify any external state or variables.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input and returns a list of these integers. The function does not modify any external variables or state; it only processes the input and returns the resulting list.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the standard input (stdin), removes any leading and trailing whitespace, splits the input into separate strings based on spaces, and returns a list of these strings. If no input is provided or the input is only whitespace, an empty list is returned.
Function number 6 :
 Code:

def func_6():

''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves the number of vertices and edges in an undirected graph from the `func_3` function. It then constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph and a list of edges, each with a weight, and sorts the edges in non-increasing order of their weights. Using a union-find data structure (`DSU`), it processes the edges to find the minimum weight edge that successfully connects two previously unconnected components. The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the vertices of this minimum weight edge and prints the minimum edge weight and the number of vertices visited during the DFS. It also prints the list of vertices visited during the DFS traversal. The final state of the program includes an updated union-find data structure, a sorted list of edges, and the printed results.
Function number 7 :
 Code:

            if res and node_v in set_res:
                return res
    colors[curr] = 2
    return []
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search in a graph. It accepts three parameters: `curr` (the current vertex in the graph), `parent` (the parent vertex of `curr` in the DFS traversal), and `path` (a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal). The function marks the current vertex as being processed and appends it to the path. It recursively explores all unprocessed neighbors of the current vertex that are not the parent. If a neighbor's DFS traversal returns a path containing a specific node `node_v`, the function returns this path. If no such path is found, the function marks the current vertex as fully processed and returns an empty list.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        func_6()
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves the number of test cases from the function `func_1` and then calls the function `func_6` that many times. After the function concludes, the variable `test_cases` holds the value returned by `func_1`, and no other variables are affected. The function does not return any value, so it may return `None` by default.
