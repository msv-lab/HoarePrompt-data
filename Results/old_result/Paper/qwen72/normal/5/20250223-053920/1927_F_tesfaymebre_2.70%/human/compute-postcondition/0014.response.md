To determine what will be printed by the `print(_min_edge, len(res))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables step by step:

1. **`graph`**: This is a `defaultdict` of type `list` containing the adjacency lists for each vertex. Each vertex in the graph has a list of its adjacent vertices.

2. **`edges`**: This list is sorted in descending order based on the weight of the edges. This means the edges with the highest weights come first, and the edges with the lowest weights come last.

3. **`DSU` class and `colors` list**: The `DSU` class is used for Disjoint Set Union operations, and `colors` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`. This list is used to track the colors of the vertices, but it is currently all zeros.

4. **`dsu` instance**: This instance of the `DSU` class has updated its parent and rank information to reflect the union operations performed. This means that the `dsu` instance now has a structure that represents the connected components of the graph.

5. **`_min_edge`**: This variable is set to the minimum edge weight that was successfully unioned. This means that among all the edges that were processed and successfully merged two components, `_min_edge` holds the weight of the edge with the smallest weight.

6. **`node_u` and `node_v`**: These variables are set to the vertices that were part of the edge with the minimum weight that was successfully unioned. This means that `node_u` and `node_v` are the vertices connected by the edge with weight `_min_edge`.

7. **`res`**: This variable is set to the result of the `dfs` function called with `node_u`, `-1`, and an empty list. The `dfs` function is likely a depth-first search that traverses the graph starting from `node_u`, with `-1` as the initial parent (indicating no parent), and an empty list to store the result of the traversal.

Given this information, let's determine what will be printed:

- **`_min_edge`**: This will be the minimum edge weight that was successfully unioned. Since the exact value of `_min_edge` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe it as the minimum edge weight that was successfully unioned.

- **`len(res)`**: This will be the length of the list `res` returned by the `dfs` function. The `dfs` function is called with `node_u` as the starting vertex, and it will traverse the graph starting from `node_u`. The length of `res` will be the number of vertices visited during the DFS traversal starting from `node_u`.

Output: **_min_edge, len(res) (where _min_edge is the minimum edge weight that was successfully unioned, and len(res) is the number of vertices visited during the DFS traversal starting from node_u)**
