Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the minimum number of cards left in the hand after performing the specified operations. The key steps are:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, the number of cards `n`, and the exchange number `k`. It also reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: If `k` is greater than `n`, the program correctly prints `n` because no operation can be performed, and the number of cards remains unchanged.

3. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in `nums`, but it caps the frequency at `k`. This is a crucial step because it helps in determining if there are any card numbers that can be exchanged.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - If any card number has a frequency exactly equal to `k`, the program prints `k - 1` because you can exchange `k` cards of the same number for `k - 1` cards.
   - If no card number has a frequency exactly equal to `k`, the program prints `n`, which is incorrect. The correct approach should be to determine the minimum number of cards that cannot be exchanged, which is the remainder when the total number of cards is divided by `k`.

The program's logic for determining the minimum number of cards left is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if k in freq.values()` is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of cards left. Instead, the program should calculate the remainder of `n` divided by `k` to find the minimum number of cards that cannot be exchanged.

Correctness: **False**

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the program, you should calculate the remainder of `n` divided by `k` to determine the minimum number of cards left. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        min_cards_left = n % k
        print(min_cards_left)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
    return frequency_table
```

This fix ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.
