Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `k`. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from `arr`, and the value for each key is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, capped at `k`. The values of `arr` and `k` remain unchanged. **
