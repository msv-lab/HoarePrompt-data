To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given State:
- `n` is updated to `n - (n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1))`
- `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18
- `n` is not equal to `k`
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`
- `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`
- `h` is `n // (n - k + 1)`
- `i` is `n - k + 1`
- `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in costs:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `costs`.
2. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `costs`.

### Current State:
- `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`
- `i` is `n - k + 1`

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop will execute once for each element in `costs`.
- After the first iteration, `i` will be set to the next element in `costs`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **First Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n - k + 1`
   - The loop body is executed with `i` as `n - k + 1`.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `i` is set to the next element in `costs`, which is `1`.
   - The loop body will be executed with `i` as `1`.

### Final State:
- `n` remains updated to `n - (n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1))`
- `k` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18
- `n` is not equal to `k`
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`
- `costs` remains a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`
- `h` remains `n // (n - k + 1)`
- `i` is now `1`
- `curr` remains `n // (n - k + 1)`

### Final State:
State: **`n` is updated to `n - (n - k + 1) * (n // (n - k + 1))`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // (n - k + 1)`, `i` is `1`, `curr` is `n // (n - k + 1)`**
