The value of `bc` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `bc` was either 0 (if `i` is not 'A') or 2 (if `i` is 'A'). Therefore, the new value of `bc` will be 1 if `i` is not 'A', or 3 if `i` is 'A'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `s` is an input string with at least three characters, `i` is the third character of `s`, `ac` is 0 if `i` is not 'A' or 2 if `i` is 'A', `bc` is 1 if `i` is not 'A' or 3 if `i` is 'A'.**
