Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or some other character, and the length of `path` is at least 1; `n` is the length of `path` and is greater than 0; `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n`. If the first element of `path` is '@', `dp[0]` is set to 1. If the first element of `path` is '*', `dp[0]` is set to `-inf`. If the first element of `path` is neither '@' nor '*', `dp[0]` remains 0. If `n` > 1, `dp[1]` is updated as follows: If the second element of `path` is '*', `dp[1]` is set to `-inf`. If the second element of `path` is not '*', `dp[1]` is updated based on the value of `dp[0]` and whether `path[1]` is '@': If `path[0]` is '@' and `path[1]` is '@', `dp[1]` is 2. If `path[0]` is '@' and `path[1]` is not '@', `dp[1]` is 1. If `path[0]` is '*' and `path[1]` is '@', `dp[1]` is `-inf`. If `path[0]` is '*' and `path[1]` is not '@', `dp[1]` is `-inf`. If `path[0]` is neither '@' nor '*' and `path[1]` is '@', `dp[1]` is 1. If `path[0]` is neither '@' nor '*' and `path[1]` is not '@', `dp[1]` is 0. If `n` is 1, `dp` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(2, n):
    if path[i] == '*':
        dp[i] = -float('inf')
    else:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or some other character, and the length of `path` is at least 3; `n` is the length of `path` and is greater than 2; `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n`; `dp[0]` is set based on the first element of `path`; `dp[1]` is updated based on the second element of `path` if `n` > 1; `i` is 2. If `path[i]` is '*', then `dp[2]` is set to `-float('inf')`. Otherwise, `dp[2]` is set to `max(dp[1], dp[0])` plus 1 if `path[2]` is '@', otherwise `dp[2]` is set to `max(dp[1], dp[0])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or some other character, and the length of `path` is at least 3; `n` is the length of `path` and is greater than 3; `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n`, where `dp[0]` is set based on the first element of `path`, `dp[1]` is updated based on the second element of `path` if `n` > 1, and `dp[2]` is set based on the third element of `path`. If `path[3]` is '*', `dp[3]` is set to `-float('inf')`. Otherwise, `dp[3]` is set to `max(dp[2], dp[1]) + (1 if path[3] == '@' else 0)`. `i` is 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or some other character, and the length of `path` is at least 3; `n` is the length of `path` and is greater than 4; `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n`, where `dp[0]` is set based on the first element of `path`, `dp[1]` is updated based on the second element of `path` if `n` > 1, `dp[2]` is set based on the third element of `path`, and `dp[3]` is set based on the fourth element of `path`. If `path[4]` is '*', then `dp[4]` is set to `-inf`. Otherwise, `dp[4]` is set to `max(dp[3], dp[2]) + (1 if path[4] == '@' else 0)`. `i` is 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
