The code snippet assigns the value of `curr_v` to the element in the `permutation` list at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i`. Let's break down the changes:

- `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is updated to `curr_v`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1.
- `curr_v` is the number of multiples of `k` that fit into `n` plus one.

Therefore, the element at index 1 in the `permutation` list is set to the value of `curr_v`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i * k]` is set to `i + 1` for all valid `i` (i.e., `i * k < n`), `permutation[1]` is now `curr_v`, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is the number of multiples of `k` that fit into `n` plus one, `i` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1**.
