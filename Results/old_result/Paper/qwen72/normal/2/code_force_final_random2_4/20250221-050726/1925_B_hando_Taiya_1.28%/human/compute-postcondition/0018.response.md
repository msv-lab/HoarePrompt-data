Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer where x >= 1, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 2, and `ans` is 1. If `x % i == 0` (i.e., `x` is divisible by 2), and if `n` <= `x // 2`, `ans` is set to 2. If `n` is greater than `x // 2` but `n` <= 2, `ans` is set to the maximum of 1 and `x // 2`. If neither condition is met, `ans` remains 1. If `x % i != 0` (i.e., `x` is not divisible by 2), `ans` remains 1.***
