Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is the integer value of the minute part of the new input, `h` is the integer value of the hour part of the new input.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))` reads a new input in the format "hh:mm" and assigns the hour part to `h` and the minute part to `m`. The values of `t`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged. The new values of `h` and `m` are derived from the input, and the conditions for `h` and `day` mentioned in the initial state are not yet applied.
