The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t` and the current value of `_`. The loop iterates as long as `_` is less than `t`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is an integer read from input, with 1 <= t <= 100.
- `cases` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is `(n, s)` and the second tuple is also `(n, s)`.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is an integer read from the next line of input.
- `s` is a string read from the next line of input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `_` needs to be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2.
- `t` must still be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer read from input, 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is `(n, s)` and the second tuple is also `(n, s)`, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer read from the next line of input, `s` is a string read from the next line of input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `s` is updated to a new string read from the next line of input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**
