Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the new user-provided integer, `k` is the new user-provided integer, `x` is the new user-provided integer, `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` as an empty list, which overrides the previous definition of `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
