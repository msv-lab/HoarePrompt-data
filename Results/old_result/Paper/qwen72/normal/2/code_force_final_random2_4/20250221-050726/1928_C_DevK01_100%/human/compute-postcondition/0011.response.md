Postcondition: **`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `M` is a list containing the integer value `[1]` if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. `w` is the square root of `q`, `i` is 1, and `q` is divisible by `i` (which is 1). Additionally, the quotient of `q` divided by `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If `i` is less than `x - 1`, `M` remains an empty list.**
