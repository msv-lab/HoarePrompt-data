### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges on a grid of size `n x m`.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to install supports for a single row.
   - The function iterates through the row and updates the cost for each cell based on the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells plus the current cell's depth plus one.
   - The final cost for the row is the value in the last cell after processing.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and the grid of depths.
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows by summing the costs of these rows and selecting the minimum sum.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - **State Before `func_1` Call:**
     - `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first and last elements are 0, representing the depths of the river cells in a row.
     - `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= len(row).
   - **First Loop in `func_1`:**
     - The first `d-1` elements are incremented by 1.
   - **Second Loop in `func_1`:**
     - For each element from index `d-1` to the end, the cost is updated to the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells plus the current cell's depth plus one.
   - **Return Value of `func_1`:**
     - The function returns the value of the last element in the list `row`, which represents the total cost for the row.
   - **State Before `func_2` Call:**
     - `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m.
     - `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells.
   - **Processing in `func_2`:**
     - The function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
     - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
     - It then finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows by summing the costs of these rows and selecting the minimum sum.

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Input Handling:** The input is read correctly, and the grid is parsed into a list of lists.
   - **Cost Calculation:** The cost calculation in `func_1` is correct. It ensures that the cost for each cell is the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells plus the current cell's depth plus one.
   - **Consecutive Rows:** The function correctly calculates the total cost for `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The input handling, cost calculation, and finding the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows are all handled correctly.

Final: **True**
