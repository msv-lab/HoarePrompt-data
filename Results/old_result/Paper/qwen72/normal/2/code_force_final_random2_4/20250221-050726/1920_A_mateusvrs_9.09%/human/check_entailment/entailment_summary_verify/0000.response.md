### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and its logic step-by-step to ensure it meets the requirements of the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - It initializes:
     - `cx` as a set to store values that `k` cannot be (type 3 constraints).
     - `ax` as a large number (initially set to \(10^9 + 7\)) to represent the minimum upper bound (type 2 constraints).
     - `bx` as a small number (initially set to -1) to represent the maximum lower bound (type 1 constraints).
   - For each constraint, it updates:
     - `bx` to the maximum of the current value and the constraint value if the constraint is of type 1.
     - `ax` to the minimum of the current value and the constraint value if the constraint is of type 2.
     - Adds the constraint value to `cx` if the constraint is of type 3.

3. **Calculating the Result:**
   - If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, it means there is no valid range for `k`, so it appends 0 to the result list.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` in the range `[bx, ax]` by:
     - Counting the number of invalid values in `cx` that fall within this range.
     - Subtracting this count from the total number of integers in the range (`ax - bx + 1`).

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

### Validation:

- **Type 1 Constraints (k ≥ x):**
  - The program correctly updates `bx` to the maximum value of `x` encountered.
- **Type 2 Constraints (k ≤ x):**
  - The program correctly updates `ax` to the minimum value of `x` encountered.
- **Type 3 Constraints (k ≠ x):**
  - The program correctly adds `x` to the set `cx`.

- **Range Calculation:**
  - If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, the program correctly returns 0.
  - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers by subtracting the count of invalid values in the range from the total number of integers in the range.

### Edge Cases:

- **No Overlapping Range:**
  - If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, the program correctly returns 0.
- **Single Valid Value:**
  - If `bx` and `ax` are the same and there are no invalid values in `cx` within this range, the program correctly returns 1.
- **Multiple Invalid Values:**
  - The program correctly handles multiple invalid values within the range by counting them and subtracting from the total.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem. The logic is sound, and the implementation is consistent with the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
