Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer input by the user, `nodes` is a defaultdict where `nodes[u]` now includes `v` in its list of adjacent nodes and `nodes[v]` now includes `u` in its list of adjacent nodes, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `u` and `v` are integers provided by the user, `nodes[u]` now includes `v` in its list of adjacent nodes.**

Explanation: The code `nodes[u].append(v)` adds `v` to the list of adjacent nodes for `u`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
