Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `lex` is the last input integer processed, `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, `temp` is the character corresponding to `info[0][2]` converted to a lowercase letter followed by the character corresponding to `info[0][3]` converted to a lowercase letter, followed by the character corresponding to `info[0][3]` converted to a lowercase letter.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `temp` is the character corresponding to `info[0][2]` converted to a lowercase letter followed by the character corresponding to `info[0][3]` converted to a lowercase letter.
- The code `temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)` appends the character corresponding to `info[0][3]` (since `i` is 0 and `j` is 3) converted to a lowercase letter to `temp`.
- Therefore, `temp` now includes the original characters plus the additional character from `info[0][3]` converted to a lowercase letter.
