Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = l[0]
    b = 0
    c = 0
    y = 0
    for y in range(1, n):
        if l[y] > l[y - 1]:
            b = l[y]
            break
    for x in range(y + 1, n):
        if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
            if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
            c += 1
        elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
            if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
        elif a >= l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    print(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or `n-1` if no such element exists, `a` is the last element in `l` that was greater than or equal to the previous elements up to the point where it was updated, `b` is the last element in `l` that was greater than the previous elements up to the point where it was updated, and `c` is the count of how many times an element in `l` was found to be greater than both `a` and `b` during the loop execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index where the loop broke or `n-1` if it did not break, `a` is the last element in `l` that was less than or equal to the previous elements encountered during the loop, `b` is the last element in `l` that was greater than the previous elements encountered during the loop, and `c` is the count of elements in `l` that were greater than both `a` and `b` and met the specific update conditions within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index where the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element is found, or `y` is `n-1` if no such element exists, `a` is the last element in `l` that is less than or equal to all elements from `l[y+1]` to `l[n-1]`, `b` is the last element in `l` that is greater than or equal to all elements from `l[y+1]` to `l[n-1]`, and `c` is the count of elements in `l` from `l[y+1]` to `l[n-1]` that are greater than both `a` and `b` when they were initially set.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
