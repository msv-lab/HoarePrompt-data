### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the minimum total cost of building `k` bridges across `k` consecutive rows of a grid, where each bridge must have supports at specific intervals.
   - The cost of placing a support in a cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
   - The supports must be placed in the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(row: List[int], d: int)`:**
     - This function processes a single row of the grid.
     - It increments the first `d-1` elements by 1.
     - For each subsequent element, it sets the value to the minimum of the previous `d+1` elements (or 0 if fewer than `d+1` elements) plus the current value plus 1.
     - The function returns the value of the last element in the modified list, which represents the cost of placing supports in that row.
   - **`func_2()`:**
     - This function reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
     - It reads `n` rows of the grid.
     - It computes the cost of placing supports for each row using `func_1`.
     - It then finds the minimum sum of every contiguous subsequence of `k` elements in the `costs` list and prints this minimum sum.

3. **Correctness Verification:**
   - **`func_1`** correctly calculates the cost of placing supports in a single row by ensuring the constraints are met (supports in the first and last columns, and the distance constraint).
   - **`func_2`** correctly reads the input, processes each row using `func_1`, and finds the minimum total cost for building `k` bridges across `k` consecutive rows.
   - The logic in both functions aligns with the problem requirements and the provided examples.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it meets all the specified requirements and constraints of the problem.

**Correctness: **True****
