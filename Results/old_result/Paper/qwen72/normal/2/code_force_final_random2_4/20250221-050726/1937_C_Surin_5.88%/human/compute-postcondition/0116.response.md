Based on the initial state:

- `kp` is 2
- `n` is greater than 2
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is 0
- `i` is 2
- `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`
- `v2` is 2
- `r` is the user input. If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is set to 1.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Let's analyze the values of the variables involved:

- `v1` is initially 0.
- `v2` is 2.
- The value of `v1` might change based on the user input `r`. If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is set to 1. Otherwise, `v1` remains 0.

Since the problem does not specify the value of `r`, we need to consider both cases:

1. If `r` is `<`:
   - `v1` will be set to 1.
   - The print statement will output: `? 1 1 2 2`.

2. If `r` is not `<`:
   - `v1` will remain 0.
   - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 2 2`.

Since the exact value of `r` is not provided, we need to consider both possibilities. However, the problem asks for the output based on the initial state, which does not specify the value of `r`. Therefore, we should consider the most general case where `r` could be either `<` or something else.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] 2 2 (where [v1] is 1 if r is <, otherwise [v1] is 0)**
