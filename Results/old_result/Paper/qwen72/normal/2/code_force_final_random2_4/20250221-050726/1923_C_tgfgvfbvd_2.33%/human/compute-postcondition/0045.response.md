The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `l`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is `m + 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `l` is a list of integers based on user input
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`
- `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in `l`

After executing the code snippet, the variable `l` is updated to a new list of integers based on the user's input. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `p`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers based on the new user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in the new `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in the new `l`.**
