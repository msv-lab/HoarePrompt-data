Reasoning:  
The program aims to make a string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters to eliminate the substrings "map" and "pie". The function `func_1` iterates through the string, removing occurrences of "map" and "pie" and counting the number of removals. However, there is a specific condition where the function checks if the string is exactly "mapie" and returns 1. This special case is unnecessary because the general logic of the function should handle this case correctly without needing an explicit check.

Additionally, the function only removes two characters when it encounters "map" or "pie", which is incorrect. To properly remove these substrings, it should remove three characters for "map" and three characters for "pie". The current implementation will not correctly count the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of the substrings "map" and "pie".

Correctness: **False**
