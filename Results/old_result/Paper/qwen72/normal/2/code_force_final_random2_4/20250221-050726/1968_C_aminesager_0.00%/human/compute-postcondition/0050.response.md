The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts no direct parameters but reads from an input source (like standard input) where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, the next line contains an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), followed by a line containing a list of `n-1` integers `x` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500). The function processes each test case and returns the missing integer from the list `x` for each test case. The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` integers `x`. It returns the missing integer from the list `x` for each test case.**
