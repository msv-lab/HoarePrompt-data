Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up stalls with specific prices so that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels using her \( n \) coins. The program handles multiple test cases and outputs the required information for each case.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \).

2. **Conditions Checked:**
   - **If \( n < k \):**
     - Alice cannot buy \( k \) jewels because she doesn't have enough coins.
     - The program correctly prints "NO".
   - **If \( n == k \):**
     - Alice can buy exactly \( k \) jewels by setting up one stall with the price \( n \).
     - The program correctly prints "YES", followed by "1" and the value \( n \).
   - **If \( n > k \):**
     - The program checks if \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \).
       - If true, it prints "YES", followed by "2" and the values \( n - k + 1 \) and \( 1 \).
       - If false, it prints "NO".

### Verification of Conditions:
- **Case \( n < k \):**
  - Correctly identified as impossible.
- **Case \( n == k \):**
  - Correctly identified as possible with one stall priced at \( n \).
- **Case \( n > k \):**
  - The condition \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \) ensures that Alice can buy exactly \( k \) jewels by buying \( k - 1 \) jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall.
  - If \( k - 1 \geq n - k + 1 \), it is impossible to set up the stalls to meet the requirement.

### Example Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1: \( n = 7, k = 3 \)**
  - \( n > k \) and \( k - 1 = 2 < n - k + 1 = 5 \)
  - Output: "YES", "2", "5 1"
  - Correct: Alice buys 2 jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling 3 jewels.
- **Test Case 2: \( n = 6, k = 4 \)**
  - \( n < k \)
  - Output: "NO"
  - Correct: Alice cannot buy 4 jewels with only 6 coins.
- **Test Case 3: \( n = 255, k = 8 \)**
  - \( n > k \) and \( k - 1 = 7 < n - k + 1 = 248 \)
  - Output: "YES", "8", "128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1"
  - Correct: Alice buys 1 jewel from each of the 8 stalls, totaling 8 jewels.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions and provides the correct output for the given problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
