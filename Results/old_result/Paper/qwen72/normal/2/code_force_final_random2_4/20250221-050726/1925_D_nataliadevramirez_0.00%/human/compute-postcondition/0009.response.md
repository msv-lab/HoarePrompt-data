Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**. 

The code assigns the return value of the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` to the variable `result`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` remain unchanged. The new state includes the updated value of `result` which is now the output of the function call.
