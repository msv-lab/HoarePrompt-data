To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the objects in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(m - 2):
```

The only variable in the loop head is `m`. The loop will execute if `m - 2` is greater than 0, which means `m` must be greater than 2.

Given the initial state:
- `m` is greater than 2
- `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a1` is the first integer from the user input
- `a2` is the first integer from the new user input
- `a3` is the first integer from another new user input (if applicable)
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input
- `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input
- `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the third user input (if applicable)
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`
- `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions encountered during the loop
- `idx1` is `n - 2`
- `idx2` is `n - 2`

Since `m` is already stated to be greater than 2, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute. The other variables and lists mentioned in the state are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state remains as follows:
State: **`m` is greater than 2, `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `n` is greater than 1, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `a3` is the first integer from another new user input (if applicable), `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the third user input (if applicable), `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions encountered during the loop, `idx1` is `n - 2`, and `idx2` is `n - 2`.**
