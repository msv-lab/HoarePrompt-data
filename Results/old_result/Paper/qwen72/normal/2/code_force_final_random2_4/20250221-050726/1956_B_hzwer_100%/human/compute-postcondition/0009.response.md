Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least two elements, `cnt` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `cnt[x]` which is now 2, `x` is the second element in the list `a`.** 

Explanation: The code `cnt[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the list `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt[x]` was 1, so after the increment, `cnt[x]` becomes 2. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
