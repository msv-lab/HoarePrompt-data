To determine what will be printed by the `print(s, sep='')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic leading up to the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` remains 1 if the loop completes all iterations without breaking.
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a` is a list containing two input strings.
- `s` is a string formed based on certain conditions.
- `x` is the index where the condition is met or `n-1` if the condition is never met.
- `i` is `x-1`.
- If the loop breaks before completing all iterations, `t` is updated to `x - i + 1` where `i` is the index at which the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]` is met, and `i` is the index at which the loop broke.

### Analysis:
1. **String `s` Formation**: The string `s` is formed based on certain conditions, but the exact conditions are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact content of `s` without more information.
2. **Loop Behavior**: The loop iterates over the indices of the string `s` and checks the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]`. If this condition is met, the loop may break, and `t` is updated accordingly.
3. **Print Statement**: The `print(s, sep='')` statement will print the string `s`.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact conditions for forming `s` are not provided, we can only describe the output in general terms. The string `s` is formed based on the conditions described, and the `print` statement will output this string.

Output: **s (where s is the string formed based on the conditions described in the initial state)**
