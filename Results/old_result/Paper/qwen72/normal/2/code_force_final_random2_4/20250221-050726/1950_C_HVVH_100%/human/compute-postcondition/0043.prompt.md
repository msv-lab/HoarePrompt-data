Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, day is 'AM', n is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
    if h == 0:
        h = 12
        day = 'AM'
    elif h > 12:
        h = h - 12
        day = 'PM'
    else:
        day = 'AM'
        if h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
    print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer representing the minute part of the input time. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` remains 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is reduced by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is less than or equal to 12, `h` remains unchanged, and `day` is set to 'PM' if `h` is 12, otherwise `day` remains 'AM'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is the integer value of the minute part of the new input. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` remains 'AM'. If `h` > 12, `h` is adjusted to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is the integer value of the minute part of the new input, `h` is the integer value of the hour part of the new input. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` > 12, `h` is reduced by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
