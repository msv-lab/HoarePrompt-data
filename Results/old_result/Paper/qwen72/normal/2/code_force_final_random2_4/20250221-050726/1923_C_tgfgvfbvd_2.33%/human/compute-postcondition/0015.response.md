To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for _ in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop head involves the variable `_` and the variable `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` and `m` are integers based on user input
- `l` is a list of integers based on user input
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`
- `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in `l`

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `m` to ensure it is greater than 0. The variable `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is a placeholder and its value does not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers based on user input, `l` is a list of integers based on user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in `l`, `m` must be greater than 0**
