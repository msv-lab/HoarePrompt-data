You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
        L1 = list(set(L1))
        print(len(L1))
        continue

def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:
        M += [w]
    i = 1
    while i < w:
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
        i += 1
    return M



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`, where `q` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) and `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < q\). It returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, including both the divisor and its corresponding quotient if the quotient is also greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If the square root of `q` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it is also included in the list `M`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find all possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \) fit the described pattern.
   - The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and it alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of numbers from 1 to \( k \).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) must satisfy the condition \( n \equiv x \pmod{2k-2} \) or \( n \equiv 2k - x \pmod{2k-2} \).
   - The value \( y = n + x \) must be even for there to be any valid \( k \).

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is even.
   - If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 and moves to the next test case.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calls `func_1` with arguments \((y - 2) // 2\) and \( x \) to find potential values of \( k \).
   - It also checks if \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) and adds more potential values of \( k \) using `func_1` with arguments \((n - x) // 2\) and \( x \).
   - The results are combined, duplicates are removed, and the length of the unique list is printed.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` takes two arguments \( q \) and \( x \).
   - It initializes an empty list \( M \) to store potential values of \( k \).
   - It calculates the square root of \( q \) and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \). If so, it adds it to \( M \).
   - It iterates through all integers \( i \) from 1 to the square root of \( q \) and checks if \( q \) is divisible by \( i \). If so, it adds both \( i \) and \( q // i \) to \( M \) if they are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - Finally, it returns the list \( M \).

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the evenness check for \( y \).
   - The use of `func_1` to find potential values of \( k \) is appropriate.
   - The combination of results and removal of duplicates ensures that only unique values of \( k \) are counted.
   - The logic for checking additional conditions when \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
