Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of `n == k` Case**: When `n == k`, the solution prints a single stall with the price equal to `n`. This is correct because Alice will buy exactly one jewel from this stall and spend all her coins. However, the solution should also consider the possibility of setting up more than one stall to achieve the same result, which might be necessary in other scenarios.

2. **Handling of `k - 1 < n - k + 1` Case**: The condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is used to decide whether to set up two stalls with specific prices. This logic is flawed because it does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the solution sets up two stalls with prices `8` and `1`. Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, but she will have 1 coin left, which means she will not buy the required 3 jewels.

3. **General Case Handling**: The solution does not provide a general method to set up the stalls for any valid `n` and `k`. It only handles a few specific cases and fails to cover the broader range of possibilities.

A correct solution should ensure that Bob can always set up the stalls in such a way that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, given the constraints. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        if k <= 60:
            print(k)
            print(*[1] * k)
        else:
            # Use the first 60 stalls to buy 1 jewel each, then use the remaining stalls to buy the rest
            remaining = k - 60
            print(60)
            print(*([1] * 59 + [n - remaining + 1]))

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

This solution ensures that:
- If `n < k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.
- If `k <= 60`, it sets up `k` stalls, each with a price of 1 coin, ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
- If `k > 60`, it sets up 60 stalls, with the first 59 stalls priced at 1 coin each and the last stall priced to ensure Alice buys the remaining jewels.
