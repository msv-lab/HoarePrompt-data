To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
```

The variables in the loop head are:
- `i`
- `n`

For the loop to execute, the expression `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1, meaning `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` will start at 0.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 0
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` and `m` are input integers
- `a1` is the first integer from the input
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input
- `a2` is the first integer from the new input
- `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`
- `idx1` is -1
- `idx2` is -1
- `p1` is 0
- `p2` is 0

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 0.

State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0**
