Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], ((1000 - T[0]) - T[1]) - T[2]]`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is 0, `line` is the new input string, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the new `line` and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation:
- The code appends a new element to the list `a`. This new element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`.
- Given `i` is 3, `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]`, which is `(1000 - T[0]) - T[1]`.
- `T[i - 1]` is `T[2]`.
- Therefore, the new element appended to `a` is `((1000 - T[0]) - T[1]) - T[2]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
