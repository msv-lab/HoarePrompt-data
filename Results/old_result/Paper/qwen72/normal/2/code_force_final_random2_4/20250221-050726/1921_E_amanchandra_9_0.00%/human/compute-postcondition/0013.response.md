To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `i` is 0.
- `h` is an input integer.
- `w` is an input integer.
- `xa` is an input integer.
- `ya` is an input integer.
- `xb` is an input integer.
- `yb` is an input integer.
- `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`.
- `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`, and the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even.
- `l` is `max(1, ya - x)`.
- `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `x`:**
   - `x = (abs(xa - xb) // 2)`, where `abs(xa - xb)` is even.
   - This means `x` is half the distance between `xa` and `xb`.

2. **Calculate `l` and `r`:**
   - `l = max(1, ya - x)`: This ensures `l` is at least 1 and at most `ya - x`.
   - `r = min(w, yb + x)`: This ensures `r` is at most `w` and at least `yb + x`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` needs to be evaluated.
   - `abs(l - yb) <= x` checks if the distance between `l` and `yb` is less than or equal to `x`.
   - `abs(r - yb) <= x` checks if the distance between `r` and `yb` is less than or equal to `x`.

4. **Determine the Output:**
   - If both conditions are true, the expression `(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[True]` evaluates to `['Bob']`.
   - If either condition is false, the expression `(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[False]` evaluates to `['Draw']`.

5. **Unpack the List:**
   - The `*` operator unpacks the list, so if the list is `['Bob']`, it will print `Bob`.
   - If the list is `['Draw']`, it will print `Draw`.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the logic of the print statement, the output will be either `Bob` or `Draw` depending on the conditions `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x`.

Output: **Bob (if both conditions `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x` are true) or Draw (if either condition is false)**
