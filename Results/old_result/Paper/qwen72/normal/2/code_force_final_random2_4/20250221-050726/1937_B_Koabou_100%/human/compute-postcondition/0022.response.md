Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two elements where each element is a user input, `_` is 1, `s` is either an empty list or "a0cd", `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `i` is 1, and `i` must be less than `n - 1`.** 

Explanation: The value of `y` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
