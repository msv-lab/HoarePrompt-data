Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is an empty list if `b[n-2]` is not equal to `b[n-1]`, otherwise `ans1` is a list containing the element `b[n-1]` twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is now equal to 2 times its original value minus 2 if `b[n-2]` is equal to `b[n-1]`, otherwise `k` is 2 times its original value, `req` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if the first element of `b` is not equal to the second element of `b`, otherwise `l` is an empty list, and if `b[n-2]` is not equal to `b[n-1]`, `l` now contains the last element of `b` (`b[n-1]`).***
