Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, `nabors` must be greater than 0, `aa` is a list of strings representing the input values with at least `n` elements, `bb` is a list of strings from the input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the elements in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, `n` must be greater than `m`. Additionally, the value of `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, and the current value of `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.**
