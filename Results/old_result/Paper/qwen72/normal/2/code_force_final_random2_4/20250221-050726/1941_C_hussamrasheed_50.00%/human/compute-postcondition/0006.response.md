Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `p` is calculated as the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the string `s`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
