The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` integers. It calculates a list `a` of `n` integers based on the input list, where each element is derived from the previous element minus the corresponding element from the input list. The function then prints the elements of `a` in reverse order, separated by spaces. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to `0`, `n` being the last input integer, `a` being the final calculated list, and `result` being the string representation of `a`.
