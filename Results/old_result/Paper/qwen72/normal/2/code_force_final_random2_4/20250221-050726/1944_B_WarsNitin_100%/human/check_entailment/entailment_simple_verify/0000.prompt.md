You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 1
    
    1 2 2 1
    
    6 1
    
    6 4 2 1 2 3 1 6 3 5 5 4
    
    4 1
    
    1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
    
    6 2
    
    5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2

Output

    2 1
    2 1
    6 4
    1 3
    1 2
    1 2
    5 1 3 3
    6 4 2 4
    
Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `q` is `t - 1`, `ans1` and `ans2` contain the selected elements from `b` and `c` respectively, ensuring that each element in `ans1` and `ans2` is part of the pairs or unique elements as required by `k`. `k` is 0, indicating that the required number of elements has been added to `ans1` and `ans2`. The lists `b` and `c` remain sorted, and `l` contains the unique elements from `b` that were not paired. The original values of `n`, `k` (before modification in the loop), and `req` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect for certain cases:

1. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program attempts to handle edge cases by checking the first and last elements of the sorted halves of the array. However, this approach is flawed because it doesn't guarantee that the required number of elements will be selected correctly. Specifically, the logic for appending elements to `l` and then using `l` to balance the counts in `ans1` and `ans2` is not robust.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Selecting Elements**: The program tries to select pairs of identical elements from the sorted halves of the array. However, it does not ensure that the XOR condition is met for the selected elements. The XOR condition is crucial, and the current logic does not guarantee that the XOR of the elements in `ans1` will be equal to the XOR of the elements in `ans2`.

3. **Potential Off-by-One Errors**: The program uses indices like `b[n-2]` and `c[i-1]`, which can lead to off-by-one errors, especially when the array lengths are small.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```
Expected Output:
```
1 2
1 2
```
or any other valid pair of subsets that satisfy the conditions.

However, the provided program might produce an incorrect output because it does not correctly handle the selection of elements to ensure the XOR condition is met.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly in ensuring that the XOR condition is met for the selected subsets. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
