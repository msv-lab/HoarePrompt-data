The function `func` is designed to process multiple test cases, each involving a chessboard and a series of moves. The function accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer representing the size of the chessboard, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5.
  - `k`: An integer representing the number of moves already played, where 0 ≤ k ≤ n.
  - A list of `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)`, each representing a move made on the chessboard, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n.

The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the given moves and the size of the chessboard. However, the specific output for each test case is not explicitly defined in the provided information. Given the context, the function likely returns some form of analysis or state of the game after processing the moves.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with the size of a chessboard `n`, the number of moves `k`, and a list of `k` moves `(r_i, c_i)`. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the moves and the size of the chessboard.**
