Output State: **`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k` before the execution, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. `in_aa` and `out_aa` are the next elements in `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` respectively, and both `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` must have at least one more element each. The value of `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1. `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1.**
