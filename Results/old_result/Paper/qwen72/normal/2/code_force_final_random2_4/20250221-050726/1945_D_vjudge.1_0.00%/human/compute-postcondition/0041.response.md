Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from user input, followed by two lists of integers `lista_A` and `lista_B` of length `n`. It reverses both lists. The function then calculates a value `resultado` which is the minimum of a series of sums involving elements from `lista_A` and `lista_B`, specifically focusing on the last `k` elements of the lists. The final value of `resultado` is printed. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **
