The code snippet `val.append((a3, l3))` adds a tuple containing the current value of `a3` and the list `l3` to the list `val`.

Given the initial state:
- `a3` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.
- `val` is an empty list.
- `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`.
- `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`.
- If the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at position `idx2`, and `l` is now a reference to `l1`.
- If the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`, `a2` is inserted into `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`, and `l` is now equal to `l2`.
- If `m` is 2, `i` is `n-2`, and the conditions involving `idx1`, `idx2`, and `p2` are as described in the initial state.
- If `m` is not 2, all variables retain their initial values.

After executing the code snippet:
- `val` is no longer an empty list; it contains the tuple `(a3, l3)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a3` is assigned the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`, if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at position `idx2`, and `l` is now a reference to `l1`, if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`, `a2` is inserted into `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`, and `l` is now equal to `l2`, if `m` is 2, `i` is `n-2`, and the conditions involving `idx1`, `idx2`, and `p2` are as described in the initial state, if `m` is not 2, all variables retain their initial values.**
