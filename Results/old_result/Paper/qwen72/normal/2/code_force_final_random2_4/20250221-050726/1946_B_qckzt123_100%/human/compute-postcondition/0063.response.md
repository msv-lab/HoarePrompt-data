Output State: **`t` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of `a` that does not drop below zero, `tmp` is 0 or the sum of the last contiguous subarray of `a` that did not drop below zero, `_` is equal to the length of the list `a`, `T` remains unchanged and must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- `t` holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of `a` where the sum never goes below zero.
- `tmp` will be 0 if the last contiguous subarray's sum dropped below zero, or it will hold the sum of the last contiguous subarray that did not drop below zero.
- `_` will be equal to the length of the list `a`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in the list.
- The variables `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial values.
