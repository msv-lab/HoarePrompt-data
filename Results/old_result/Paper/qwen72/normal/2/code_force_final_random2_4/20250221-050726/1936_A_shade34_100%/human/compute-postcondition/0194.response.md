Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is 2, `mak` is 2, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `s` is the user input string, `pans` is `[2]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pans = [i]` assigns the list containing the value of `i` (which is 2) to the variable `pans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects this update to `pans` while keeping all other variables the same.
