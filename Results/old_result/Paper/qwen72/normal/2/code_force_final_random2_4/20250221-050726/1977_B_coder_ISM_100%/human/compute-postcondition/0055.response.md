Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, and `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0'. If `flag` is 0 and `s[2]` is '1' and `s[3]` is '1', then `s[2]` is set to `'-1'` and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1 and `s[2]` is '0', then `s[1]` is set to '1' and `flag` is set to 0. If none of these conditions are met, `s[0]` remains '0', `flag` remains 0, or `s[2]` is not equal to `s[3]`, or `s[2]` is not '1'.***
