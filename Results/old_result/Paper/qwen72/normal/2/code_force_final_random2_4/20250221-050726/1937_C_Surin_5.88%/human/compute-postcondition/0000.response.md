The code defines a lambda function `I` that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, maps each element to an integer, and returns the resulting list. This function can be used to read inputs for further processing in the program.

Output State: **The function `I` is defined to read a line of input, split it into integers, and return them as a list. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged: The function operates within an interactive environment where it interacts with a hidden permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1, and it must find two indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized using at most 3n queries. The function receives input through a series of queries and outputs the result of the queries and the final answer in a specific format. The number of test cases t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.**
