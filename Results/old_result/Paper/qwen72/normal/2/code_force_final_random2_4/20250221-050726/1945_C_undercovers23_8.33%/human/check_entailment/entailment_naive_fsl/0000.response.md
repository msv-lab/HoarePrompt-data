Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in how it calculates the satisfaction percentages for the left and right sides of the road. Specifically, the program calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` using percentages, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect comparisons. The problem requires checking if at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied, which can be done directly without converting to percentages.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house correctly. The logic for these edge cases is flawed, leading to potential incorrect outputs.

Here is a specific test case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5
11000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
The program might output a different value because it incorrectly calculates the satisfaction conditions using percentages and does not properly handle the edge cases for placing the road before the first or after the last house.

The correct approach should directly check the counts of satisfied residents on both sides without converting to percentages and should handle the edge cases correctly.
