Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`mak`**: According to the initial state, `mak` is 0.
2. **`i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is 1.
3. **`mak` (second occurrence)**: This is the same as the first occurrence, so it is also 0.
4. **`i` (second occurrence)**: This is the same as the first occurrence, so it is also 1.

### Final Output:
The print statement will print the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i` in that order.

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
