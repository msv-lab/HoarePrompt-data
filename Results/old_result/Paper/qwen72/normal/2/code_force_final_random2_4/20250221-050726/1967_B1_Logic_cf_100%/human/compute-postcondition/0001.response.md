The only objects in the loop head are the variable `T` and the input integer `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `T` should be initialized to 0 (the starting point of the range).

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0**
