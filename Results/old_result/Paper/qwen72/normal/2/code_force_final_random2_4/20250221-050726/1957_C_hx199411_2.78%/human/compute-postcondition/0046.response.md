Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, now `t` is `t - 1` (and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again), `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, `num` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is initialized to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `t` is decremented by 1, and it must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing.
