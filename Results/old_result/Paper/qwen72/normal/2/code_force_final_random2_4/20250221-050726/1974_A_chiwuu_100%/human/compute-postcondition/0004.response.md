Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer (converted from its original string value), `b` is an integer (converted from its original string value).** 

The code `b = int(b)` converts the string value of `b` to an integer, updating the type of `b` from a string to an integer. All other variables remain unchanged.
