Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` remains `new_n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj` is a list of lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` in the input, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` in the input. The variables `t`, `z`, `leftover`, `x`, and the condition `R - L <= 1` remain unchanged. `L` is now 1. `R` is now 100001. `numCuts` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` remains `new_n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj` is a list of lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` in the input, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` in the input. The variables `t`, `z`, `L`, and `R` are updated based on the condition: if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or if `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001, then `L` is set to 50001 and `R` remains 100001; otherwise, `L` remains 1 and `R` is set to 50001. The variable `numCuts` is either greater than `k`, equal to `k` with `leftover` being greater than or equal to 50001, or less than or equal to `k` with `leftover` being less than 50001. The variable `x` is 50001, and `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` remains `new_n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj` is a list of lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` in the input, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` in the input. `t` and `z` remain unchanged. `numCuts` is now 0, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, and `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call. If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `L` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`. Otherwise, `R` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` remains `new_n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj` is a list of lists as described, `t` and `z` remain unchanged, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call. If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `L` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`. Otherwise, `R` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
