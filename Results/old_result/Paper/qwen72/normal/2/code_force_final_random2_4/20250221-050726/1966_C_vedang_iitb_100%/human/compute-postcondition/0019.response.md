To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the statement:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `tc` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input.
   - `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement checks if `mexsize` is even (`mexsize % 2 == 0`).
   - If `mexsize` is even, it prints 'Alice'.
   - If `mexsize` is odd, it prints 'Bob'.

4. **Determine the Value of `mexsize`:**
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - Since `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, it means `mexsize` is the next integer after `maxsize`.
   - For example, if `maxsize` is 5, then `mexsize` would be 6.

5. **Check the Parity of `mexsize`:**
   - Since `mexsize` is the next integer after `maxsize`, and `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list, `mexsize` will always be one more than `maxsize`.
   - Therefore, if `maxsize` is even, `mexsize` will be odd.
   - If `maxsize` is odd, `mexsize` will be even.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `mexsize` is the next integer after `maxsize`, and `maxsize` is an integer, `mexsize` will be even if `maxsize` is odd, and odd if `maxsize` is even.
   - Given that `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, and `maxsize` is an integer, `mexsize` will always be even because it is the next integer after `maxsize`.

Therefore, the `print` statement will always print 'Alice' because `mexsize` is even.

Output: **Alice**
