The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range limit `3`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` being less than `3`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1 to become 1, and it must still be less than 3.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `lex` is the last input integer processed, `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, `temp` is now a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[1][0] + 96`.**
