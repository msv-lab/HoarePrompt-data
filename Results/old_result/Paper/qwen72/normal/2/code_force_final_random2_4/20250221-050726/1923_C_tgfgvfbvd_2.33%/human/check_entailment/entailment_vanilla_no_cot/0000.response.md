Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix sums of the array `c` and stores them in the list `p`. This allows for efficient computation of the sum of any subarray using the formula `s = p[b-1] - p[a-2]` (or just `p[b-1]` if `a == 1`).

2. **Query Handling**: For each query, the program:
   - Computes the sum of the subarray `c[l_i]` to `c[r_i]` using the prefix sums.
   - Checks if the length of the subarray is greater than 1 (`b - a + 1 > 1`).
   - Ensures that the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray (`s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`).

3. **Conditions for a Good Subarray**:
   - The subarray must have a length greater than 1 to ensure that there is at least one element that can be changed to satisfy `a_i \neq b_i`.
   - The sum of the subarray must be at least twice the length of the subarray to ensure that there is enough "slack" to create a different array `b` with the same sum where all elements are positive and different from the corresponding elements in `a`.

Given these points, the program correctly determines whether each subarray is good and prints the appropriate response for each query. Therefore, the program is correct.
