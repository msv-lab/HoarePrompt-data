The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `numero_testes`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `numero_testes`. For the loop to execute, `numero_testes` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be initialized or adjusted.

State: **`numero_testes` must be greater than 0**
