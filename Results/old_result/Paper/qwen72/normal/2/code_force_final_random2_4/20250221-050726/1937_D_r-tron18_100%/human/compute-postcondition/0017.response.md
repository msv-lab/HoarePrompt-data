The code snippet `oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)` modifies the value of `oneInd`. Initially, `oneInd` is set to `func_1(preOne, 0) + func_1(preOne, 1)`. After executing the given line of code, `oneInd` is reduced by the value of `func_1(preOne, 1)`. Therefore, the new value of `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0)`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the last character of `s1` and `el` is '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1 (which is 0), `ol` is greater than `zr`, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 0)`**.
