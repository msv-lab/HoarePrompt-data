Output State: **`ii` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `r` is now `a[0] + 0 // 1`, `rem` is `0 % 1`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `i` is 0, and the condition `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) > 0` holds true, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
