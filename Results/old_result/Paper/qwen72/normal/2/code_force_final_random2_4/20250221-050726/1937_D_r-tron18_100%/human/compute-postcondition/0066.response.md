Output State: **`el` is the third-to-last character of `s1`, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`**.

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value `2 * suffZero[-1]` to the variable `zeroInd`. The values of `el`, `i`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged from their initial state.
