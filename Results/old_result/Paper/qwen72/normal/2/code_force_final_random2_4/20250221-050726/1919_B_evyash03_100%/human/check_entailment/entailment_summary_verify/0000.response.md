Reasoning: The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not implement the algorithm as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` indeed calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string, but it does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. The problem requires a more sophisticated approach to determine the best way to split the array such that the total penalty is minimized. The provided function simply returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which does not align with the required logic for calculating the minimum penalty.

For instance, in the example provided:
```
6
+-+-+-
```
The correct output should be `0` because the array can be split into `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])`, and the penalty for each subarray is `0`. However, the provided program will output `6` because it calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is `|3 - 3| = 0`, and then multiplies it by the length of the string, resulting in `6`.

This discrepancy confirms that the program does not solve the problem as intended, and the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
