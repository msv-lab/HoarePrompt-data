Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations without breaking, meaning for every tuple `(a3, l3)` in `val`, `l3` was equal to `[i for i in l if i != a3]`. The final state is that `t` is 0, indicating all test cases have been processed. For each test case, `m` is greater than 2, `val` contains `m-2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, and the program prints 'yes' for each test case. All other variables (`_`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`) retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop for each test case.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, all test cases have been processed (`t` is 0). For each test case, the loop has verified that the lists `l3` match the expected lists derived from `l` for all iterations, and the program has printed 'yes' for each test case. The variables used within the loop retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop for each test case.
