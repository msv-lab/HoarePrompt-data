Output State: **`el` is the third-to-last character of `s1`, `i` is `n - 3`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `ans[i]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans[i]` is updated to the result of the expression `zeroInd - oneInd`.
- `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`.
- `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.
- The index `i` is `n - 3`.
- All other variables (`el`, `i`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
