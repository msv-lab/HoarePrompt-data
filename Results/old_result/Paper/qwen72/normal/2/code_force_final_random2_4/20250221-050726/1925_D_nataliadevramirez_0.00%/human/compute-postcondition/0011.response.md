The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the range defined by `t`. The loop can execute as long as there are iterations left in the range defined by `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, indicating that the loop has executed at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0, and the variable `_` will increment by 1.

However, since `_` is not used in the loop (it's a throwaway variable), its value does not affect the loop's execution. The key factor is `t`, which must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**
