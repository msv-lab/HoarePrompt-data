The only object in the loop head is the variable `res` and the list `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, there needs to be another element in `results` for `res` to take as its value.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a non-empty list. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least one more element left to iterate over.

State: **`results` must be a list with at least one element remaining to iterate over**
