Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`, `shapes` is the total number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, `ln`:** These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`palka`:** This is the input list of integers and remains unchanged.
- **`pl`:** After the loop completes, `pl` contains all unique elements from `palka`. Each element from `palka` is added to `pl` only once, ensuring no duplicates.
- **`d`:** The dictionary `d` keeps track of the frequency of each element in `palka`. For each element `i` in `palka`, if it is not already in `d`, it is added with a count of 1. If it is already in `d`, its count is incremented by 1.
- **`shapes`:** This variable is calculated based on the final state of `pl` and `d`. It represents the total number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`. This value is determined by checking the counts in `d` for elements in `pl`.
