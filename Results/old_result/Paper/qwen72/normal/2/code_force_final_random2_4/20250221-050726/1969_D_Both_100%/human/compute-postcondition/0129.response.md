The only variable in the loop head is `test_cases`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, and `_` is `k-1`.

At the start of the next iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1, so it will be `k`. For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` tuples from `combined` (if `combined` had at least `k` elements), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is the final profit calculated after processing all elements in `combined`, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit observed during the loop execution.**
