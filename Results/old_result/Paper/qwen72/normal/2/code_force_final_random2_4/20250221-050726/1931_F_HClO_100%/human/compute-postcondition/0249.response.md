The provided Python code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'no'`.

Given the initial state:
- `m` is greater than 2.
- `val` contains `m-2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` from each iteration.
- `a3` and `l3` are the next tuple in `val`.
- `val` is no longer an empty list but contains `m-2` elements.

However, the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables or objects. It simply prints the string `'no'`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **no**
