The code snippet `op ^= val >> i & 1` performs a bitwise operation. Here's the step-by-step impact:

1. **`val`**: This is the second element in the list `a`.
2. **`i`**: This is an index used for bit shifting, but its value is not specified in the initial state.
3. **`op`**: This variable is updated using the XOR (`^`) operation with the result of `val >> i & 1`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
- **`val >> i`**: This shifts the bits of `val` to the right by `i` positions.
- **`val >> i & 1`**: This extracts the least significant bit (LSB) of the shifted value.
- **`op ^= val >> i & 1`**: This updates `op` by performing an XOR operation with the extracted bit.

### Impact on Variables:
- **`a`**: Remains unchanged.
- **`val`**: Remains the second element in `a`.
- **`i`**: Remains unchanged.
- **`op`**: Updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.

### Output State:
The list `a` remains a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 2 elements. `val` is still the second element in `a`. `i` remains unchanged. `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 2 elements. `val` is the second element in `a`. `i` remains unchanged. `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.**
