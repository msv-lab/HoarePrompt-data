To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `_` is 2 (this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is a new input integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
   - `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.
   - `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the list `a`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t` is an input integer, but it is not used in the code snippet.
   - `n` is another input integer, which represents the length of the list `a`.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. This formula finds the index of the middle element in the list `a` if `n` is odd, or the index just before the middle if `n` is even.
   - `res` is the count of how many times the element at index `p` appears in the list `a`.

3. **Execution of the Code:**
   - The `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`, which is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the list `a`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - Since `a` is a sorted list, the element at index `p` is one of the elements in the list. The value of `res` will be the count of this specific element in the list `a`.

Therefore, the output will be the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the list `a`.

Output: **res (where res is the number of times the element at index p appears in the list a)**
