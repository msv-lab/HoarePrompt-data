Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples containing at least three tuples (n, m, k, a, b), `results` is a list containing the string 'YES', `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. If `total_distinct` is less than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration or statement.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `unique_a = set(a)` updates the value of `unique_a` to be a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `cases`, `results`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `only_a`, `only_b`, `both`, `total_distinct`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `If total_distinct is less than k, the program continues to the next iteration or statement` remains valid and unchanged.
