Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 3`, `y + 3 < n`, `b` is `l[y + 3]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `l[x]` to `b`. Since `x` is defined as `y + 3`, `b` is now equal to the element in the list `l` at the index `y + 3`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
