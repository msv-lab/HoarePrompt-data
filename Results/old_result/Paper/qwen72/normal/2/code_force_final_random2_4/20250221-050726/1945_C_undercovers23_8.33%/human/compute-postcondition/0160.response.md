Output State: **`mini` is 100000000, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If the length of `final` is 0, `final` is updated to contain exactly one element: either `0` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or `n` otherwise. `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `lst` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `zero` is 1 or 0, `one` is 0 or 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `i` is 0, and depending on the character at index `i` in `s`, `zero` is set to 1 and `one` is set to 0 if the character is '0', or vice versa.
- The code calculates `zero_perc` as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.
- Since `i` is 0, the denominator `(i + 1)` is 1, so `zero_perc` is simply `math.ceil(zero * 100)`.
- If `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(1 * 100) = 100`.
- If `zero` is 0, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(0 * 100) = 0`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
