Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program fails to handle certain cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not always ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, especially when `k` is large and `n` is relatively small.

Consider the following test case:
```
n = 10
k = 5
```

Expected output:
```
YES
5
2 2 2 2 2
```

However, the program outputs:
```
NO
```

This is incorrect because Bob can set up 5 stalls, each with a price of 2 coins, and Alice will buy exactly 5 jewels (one from each stall).

The program's logic is flawed in the following ways:
1. It only considers a few specific cases (e.g., `n < k`, `n == k`, and `k - 1 < n - k + 1`), but it does not handle the general case where `k` can be any value between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
2. It does not consider the possibility of setting up more than 2 stalls to achieve the desired result.

To fix this, the program should consider a more general approach to ensure that Bob can always set up the necessary stalls to make Alice buy exactly `k` jewels, as long as it is possible within the constraints.
