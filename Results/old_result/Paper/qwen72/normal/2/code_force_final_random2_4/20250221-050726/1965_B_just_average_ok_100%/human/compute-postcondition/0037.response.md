The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums` and the value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `len(nums)` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `len(nums)` must still be greater than 2 for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), `i` is 2, `len(nums)` is greater than 2, `idx` remains -1 unless `nums[1]` was greater than `k` in which case `idx` is set to 0 and the loop would break.**
