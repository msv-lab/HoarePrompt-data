Postcondition: ***`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` contains the `k` tuples with the highest second elements from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, but now it is `len(combined) - k` elements shorter.***
