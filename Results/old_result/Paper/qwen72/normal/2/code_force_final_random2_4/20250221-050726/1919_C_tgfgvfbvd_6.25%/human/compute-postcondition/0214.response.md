Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index where the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element is found, or `y` is `n-1` if no such element exists, `a` is the last element in `l` that is less than or equal to all elements from `l[y+1]` to `l[n-1]`, `b` is the last element in `l` that is greater than or equal to all elements from `l[y+1]` to `l[n-1]`, and `c` is the count of elements in `l` from `l[y+1]` to `l[n-1]` that are greater than both `a` and `b` when they were initially set.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `a` will hold the smallest value encountered in the sublist `l[y+1:n]`.
- The variable `b` will hold the largest value encountered in the sublist `l[y+1:n]`.
- The variable `c` will count how many times an element in the sublist `l[y+1:n]` was greater than both `a` and `b` during the loop's execution.
