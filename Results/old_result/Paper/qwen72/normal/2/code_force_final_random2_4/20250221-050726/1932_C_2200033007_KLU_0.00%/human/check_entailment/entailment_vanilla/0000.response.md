### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for processing the commands and generating the required output.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements removed from the array `a` based on the commands.
   - It uses two pointers `l` and `r` to keep track of the leftmost and rightmost indices of the array `a`.

3. **Processing Commands**:
   - For each command in the string `s`, it checks if the command is 'L' or 'R'.
   - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of `a` to `b` and increments `l`.
   - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of `a` to `b` and decrements `r`.

4. **Calculating the Product**:
   - After processing all commands, the function initializes `p` to 1.
   - It iterates over the elements in `b` in reverse order, multiplying `p` by each element and appending the result to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the reversed `ans` to match the order of the commands.

5. **Output**:
   - The main loop prints the results for each test case using the `print` function with the `*` operator to unpack the list returned by `func_1`.

### Issues:
- **Product Calculation**: The program calculates the product of the elements in `b` but does not take the modulus `m` at each step. This can lead to overflow issues for large products, especially since the product can grow very large before being taken modulo `m`.

### Corrected Code:
To ensure the product is taken modulo `m` at each step, the product calculation should be modified as follows:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = (p * v) % m
        ans.append(p)
    return reversed(ans)
```

### Final Correctness:
- **Correctness**: **False**

The original program does not correctly handle the modulus operation during the product calculation, which can lead to incorrect results. The corrected code ensures that the product is taken modulo `m` at each step, making the solution correct.
