Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least one element, `pl` is a list containing `i`, `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` is None, then `d[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1. `shapes` is the total number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`. `i` is now in `pl`.**
