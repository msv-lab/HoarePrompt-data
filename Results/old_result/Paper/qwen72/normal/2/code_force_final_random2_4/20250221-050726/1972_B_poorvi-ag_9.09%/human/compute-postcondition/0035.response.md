The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `results`. If there are more elements in `results`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list of length `t` and contains at least two elements, and `i` is the next element in `results`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one more element after the current `i`. Since `results` contains at least two elements, after the last iteration, it still has at least one more element left to iterate over.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be the next (subsequent) element in `results`.
- `results` must still contain at least one more element.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is the subsequent element in `results`, `n` is the last input integer, `arr` is the last input string, `results` is a list of length `t` and contains at least one more element**
