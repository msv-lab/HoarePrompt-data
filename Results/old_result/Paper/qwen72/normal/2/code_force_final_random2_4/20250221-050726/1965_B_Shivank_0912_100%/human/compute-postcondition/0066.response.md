The code snippet `ans.append(1 << j)` appends the value of `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is at least 2
- `tc` is 2
- `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\)
- `j` is 1
- `n` is the first input integer
- `k` is the second input integer
- `ans` contains the initial elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` followed by the powers of 2 from `1 << 1` to `1 << 19`. If `j` is not equal to `i`, the list `ans` additionally includes `1 << j` which is `1`.

Since `j` is 1, `1 << j` evaluates to `1 << 1`, which is 2. This value is appended to the list `ans`.

Therefore, the updated list `ans` will include the additional element `2`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 2, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\), `j` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, and the list `ans` contains the initial elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` followed by the powers of 2 from `1 << 1` to `1 << 19` and an additional element `2`.**
