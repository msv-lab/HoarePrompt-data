To determine what will be printed by the `print(suma)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
   - `numCases` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `numInteger` is an input integer.
   - `numbers` is an empty list.
   - `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers` until the list is empty.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `numbers` is initially an empty list.
   - The variable `suma` is described as the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers` until the list is empty.
   - Since `numbers` is empty, there are no pairs of integers to remove, and thus no minimum values to sum.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `numbers` is empty, the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers` will be 0.

Therefore, the `print(suma)` statement will print the value of `suma`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
