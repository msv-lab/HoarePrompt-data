Output State: **_ is 0, `n` is the input positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, and `mak` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`. If no user input was `<`, `mak` remains 0.**

### Explanation:
- **_**: Remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **n**: Stays the same as the input positive integer because it is not modified within the loop.
- **i**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`.
- **mak**: This variable is updated to the value of `i` whenever the user input is `<`. If the user input is never `<`, `mak` remains 0. If the user input is `<` at any point, `mak` will be the last value of `i` for which the input was `<`.
