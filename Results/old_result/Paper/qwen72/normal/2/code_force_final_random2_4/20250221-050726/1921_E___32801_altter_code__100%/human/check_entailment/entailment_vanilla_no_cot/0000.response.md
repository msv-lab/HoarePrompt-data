Correctness: **False**

The program provided has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are some key points:

1. **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1()` is called inside a loop, but the function itself is defined after the loop. This will cause a `NameError` because the function is not defined when it is first called.

2. **Logical Errors**: The logic within the function `func_1()` is overly complex and contains several conditions that may not accurately reflect the rules of the game. For example, the way the program handles the movement of chips and the conditions for determining the winner or a draw are not straightforward and may lead to incorrect results.

3. **Simplification Needed**: The problem can be solved with a simpler approach. The key is to understand the relative positions of Alice's and Bob's chips and how they can move. Specifically, the parity of the difference in their row positions (`x2 - x1`) is crucial in determining the outcome.

Here is a simplified version of the solution that should work correctly:

```python
tt = int(input())
for _ in range(tt):
    n, m, x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
    
    # If Bob is already in the first row or Alice is in the last row, it's a draw
    if x1 == n or x2 == 1:
        print("Draw")
    # If the difference in rows is even, Alice can always win
    elif (x2 - x1) % 2 == 0:
        print("Alice")
    # If the difference in rows is odd, Bob can always win
    else:
        print("Bob")
```

This simplified version checks the following:
- If Alice is in the last row or Bob is in the first row, the game is a draw.
- If the difference in rows between Bob and Alice is even, Alice can always win.
- If the difference in rows is odd, Bob can always win.

This approach is more straightforward and aligns with the problem's constraints and requirements.
