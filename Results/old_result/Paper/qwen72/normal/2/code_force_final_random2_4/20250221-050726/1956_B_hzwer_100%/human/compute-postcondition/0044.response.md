Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, and `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to an integer input by the user, which must be at least 0. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `cnt`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. The new value of `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0.
