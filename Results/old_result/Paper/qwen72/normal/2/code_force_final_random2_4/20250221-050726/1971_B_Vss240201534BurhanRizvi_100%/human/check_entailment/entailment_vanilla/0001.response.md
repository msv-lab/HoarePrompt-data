### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Single Character Case**: If the length of the string `s` is 1, the program correctly prints "No" because it's impossible to rearrange a single character string to form a different string.

3. **All Characters Identical**: If all characters in the string `s` are the same (i.e., `len(set(s)) == 1`), the program correctly prints "No" because it's impossible to rearrange the string to form a different string.

4. **Random Rearrangement**: For other cases, the program uses `random.sample` to shuffle the characters of the string `s`. This is a valid approach to generate a random permutation of the string.

5. **Ensuring Different String**: After shuffling, the program checks if the shuffled string `s2` is the same as the original string `s`. If they are the same, it manually creates a different string by moving the first character to the end (`s2 = s[1:] + s[0]`). This ensures that the resulting string is different from the original string.

6. **Output**: The program correctly prints "Yes" followed by the rearranged string `s2`.

### Conclusion:
The program handles all edge cases correctly and follows the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
