Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code).
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. The expression `n if n - k <= 1 else 1` is a conditional expression (ternary operator).
2. It checks the condition `n - k <= 1`:
   - If the condition is true, it prints the value of `n`.
   - If the condition is false, it prints the value `1`.

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:
1. **Condition Check**: `n - k <= 1`
   - This condition evaluates whether the difference between `n` and `k` is less than or equal to 1.
2. **Result**:
   - If `n - k <= 1` is true, the value of `n` is printed.
   - If `n - k <= 1` is false, the value `1` is printed.

### Final Output:
- If `n - k <= 1`, the output will be `n`.
- Otherwise, the output will be `1`.

Output: **n if n - k <= 1 else 1 (where n and k are the input integers)**
