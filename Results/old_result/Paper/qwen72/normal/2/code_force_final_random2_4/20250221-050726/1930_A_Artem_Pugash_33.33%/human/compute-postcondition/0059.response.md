Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be equal to `t`, `i` is `t - 1`, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers` for each test case.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The total number of test cases remains unchanged as it was initially defined.
- **`numCases`**: After all iterations, `numCases` should be equal to `t`, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will be `t - 1` after the last iteration, since the loop runs from `0` to `t - 1`.
- **`numInteger`**: This is an input integer for each test case and is read inside the loop, so it will be the value of the last test case processed.
- **`numbers`**: After processing each test case, the `numbers` list is emptied, so it will be an empty list after the last test case.
- **`suma`**: For each test case, `suma` is calculated as the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers`. After all iterations, `suma` will hold the final result for the last test case processed.
