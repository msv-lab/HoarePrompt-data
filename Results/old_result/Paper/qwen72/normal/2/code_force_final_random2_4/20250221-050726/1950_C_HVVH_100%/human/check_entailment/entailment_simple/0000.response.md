Reasoning:  
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it splits the input string into hours and minutes.
- It handles the conversion from 24-hour to 12-hour format correctly:
  - If the hour is 0, it converts it to 12 and sets the period to 'AM'.
  - If the hour is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from the hour and sets the period to 'PM'.
  - If the hour is exactly 12, it sets the period to 'PM'.
  - For all other hours (1 to 11), it keeps the hour as is and sets the period to 'AM'.
- The program formats the output correctly, ensuring that both hours and minutes are zero-padded to two digits.
- The program correctly prints the time in the required 12-hour format followed by 'AM' or 'PM'.

Correctness: **True**
