The function `func_1` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided code snippet. However, based on the parameter constraints given, it is implied that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100 and consist only of digits from 1 to 9.

Since the output is not specified in the provided information, I cannot determine the exact return value of the function. However, based on the typical structure of such functions, it is likely that the function performs some operation using `t`, `x`, and `y` and returns a result based on that operation.

Given the lack of specific output details, I will describe the functionality based on the parameters:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 1000), `x` (a string representing an integer between 1 and 10^100, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9), and `y` (a string representing an integer between 1 and 10^100, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9). The function's return value is not specified, but it is expected to perform some operation using these parameters and return a result based on that operation.**
