The only variable in the loop head is `z`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `z` and the condition `z < t`. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is 0 and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `z` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `z`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where each `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` contain the respective appended values from the loop, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input, `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` before the loop terminates, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L <= 1`**
