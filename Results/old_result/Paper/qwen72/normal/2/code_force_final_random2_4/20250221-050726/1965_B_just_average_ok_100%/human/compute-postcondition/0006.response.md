Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) that must have at least 1 element, `idx` is -1, `i` is 0, `idx` is now -1, and the current value of `nums[i]` is greater than `k`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `i - 1` to `idx`. Since `i` is 0, `idx` becomes -1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of `nums[i]` is greater than `k` still holds true.
