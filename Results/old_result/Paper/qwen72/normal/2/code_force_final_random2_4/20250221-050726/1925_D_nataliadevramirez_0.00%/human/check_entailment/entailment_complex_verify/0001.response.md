Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for k excursions. The friendship value of a pair of friends increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if they are chosen again.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case provides the number of children (n), pairs of friends (m), and excursions (k).
   - For each pair of friends, the indices of the children and their initial friendship value are given.
   - The output should be the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (func_1)**:
     - This function calculates the expected value for a single test case.
     - It iterates over each friendship and calculates the contribution of each friendship to the total expected value.
     - The formula used is \( f \times \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \mod MOD \), which is the sum of the first k natural numbers multiplied by the initial friendship value.
     - This formula correctly captures the expected increase in friendship value over k excursions, assuming each pair of friends is chosen with equal probability.
   - **Function 2 (func_2)**:
     - This function handles multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
     - It prints the result for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The formula \( f \times \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \mod MOD \) correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for a single pair of friends over k excursions.
   - The function `func_1` correctly sums up the contributions of all pairs of friends.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.
   - The program handles edge cases such as when there are no pairs of friends (m = 0), where the expected value is 0, which is correctly handled by the formula.
   - The constraints are respected, and the code should handle large inputs efficiently.

5. **Annotated Code Verification**:
   - The annotations confirm that the program maintains the correct state and performs the necessary calculations accurately.
   - The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) ensures that the results fit within the required constraints and avoids overflow issues.

Given the above reasoning and verification, the provided program is correct and should produce the expected results for the given problem.

Final: **True**
