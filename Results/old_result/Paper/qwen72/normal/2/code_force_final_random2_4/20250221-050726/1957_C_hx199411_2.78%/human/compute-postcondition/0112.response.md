Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1.
- `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, with `k` being greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
- `i` is `k-1`.
- `c` and `r` are new integers input by the user.
- `num` is the total number of times `c` and `r` were compared, which is either `k` if `c == r` for all comparisons, or `2 * k` if `c != r` for all comparisons.
- `m` is `n - num`.
- `m` is not 0.
- The current value of `m` is 1, and the value of `m` remains unchanged.

Given this information, the print statement `print(1)` will simply print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
