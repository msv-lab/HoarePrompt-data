To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given Information:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is equal to `t`.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` in `cnt` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.
- `ans` is 0.

### Loop Head:
```python
for x in cnt:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements in the list `cnt`.
- For the loop to execute, `cnt` must be a non-empty list.

### States to Adjust:
- The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is `cnt`.

### Conditions:
- `cnt` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

### Initial State:
- `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- To ensure the loop executes, `cnt` must have at least one element. Since `n` is equal to `t` and `t` is a positive integer, `n` is also a positive integer. Therefore, `cnt` will always have at least one element (since its length is `n + 1`).

### Final State:
Since `cnt` is guaranteed to have at least one element (as `n` is a positive integer), no further adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` in `cnt` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `ans` is 0**
