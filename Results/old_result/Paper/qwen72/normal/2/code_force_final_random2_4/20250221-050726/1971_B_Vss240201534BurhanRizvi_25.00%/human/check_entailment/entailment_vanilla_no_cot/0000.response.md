Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
While the program attempts to solve the problem, it has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. The output "Yes" and "No" should be case-insensitive, but the program outputs them in a specific case ("Yes" and "No"). This might not be an issue if the judge system is lenient with case sensitivity, but it's better to follow the problem statement strictly.

2. More importantly, the use of `random.sample` does not guarantee that the generated string `s2` will be different from `s`. If the string `s` consists of repeated characters (like "aaaaa"), there is a chance that `random.sample` could return the same string `s`, leading to an incorrect "No" output when a "Yes" output is possible.

3. The program does not handle the edge case where the string `s` has a length of 1, which should always result in a "No" output because it's impossible to rearrange a single character to form a different string.

To fix these issues, the program should ensure that it always finds a valid rearrangement if one exists, especially for strings with repeated characters. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            # Try to swap the last two characters
            s2 = s[:-2] + s[-1] + s[-2]
            if s2 != s:
                print('Yes')
                print(s2)
            else:
                # If the last two characters are the same, try swapping the first and last
                s2 = s[-1] + s[1:-1] + s[0]
                if s2 != s:
                    print('Yes')
                    print(s2)
                else:
                    print('No')

func()
```

This version ensures that a valid rearrangement is found if possible, and it handles the edge case where the string length is 1.
