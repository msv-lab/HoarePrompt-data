Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest City Costs**:
   - The program calculates the cost to travel to the closest city using the expression `v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)`. This is incorrect because the cost to travel to the closest city should always be 1 coin, regardless of the distance. The expression `v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)` can result in values other than 1, which is not correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Queries**:
   - The program uses a list `b` to store cumulative costs, but the way it is constructed and used is not clear and seems to be incorrect. The logic for calculating the minimum number of coins to travel between two cities is flawed. Specifically, the subtraction `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]` and `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` does not correctly reflect the minimum cost to travel between the cities.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when the cities are very close together or when the cities are far apart. The logic for determining the closest city and the cost to travel to it is not robust enough to handle all possible inputs.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```
The expected output is:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```
However, the program's logic for calculating the costs is incorrect, and it will likely produce different results. Specifically, the way it calculates the cumulative costs and the way it handles the queries is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
