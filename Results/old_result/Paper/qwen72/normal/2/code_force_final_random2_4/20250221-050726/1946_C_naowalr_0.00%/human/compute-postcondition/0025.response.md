Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where each `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` contain the respective appended values from the loop, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input, `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function.**

Explanation: The value of `L` is updated to 50001, which is the value of `x`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
