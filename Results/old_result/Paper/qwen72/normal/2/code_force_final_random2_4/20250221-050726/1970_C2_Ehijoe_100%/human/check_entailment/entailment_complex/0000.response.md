### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game is played on a tree with `n` nodes.
   - Each round starts with a stone on a specific node, which is considered activated.
   - Players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses the round.
   - The goal is to determine who wins each round if both players play optimally.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function checks if the starting node or any of its children (excluding the parent) have more than one connection.
     - If the starting node is a leaf node (i.e., it has only one connection to its parent), it returns `False`.
     - Otherwise, it recursively checks the same condition for all adjacent nodes that are not the parent.
     - The function returns `True` if any of these recursive calls return `False`, indicating that at least one adjacent node is not a leaf node.
     - This function effectively determines if the starting node can lead to a winning position for the first player (Ron).

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, identifies leaf nodes, and reads the starting node for the round.
     - It then calls `func_1` with the tree and the starting node.
     - Based on the result of `func_1`, it prints either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.
     - The logic is correct because:
       - If `func_1` returns `True`, it means there is at least one path where Ron can force a win.
       - If `func_1` returns `False`, it means all paths lead to a loss for Ron, and Hermione wins.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the starting node is a leaf node correctly.
   - The function also handles the case where the starting node has multiple children correctly.
   - The function correctly identifies the winner based on the optimal play strategy.

4. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the tree structure and the starting node.
   - The input and output handling is correct and matches the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
