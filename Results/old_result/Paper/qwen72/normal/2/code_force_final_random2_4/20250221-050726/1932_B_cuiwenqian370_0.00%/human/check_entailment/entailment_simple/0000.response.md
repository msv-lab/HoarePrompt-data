Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the year in which the nth sign will occur, considering that signs occur sequentially and the next sign can only start occurring after the previous one has occurred. However, the provided program does not solve this problem correctly. Instead, it seems to be attempting to solve a different problem related to a path with special characters ('@' and '*') and dynamic programming.

Here are the issues with the provided program:

1. **Misinterpretation of Input**: The function `func_2` reads the entire input and splits it into a list called `data`. It then processes this data to extract the number of test cases (`t`) and the number of signs (`n`) for each test case. However, the variable `path` is assigned a single string value from `data`, which should actually be a list of integers representing the periodicities of the signs. This misinterpretation leads to incorrect processing.

2. **Incorrect Functionality of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is designed to handle a path with special characters and uses dynamic programming to calculate a score based on these characters. This is completely unrelated to the problem of finding the year when the nth sign occurs. The function `func_1` does not use the periodicities of the signs at all, and its logic is entirely focused on a different problem.

3. **Output Mismatch**: The output of `func_1` is the maximum value from the `dp` array that is greater than negative infinity. This value does not correspond to the year in which the nth sign occurs, as required by the problem statement.

Given these issues, the provided program is not correct for solving the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
