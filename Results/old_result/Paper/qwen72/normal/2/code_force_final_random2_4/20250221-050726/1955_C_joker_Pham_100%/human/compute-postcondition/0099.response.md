Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, and `r` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` depending on the condition. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as it was before the if statement.***
