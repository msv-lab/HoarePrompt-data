The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the condition that `i` is less than or equal to `isqrt(x)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `isqrt(x)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer where x >= 1, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 2, `ans` is 1**
