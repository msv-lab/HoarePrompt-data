The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('Bob')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state provides several conditions and variables:
  - `t` is greater than 2.
  - `i` is 2.
  - `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input.
  - If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd.
  
- However, the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these conditions or variables. It simply prints the string `'Bob'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'Bob'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, and `b`.

Output: **Bob**
