Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, `sum_f` is `f + f`, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sum_f` is updated to `f + f` because the initial value of `sum_f` was `f`, and the code snippet adds `f` to `sum_f`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `j`, `a`, `b`, and `f`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
