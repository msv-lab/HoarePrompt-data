Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, and `i` is `n-1`. If `v` equals `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `v` is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`.
- The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, maintaining the condition 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4.
- The value of `i` remains `n-1`.
- If `v` equals `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
