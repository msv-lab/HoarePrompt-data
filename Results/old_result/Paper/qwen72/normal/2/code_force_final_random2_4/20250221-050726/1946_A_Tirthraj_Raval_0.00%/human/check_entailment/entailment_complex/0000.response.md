Reasoning:

The program's goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. However, the current implementation of the function `func` does not achieve this goal. Instead, it calculates and prints the count of the median element in the array. This is incorrect because:

1. **Objective Mismatch**: The function should calculate the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median, but it instead counts the occurrences of the current median.
2. **Logic Error**: To increase the median, the function needs to consider the elements around the median and determine the minimum number of increments required to make the median larger. Simply counting the median's occurrences does not address this requirement.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: `[2, 2, 8]`
  - Current median: 2
  - To increase the median, we need to increment one of the 2s to 3. The correct answer is 1, but the function outputs 2 (the count of 2s).

- **Test Case 2**: `[7, 3, 3, 1]`
  - Current median: 3
  - To increase the median, we need to increment one of the 3s to 4. The correct answer is 1, but the function outputs 2 (the count of 3s).

- **Test Case 3**: `[1000000000]`
  - Current median: 1000000000
  - Since there is only one element, no operations are needed. The correct answer is 0, but the function outputs 1 (the count of 1000000000).

- **Test Case 4**: `[5, 5, 5, 4, 5]`
  - Current median: 5
  - To increase the median, we need to increment one of the 5s to 6. The correct answer is 1, but the function outputs 3 (the count of 5s).

### Conclusion:
The function does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

Correctness: **False**
