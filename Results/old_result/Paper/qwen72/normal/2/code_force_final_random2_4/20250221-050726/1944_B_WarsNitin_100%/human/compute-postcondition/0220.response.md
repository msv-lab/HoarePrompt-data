Postcondition: ***`i` is the length of `l` minus 1, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the elements `b[n - 1]` and `b[n - 1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is 2 times the original value of `k` (or 2 times the original value of `k` minus 2 if `b[n - 2] == b[n - 1]`), `q` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `b` is a sorted sublist of `a` containing the first `n` elements, `c` is a sorted sublist of `a` containing the elements starting from the `n`-th element to the end, `req` is equal to the new value of `k`. If `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` followed by `b[n - 1]`. Otherwise, if `b[0] != b[1]`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b`, and if `b[0] == b[1]`, `l` remains an empty list.***
