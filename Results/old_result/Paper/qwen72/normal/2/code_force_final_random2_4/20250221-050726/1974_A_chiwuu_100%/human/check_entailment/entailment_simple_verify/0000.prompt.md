You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    2 0
    
    15 0
    
    8 2
    
    0 9

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)

            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, x and y are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = input().split()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = int(b)
        
        t = b
        
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2

            t = t // 2 + 1

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `t` will hold the final computed value for each iteration, which is updated based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, `t` starts as `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd. If `t1` (calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`) is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains the same. Otherwise, `t` is adjusted based on the difference `t2` (calculated as `a - t1`). If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`. If `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15 + 1`. The variables `a` and `b` are updated with each iteration to the next pair of integers read from the input. The loop will have processed `n` pairs of integers (`a`, `b`), and the final state of `t` will reflect the last computation performed in the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of screens required is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
2
```

The program incorrectly calculates the number of screens required. For the input `(1, 1)`, the program should output `1` because one 1x1 icon and one 2x2 icon can fit on a single screen. However, the program outputs `2`, indicating that it is not correctly handling the placement of icons.

The issue lies in the calculation of `t1` and the subsequent logic for adding additional screens. The program does not correctly account for the available space on the screen after placing the 2x2 icons, leading to an incorrect result.
