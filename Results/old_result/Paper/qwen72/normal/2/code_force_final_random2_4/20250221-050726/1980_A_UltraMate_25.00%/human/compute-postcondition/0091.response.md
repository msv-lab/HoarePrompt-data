Functionality: ** The function reads multiple sets of inputs and calculates the number of additional occurrences required for each character in 'ABCDEF' to appear at least `m` times in the input string `s`. It prints this number for each set of inputs. The function processes `t` test cases, where for each case, it takes two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it prints the calculated number for each test case. **
