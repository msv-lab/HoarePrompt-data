You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                (a[i], b[i]) = (b[i], a[i])
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            (a[i], b[i]) = (b[i], a[i])
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
    print()
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads two lines of input, each representing a string of digits (1 to 9), and processes them to ensure that the first string is lexicographically not smaller than the second string. It does this by swapping characters at corresponding positions if necessary. After processing, it prints the modified first string, followed by an empty line, and then the modified second string. The function does not return any value. The input parameter `t` is mentioned in the comments but is not used in the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the product of two numbers `x` and `y` by swapping their corresponding digits any number of times. The numbers are given as strings of digits from 1 to 9.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads two strings `a` and `b` representing the numbers `x` and `y`.
   - It initializes a flag `f` to 0, which is used to track whether a swap has been made.
   - The loop iterates over each digit position `i` in the strings `a` and `b`.
     - If `f` is 0 (no swap has been made yet), it checks if `a[i] < b[i]`. If true, it swaps `a[i]` and `b[i]` and sets `f` to 1.
     - If `a[i] > b[i]`, it sets `f` to 1 to indicate that no further swaps are needed at this position.
   - After the initial swap (if any), it continues to check if `a[i] > b[i]` and swaps them if necessary.
   - Finally, it prints the modified strings `a` and `b`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic ensures that the first swap is made to maximize the leading digits, which is a good strategy to maximize the product.
   - Subsequent swaps ensure that the digits are in a non-decreasing order, which helps in maximizing the product.
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by reading the number of test cases `t` and calling `func_1()` for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where the numbers have different digits but are of the same length.
   - It also handles cases where no swaps are needed (e.g., when the numbers are already in a form that maximizes the product).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
