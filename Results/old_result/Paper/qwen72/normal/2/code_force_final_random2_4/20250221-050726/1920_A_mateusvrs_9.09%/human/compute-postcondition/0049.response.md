Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` must contain all elements as initially defined, `bx` is less than `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `tmp` will have been incremented for each element in `cx` that satisfies the condition `bx <= i <= ax`. Therefore, `tmp` will hold the total count of such elements in `cx`.
