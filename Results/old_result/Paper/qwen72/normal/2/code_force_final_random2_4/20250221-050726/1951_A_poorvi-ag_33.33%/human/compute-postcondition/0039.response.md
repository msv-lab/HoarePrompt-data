To determine what will be printed by the `print(r)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed.
   - The current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range.
   - Each of these subfolders may contain `.html` files.
   - `t` is the total number of iterations and must be at least 1.
   - `i` is `t - 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is an input string.
   - `results` contains `t` elements, each of which is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions described in the initial state.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(r)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `r` is not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet.
   - However, based on the context, `r` is likely one of the elements in the `results` list.
   - Since `i` is `t - 1`, it suggests that `i` is the last index of the `results` list.
   - Therefore, `r` is likely `results[i]`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print(r)` statement will print the last element of the `results` list.
   - Each element in `results` is either 'yes' or 'no'.

Given this analysis, the output will be:

Output: **results[t - 1] (where results[t - 1] is either 'yes' or 'no')**
