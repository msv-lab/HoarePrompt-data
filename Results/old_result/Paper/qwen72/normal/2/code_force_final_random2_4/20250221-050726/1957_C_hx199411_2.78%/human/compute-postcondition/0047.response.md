The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should start from 0, as it is the initial value when iterating over `range(k)`.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `t` is `t - 1` (and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again), `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, `num` is 0, `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
