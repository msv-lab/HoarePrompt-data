Output State: **`_` is `m-2`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` will be set by the last tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing at least `m-2` tuples, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `m` is an input integer and is at least 3, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0. The sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`. The element at index `i + p1` in `l1` is equal to `a2`.**
