To determine what will be printed by the `print(max_profit)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relationships between the variables:

1. **`test_cases`**: Must be greater than 0.
2. **`_`**: Is `k-1`, where `k` must be greater than 0.
3. **`k`**: Must be greater than 0.
4. **`heap`**: Is a list containing the last `k` tuples from `combined` (if `combined` had at least `k` elements).
5. **`remaining_items`**: Is an empty list.
6. **`n` and `k`**: Are the values returned by `func_2()`.
7. **`prices`**: Is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
8. **`neg_prices`**: Is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`.
9. **`bonuses`**: Is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
10. **`combined`**: Is an empty list.
11. **`current_profit`**: Is the final profit calculated after processing all elements in `combined`.
12. **`max_profit`**: Is the maximum profit observed during the loop execution.

Given that `combined` is an empty list, it implies that no elements have been processed, and thus no profits have been calculated. Therefore, the `current_profit` and `max_profit` would both be initialized to some default value, typically 0, unless otherwise specified.

Since the initial state does not provide any specific values for `max_profit` other than it being the maximum profit observed during the loop execution, and since `combined` is empty, the loop would not have run, and `max_profit` would remain at its initial value.

Therefore, the output of the `print(max_profit)` statement will be:

Output: **0 (where max_profit is the maximum profit observed during the loop execution, and since combined is empty, max_profit remains at its initial value of 0)**
