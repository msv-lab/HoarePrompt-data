Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
2. `n` must be greater than 1.
3. `i` is 1.
4. `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new `s`.
5. `b` and `c` are undefined if the length of `a` is 1.
6. Otherwise, `b` is a string containing the characters from the new `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is a string containing the characters from the new `s` sorted in descending order.
7. If the new `s` is equal to `b`, then `s` remains unchanged.
8. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to `b`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the `print('YES')` statement:

- The `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print('YES')` statement is:

Output: **YES**
