You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if l == li:
        return 'yes'
    return 'no'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`. It checks if the list `l` can be transformed into a specific pattern where each element is derived from the minimum value in `l` plus a linear combination of `c` and `d`. If the sorted version of `l` matches this pattern, the function returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'. The function does not modify the original parameters but sorts the lists `l` and `li` internally.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if the given array `b` can form a progressive square with the given parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`.
   - A progressive square is constructed such that each element \( a_{i,j} \) is calculated as \( a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l` (the array of integers).
   - It first finds the minimum value `a` in the array `l`. This minimum value is assumed to be \( a_{1,1} \).
   - It then constructs a new list `li` by calculating the values of the progressive square using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + h \cdot d \) for all \( k \) and \( h \) in the range `[0, n)`.
   - Both the original list `l` and the constructed list `li` are sorted.
   - If the sorted lists `l` and `li` are equal, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

3. **Verification:**
   - The minimum value `a` is correctly identified as the starting point of the progressive square.
   - The construction of the list `li` using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + h \cdot d \) is correct.
   - Sorting both lists and comparing them ensures that the elements match in both frequency and value.
   - The logic correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It accurately checks if the given array can form a progressive square with the specified parameters.
