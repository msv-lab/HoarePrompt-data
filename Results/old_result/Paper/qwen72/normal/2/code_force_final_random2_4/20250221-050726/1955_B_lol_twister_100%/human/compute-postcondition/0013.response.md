The only variables in the loop head are `h` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `h` and `n`. If `h` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is 0, and `li` has a new element `a + k * c` appended to it. For the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still satisfy the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is 1, `li` has a new element `a + k * c` appended to it.**
