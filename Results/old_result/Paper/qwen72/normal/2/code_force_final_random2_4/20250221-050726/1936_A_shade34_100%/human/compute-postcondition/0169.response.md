Let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

- `_` is 1 (This variable is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is a new input positive integer greater than 0 (This variable is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is 0.
- `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is explicitly set to 0.
- `mak` and `mak2` are both described as the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`. Since `i` starts at 0 and no user inputs have been specified in the initial state, both `mak` and `mak2` are 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Substituting the values:
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `mak2` is 0 (repeated).

So, the print statement will output:
Output: **? 0 0 0 0**
