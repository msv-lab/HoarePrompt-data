Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is greater than 2.
- `val` contains `m-2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` from each iteration.
- The program prints 'yes'.
- `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user through `input()`.
- All other variables (`_`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`) retain their initial values.

Given this information, the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
