Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3. If `b[2]` is equal to `b[1]`, `ans1` now includes the element at index 2 of `b` and the element at index 2 of `b`. If `k` is -2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[2]` is not equal to `b[1]`, `l` now includes the element `b[2]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
