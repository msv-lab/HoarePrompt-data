Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is 2.
- `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `i` is 3.
- `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 3 to the end.
- `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`.
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.

The code snippet to analyze is:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'NO'`.
- The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it is a static string.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
