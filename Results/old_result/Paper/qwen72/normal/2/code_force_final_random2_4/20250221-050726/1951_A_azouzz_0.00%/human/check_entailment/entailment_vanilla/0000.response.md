### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description Mismatch**: The provided "Problem" and "Program" sections do not match. The "Problem" section describes a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` that generates files based on a range of folder names and checks for `.html` files. However, the "Program" section describes a different function `func_1` that processes a series of strings and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions.

2. **Functionality of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s`.
   - It counts the number of '1's in the string `s` and applies the following logic:
     - If the count of '1's is greater than 2 and even, it prints 'YES'.
     - If the count of '1's is greater than 2 and odd, or exactly 1, it prints 'NO'.
     - If the string contains the substring '11', it prints 'NO'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The logic implemented in `func_1` seems to be correct based on the conditions provided.
   - The conditions are mutually exclusive and cover all possible cases for the count of '1's and the presence of '11' in the string.

4. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - The output is printed correctly for each test case.

Given that the "Program" section does not match the "Problem" section, we can only evaluate the correctness of the provided `func_1` function based on its own logic and input/output handling.

### Conclusion:
The provided `func_1` function is correct based on the logic and input/output handling described.

Correctness: **True**
