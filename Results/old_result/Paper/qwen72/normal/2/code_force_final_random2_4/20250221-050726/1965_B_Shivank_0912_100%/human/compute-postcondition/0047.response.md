Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `i` is the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \), `j` is 19, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least \( 2^i \). The list `ans` contains the initial elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` followed by the powers of 2 from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19`, excluding `1 << i`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates 20 times, with `j` ranging from 0 to 19.
- For each iteration, if `j` is not equal to `i`, the value `1 << j` is appended to the list `ans`.
- Therefore, after all iterations, `ans` will contain the initial elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` followed by all powers of 2 from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19`, except for `1 << i`.
- The variables `t`, `tc`, `i`, `j`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
