Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer (converted from its original string value), `b` is an integer (unchanged from its original integer value). If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is updated to `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`, `t1` is updated to `t * 15 - b * 4`, and `t2` is updated to `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15 + 1`, `t1` is updated to `t * 15 - b * 4`, and `t2` is updated to `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`.***
