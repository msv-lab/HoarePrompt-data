The code snippet updates the value at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` in the list `permutation` to the current value of `curr_v`. Given the initial state, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` was previously set to `curr_v - 1`, and now it is updated to `curr_v`. The value of `curr_v` is increased by 1 after this assignment, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is also increased by `k`. However, since the code snippet only shows the assignment and not the increments, we only consider the assignment in the output state.

Output State: **`permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v`, `n` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `curr_v` is increased by 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is increased by `k`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k` must be less than `len(permutation)`**.
