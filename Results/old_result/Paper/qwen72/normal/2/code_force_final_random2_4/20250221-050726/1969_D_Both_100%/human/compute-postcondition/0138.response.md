The code snippet `combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))` creates a new list called `combined` by pairing elements from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`. Each element in `combined` is a tuple consisting of one element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`.

Given the initial state:
- `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`.
- `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.

The `zip` function pairs the elements of `neg_prices` and `bonuses` together, and the `list` function converts the result into a list of tuples.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0.**
