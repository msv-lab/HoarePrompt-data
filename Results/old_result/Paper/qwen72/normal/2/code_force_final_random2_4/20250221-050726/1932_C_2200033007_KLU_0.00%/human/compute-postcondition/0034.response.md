The value `p` is the product of the last element of `b` and itself. The list `ans` initially contains `[p * v, p]`. After executing the code snippet `ans.append(p)`, the value `p` is appended to the list `ans`.

Output State: **`b` is a list with at least 3 elements, `v` is the last element of `b`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing `[p * v, p, p]`, `p` is the product of the last element of `b` and itself, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`**.
