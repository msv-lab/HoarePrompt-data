You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, which determines the size of the checkerboard to be generated. The function should read the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 20) from the input, followed by `t` lines, each containing a single integer `n`.
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')
            print('##..')
            print('..##')
            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')
        
    #State: `c` is `casos - 1`, `casos` is the number of test cases provided by the user, and `n` is the last input integer provided by the user. If the last input `n` is 1, the current value of `n` is 1. If the last input `n` is 2, the current value of `n` is 2. If the last input `n` is 3, the current value of `n` is 3. If the last input `n` is 4, the current value of `n` remains 4. If the last input `n` is not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4, the value of `n` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the size of a checkerboard. It then generates a checkerboard of size `n x n` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
