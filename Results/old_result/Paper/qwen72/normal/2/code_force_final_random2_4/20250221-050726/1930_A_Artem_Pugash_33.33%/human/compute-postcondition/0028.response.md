Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the input values in ascending order (with the first two elements removed), `suma` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the second element that was removed from `numbers`.** 

Explanation: The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` removes the first element from the `numbers` list and converts it to an integer, assigning this value to `b`. Since the `numbers` list was already missing its first element (which was assigned to `a`), this operation now removes the second element from the original list. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
