The only objects in the loop head are the variable `elem` and the list `lst`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `lst` after the current `elem`.

At the end of the last iteration, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`, `lst` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `lst`, and `final` is an empty list unless the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, in which case `final` is a list containing `[elem]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must contain at least two elements, and `elem` will be the second element in `lst`.

State: **`mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`, `lst` must contain at least two elements, `elem` is the second element in `lst`, `final` is an empty list unless the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in `lst` is equal to `mini`, in which case `final` is a list containing `[first element in lst]`**
