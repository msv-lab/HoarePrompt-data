Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer where x >= 1, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 3, and `ans` is 1. If `x % i == 0` (i.e., `x` is divisible by 3), and if `n` <= `x // 3`, `ans` is set to 2. If `n` is greater than `x // 3` but `n` <= 2, `ans` is set to the maximum of 1 and `x // 3`. If `n` <= 3, `ans` is set to the maximum of 1 and `x // 3`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.***
