Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

# Annotated Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and there are two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}...a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}...a_{2n}, each of length n, consisting of 0s and 1s. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, the loop has completed its execution.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is either the string formed by concatenating the substring of `a[0]` up to the position where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met with the rest of `a[1]`, or it is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]` if the condition is never met, `x` is the index where the condition is met or `n-1` if the condition is never met.

    #State: If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `t` remains 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is a string formed based on certain conditions, `x` is the index where the condition is met or `n-1` if the condition is never met, and `i` is `x-1`. If the loop breaks before completing all iterations, `t` is updated to `x - i + 1` where `i` is the index at which the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]` is met, and `i` is the index at which the loop broke.

    #This is printed: s (where s is the string formed based on the conditions described in the initial state)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1 (if the loop completes all iterations) or x - i + 1 (if the loop breaks at some index i, where x is the index where the condition is met or n-1 if the condition is never met, and i is the index at which the loop broke)
