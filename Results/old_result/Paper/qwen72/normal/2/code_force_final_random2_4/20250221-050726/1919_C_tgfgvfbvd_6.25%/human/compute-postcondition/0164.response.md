Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index where the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element is found, or `y` is `n-1` if no such element exists, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is the value of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or 0 if no such element exists, and `c` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates through the list `l` starting from the second element (index 1) up to the last element (index `n-1`).
- During each iteration, it checks if the current element `l[y]` is greater than the previous element `l[y-1]`.
- If such an element is found, `b` is updated to this element's value, and the loop breaks immediately.
- If no such element is found throughout the entire list, `b` remains 0, and `y` will be `n-1` (the last index checked).
- The variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `a`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
