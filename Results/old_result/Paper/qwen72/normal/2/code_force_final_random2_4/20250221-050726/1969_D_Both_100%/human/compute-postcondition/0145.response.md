The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` performs two actions:
1. It removes the last element from the list `combined` using `pop()`.
2. It pushes the removed element into the heap `heap` using `heappush`.

Given the initial state:
- `k` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 1.
- If `combined` is true, `combined` is a list with one less element, and `heap` contains one additional element.

After executing the code:
- The last element of `combined` is removed, so `combined` now has one less element.
- The removed element is added to `heap`, so `heap` now contains one additional element.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `combined` is a list with one less element, and `heap` contains one additional element.**
