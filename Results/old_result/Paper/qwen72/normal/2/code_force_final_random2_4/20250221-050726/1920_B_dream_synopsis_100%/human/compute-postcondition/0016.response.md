The code snippet updates the value of `sums` by adding the element at index `i - 1` from the list `a` to it. Let's break down the impact:

- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an integer provided by the user input
- `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 0
- `x` is an integer provided by the user input
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `ans` is an empty list
- `i` is not 0
- `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`

After executing the code snippet:
- `sums` is now `sums + a[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 0, `x` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is not 0, `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
