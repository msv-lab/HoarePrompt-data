### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `cx` is initialized as an empty set to store the values of `k` that should not be equal to any value in this set.
   - `ax` is initialized to a very large number (`1000000000 + 7`) to represent the upper bound of `k`.
   - `bx` is initialized to `-1` to represent the lower bound of `k`.

3. **Processing Constraints**:
   - The function correctly processes each constraint:
     - If `a == 1`, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`, ensuring `k` is at least `x`.
     - If `a == 2`, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`, ensuring `k` is at most `x`.
     - If `a == 3`, it adds `x` to the set `cx`, ensuring `k` is not equal to `x`.

4. **Validation**:
   - After processing all constraints, the function checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If so, it appends `0` to the result list `r` because no `k` can satisfy the constraints.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the number of invalid values in `cx` from the total range `ax - bx + 1`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function correctly prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Bounds**: The bounds `bx` and `ax` are correctly updated to ensure they represent the minimum and maximum values `k` can take, respectively.
- **Handling Exclusions**: The set `cx` correctly stores the values that `k` cannot be, and the function correctly subtracts these from the total range.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases where the range is invalid (i.e., `bx >= ax`) by appending `0` to the result list.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
