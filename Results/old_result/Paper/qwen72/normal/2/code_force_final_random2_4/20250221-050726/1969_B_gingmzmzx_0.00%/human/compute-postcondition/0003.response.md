The code snippet `zeroes = s.count(0)` counts the number of zeros in the list `s` and assigns this count to the variable `zeroes`.

- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `s` remains a list of integers representing the digits of the input binary string.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `zeroes` is now assigned the value of the count of zeros in the list `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input binary string, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`.**
