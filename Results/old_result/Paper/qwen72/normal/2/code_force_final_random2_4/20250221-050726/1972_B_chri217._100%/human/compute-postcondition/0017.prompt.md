You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and each (n, s) in cases is a tuple where n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and s is a string of length n containing only 'U' and 'D'.
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        
        cases.append((n, s))
        
    #State: `t` is an integer read from input, 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, each tuple is `(n, s)`, where `n` is an integer read from the corresponding line of input, and `s` is a string read from the corresponding line of input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. `_` is `t-1`.
    return cases
    #The program returns a list named `cases` containing `t` tuples, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100. Each tuple in the list is of the form `(n, s)`, where `n` is an integer read from the corresponding line of input, and `s` is a string read from the corresponding line of input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list named `cases` containing `t` tuples, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. Each tuple in the list is of the form `(n, s)`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U' and 'D', and has been stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list named `cases` containing `t` tuples, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100. Each tuple in the list is of the form `(n, s)`, where `n` is an integer read from the corresponding line of input, and `s` is a string read from the corresponding line of input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
