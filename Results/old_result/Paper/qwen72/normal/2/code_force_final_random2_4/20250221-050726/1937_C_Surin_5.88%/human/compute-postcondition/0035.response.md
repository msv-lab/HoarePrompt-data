Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` (which is `n-1`) if all inputs were `<`, otherwise `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, `prev` is 1, `i` is 1, `r` is `>`.** 

Explanation: The code `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to `prev`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `prev` is now 1, while the rest of the variables retain their initial values.
