The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the number of iterations based on the input. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer indicating the number of test cases. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input is a positive integer.

State: **The input must be a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `_` is 0**
