Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `s` is an input string. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1' character, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' and `b` remains an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1' character, `a` remains 0 and `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If the string `s` contains no '1' characters, `a` remains 0 and `b` remains an empty string.***
