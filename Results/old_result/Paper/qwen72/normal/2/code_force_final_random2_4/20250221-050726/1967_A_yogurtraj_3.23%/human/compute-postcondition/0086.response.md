Postcondition: ***`ii` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input. If `k` is not equal to 0, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `i` is `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking. If `k` is 0, `r` is the final value of `a[n-1]` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` depending on the condition, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` if the loop breaks, otherwise it remains 0, `y` is `n - 1 - i` if the loop breaks, otherwise it remains 0, and `i` is `n - 1` if the loop completes without breaking.***
