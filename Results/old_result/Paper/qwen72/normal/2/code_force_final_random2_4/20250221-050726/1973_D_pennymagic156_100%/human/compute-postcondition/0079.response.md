The function `func_2()` is called, but since there's no definition or description of what `func_2()` does, we cannot determine its exact impact on the program state. However, based on the initial state, we know that `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1` and that `l < n + 1`. Additionally, it is stated that `l` is equal to `n + 1`.

Given this information, calling `func_2()` does not change the value of `l` because it is already defined as `n + 1`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `v`, `i`, `cnt`) are not affected by the call to `func_2()`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the exception that `func_2()` has been called.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 3, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `n + 1`, and `func_2()` has been called.**
