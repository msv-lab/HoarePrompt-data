Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 3 elements. The first element of `a` is now `a[0] ^ a[1]`. `val` is the third element in `a`. `i` remains unchanged. `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. If `op` is 0 after the update, `t` is a list that now includes the value `0` and `ai` is 0. Otherwise, `t` and `ai` remain unchanged. `ai` is now `ai ^ val`. `t` is a list that now includes the value `ai`.**

Explanation:
- `a` remains a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 3 elements.
- The first element of `a` is `a[0] ^ a[1]`.
- `val` is the third element in `a`.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `op` is updated to `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.
- If `op` is 0 after the update, `t` is a list that now includes the value `0` and `ai` is set to 0. Otherwise, `t` and `ai` remain unchanged.
- `ai` is updated to `ai ^ val`.
- `t` is a list that now includes the value `ai`.
