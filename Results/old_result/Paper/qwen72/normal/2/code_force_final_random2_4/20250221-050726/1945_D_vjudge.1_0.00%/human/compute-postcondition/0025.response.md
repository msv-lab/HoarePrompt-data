The code snippet `soma_b += lista_B[i]` adds the value of `lista_B[i]` to the current value of `soma_b`. Given that `i` is 2, the third element of `lista_B` (since list indices start at 0) is added to `soma_b`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `soma_b` is updated to `soma_b + lista_B[2]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_B` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and `lista_B` is in its original order, `lista_A` is a list of integers provided by the user input and has been reversed, `n - k` must be greater than 2, the relationship between the first elements of `lista_A` and `lista_B` is preserved (either `lista_A[0] < lista_B[0]` or `lista_A[0] >= lista_B[0]`), `soma_b` is now `soma_b + lista_B[2]`.**
