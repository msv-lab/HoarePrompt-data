Output State: **_ is 0, `n` is the input positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the same as `mak`, `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<`.**

### Explanation:
- **_**: Remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **n**: Remains the input positive integer as it is not modified within the loop.
- **i**: After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
- **mak**: This variable stores the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`. If no such input was provided, `mak` remains 0.
- **mak2**: This variable is always the same as `mak` because it is not updated independently.
- **pans**: This list contains all values of `i` for which the user input was either `=` or `<`. If the user never inputs `<` or `=`, `pans` will be an empty list.
