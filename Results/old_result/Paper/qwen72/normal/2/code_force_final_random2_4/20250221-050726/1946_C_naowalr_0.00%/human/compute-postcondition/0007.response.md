Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where `adj[a]` now contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers.**

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` adds the integer `a` to the list `adj[b]`. This means that `adj[b]` now contains the value `[a]` in addition to any other elements it might have had. The other variables (`t`, `z`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
