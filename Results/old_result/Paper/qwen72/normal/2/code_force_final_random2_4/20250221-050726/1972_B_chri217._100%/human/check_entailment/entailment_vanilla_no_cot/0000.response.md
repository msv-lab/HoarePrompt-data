Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Input Reading (`func_1`)**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` in a list `cases`.

2. **Logic to Determine the Winner (`func_2`)**:
   - The function counts the number of facing-up coins (`ups`) in the string `s`.
   - It returns "YES" if the number of facing-up coins is odd, and "NO" if it is even.

The key insight here is that the game is determined by the parity of the number of facing-up coins:
- If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always make the first move and ensure that she leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob, forcing Bob into a losing position.
- If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that he leaves an odd number of facing-up coins for Alice, forcing Alice into a losing position.

Given this logic, the program correctly determines the winner for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
