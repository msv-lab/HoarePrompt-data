The function should accept multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins. The total number of test cases t is also provided, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
