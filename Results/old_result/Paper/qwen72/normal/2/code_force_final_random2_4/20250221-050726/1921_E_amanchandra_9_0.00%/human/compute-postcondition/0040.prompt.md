Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b where (1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9), representing the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b, ensuring the initial positions do not coincide.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb = map(int, input().split())
    if xa > xb:
        print('Draw')
    else:
        x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
        if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
            l = max(1, yb - x)
            r = min(w, yb + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r -
                ya) <= x + 1])
        else:
            l = max(1, ya - x)
            r = min(w, yb + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `xa` is an input integer, `ya` is an input integer, `xb` is an input integer, `yb` is an input integer. If `xa` > `xb`, no changes are made to the variables. If `xa` ≤ `xb`, `x` is set to `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `l` is set to `max(1, yb - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, yb + x)`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, `l` is set to `max(1, ya - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, yb + x)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 1, `h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `xa` is an input integer, `ya` is an input integer, `xb` is an input integer, `yb` is an input integer. If `xa > xb`, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, `x` is set to `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`. If `abs(xa - xb)` is odd, then `l` is set to `max(1, yb - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, yb + x)`. If `abs(xa - xb)` is even, then `l` is set to `max(1, ya - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, yb + x)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 2, `h` is the new input integer, `w` is the new input integer, `xa` is the new input integer, `ya` is the new input integer, `xb` is the new input integer, `yb` is the new input integer. If `xa > xb`, no changes are made. Otherwise, `x` is set to `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`. If `abs(xa - xb)` is odd, `l` is set to `max(1, yb - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, yb + x)`. If `abs(xa - xb)` is even, `l` is set to `max(1, ya - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, yb + x)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
