To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions in the `print` statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `i` is 1.
- `h` is an input integer.
- `w` is an input integer.
- `xa` is an input integer.
- `ya` is an input integer.
- `xb` is an input integer.
- `yb` is an input integer.
- `x` is calculated as `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`.
- `l` is calculated as `max(1, yb - x)`.
- `r` is calculated as `min(w, yb + x)`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `x`:**
   - `x = (abs(xa - xb) // 2)`

2. **Calculate `l`:**
   - `l = max(1, yb - x)`

3. **Calculate `r`:**
   - `r = min(w, yb + x)`

4. **Evaluate the Condition:**
   - The condition in the `print` statement is `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`.

5. **Determine the Output:**
   - If the condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` is true, the `print` statement will output `'Alice'`.
   - If the condition is false, the `print` statement will output `'Draw'`.

### Explanation:
- `x` is half the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`.
- `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`, ensuring `l` is at least 1.
- `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`, ensuring `r` does not exceed `w`.
- The condition checks if both `l` and `r` are within `x + 1` distance from `ya`.

### Final Output:
Based on the given initial state and the condition in the `print` statement, the output will be either `'Alice'` or `'Draw'` depending on the values of `l`, `r`, and `ya`.

Output: **'Alice' if `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` is true, otherwise 'Draw'**.
