Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1.** 

Explanation: The code snippet reads two integers from the input, assigning them to `n` and `t`. According to the problem description, `n` is an integer within the range [2, 200000], and `t` is explicitly stated to be 1. The other parts of the initial state, such as the edges of the tree and the starting node, are not affected by this code snippet.
