The code snippet `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` (which is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the original value of `ai` and `val`) to the list `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 1 element.
- `val` is the first element in `a`, which is now 0.
- `op` is updated by toggling its least significant bit based on the `i`-th bit of `val`, and the current value of `op` is 0.
- The element `ai` in the list `a` is now the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the original value of `ai` and `val`.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. **`ai`**: The value of `ai` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the original value of `ai` and `val`. Since `val` is 0, `ai` remains unchanged because `ai ^ 0 = ai`.
2. **`t`**: The list `t` is updated by appending the value of `ai` to it.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 1 element.
- `val` is the first element in `a`, which is 0.
- `op` is 0.
- `t` is a list that now contains the value of `ai`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 1 element. `val` is the first element in `a`, which is 0. `op` is 0. `t` is a list that now contains the value of `ai`.**
