Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the new user-provided integer, `k` is the new user-provided integer and must be non-negative, `x` is the new user-provided integer, `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k`, and `ans` is a list containing two elements. If `i` is 0, the first element of `ans` remains unchanged, and the second element is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0, the first element of `ans` remains unchanged, and the second element is the updated value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[k] - 2 * a[k + x]`. If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[k - 1]`.***
