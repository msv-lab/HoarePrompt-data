Output State: **`a` is an integer (converted from its original string value), `b` is an integer (unchanged from its original integer value), `t` is either `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`**.

Explanation:
- `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
- Since `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, substituting this into the equation for `t2` gives `t2 = a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`.
- The values of `a`, `b`, `t`, and `t1` remain unchanged from their initial state.
