Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    if k == 0:
        break
    if l == r:
        if k >= a[r]:
            sunks += 1
            break
        break
    if a[l] <= a[r]:
        if k >= a[l] * 2:
            k -= a[l] * 2
            a[r] -= a[l]
            if a[r] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
            continue
        elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break
    if k == 0:
        break
    if a[r] < a[l]:
        if k >= a[r] * 2:
            k -= a[r] * 2
            a[l] -= a[r]
            if a[l] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
            continue
        elif a[r] * 2 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, and `r` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` depending on the condition. `sunks` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `a[r] < a[l]`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[r]`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`, and if `a[l]` becomes 0, `l` is updated to either 1 or 2, and `sunks` is updated to either 2, 3, or 4. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k` is less than `2 * a[r]`, then `sunks` remains either 0, 1, or 2, `k` is set to 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, and `r` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` depending on the condition. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r] < a[l]`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, `r` is updated to either `n - 2`, `n - 3`, or `n - 4` depending on the condition, and `sunks` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` is 0, otherwise `sunks` remains unchanged. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is updated to either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r]` is not less than `a[l]`, the program continues without changing `r` or `sunks`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, and `r` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` depending on the initial condition. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k >= a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, `k` is updated to `k - a[r+1] * 2`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r+1]`, and if `a[l]` becomes 0, `sunks` is set to 1. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k < a[r] * 2` and `a[r] * 2 == k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k < a[r] * 2` and `a[r] * 2 != k`, `sunks` remains unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, `sunks` remains unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
