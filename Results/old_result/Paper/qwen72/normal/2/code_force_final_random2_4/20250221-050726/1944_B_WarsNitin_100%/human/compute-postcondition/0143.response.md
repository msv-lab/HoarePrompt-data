Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, and `k` is either -2 or 0. If `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `k` is -4, and `ans1` now includes the elements at index 2 and index 2 of `b`. The program does not break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[i] != b[i - 1]`, `l` is a list that now includes the element `b[2]` if `b[i] != b[i + 1]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` remains -2, and the program continues executing. If `b[i] == b[i + 1]`, the program continues executing without modifying `l` or `k`.***
