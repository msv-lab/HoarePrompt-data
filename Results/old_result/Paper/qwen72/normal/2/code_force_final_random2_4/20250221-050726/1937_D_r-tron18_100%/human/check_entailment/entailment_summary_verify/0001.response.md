### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to simulate the movement of a pinball on a one-dimensional grid represented by a string `s` of length `n`, where each character is either `<` or `>`.
   - The pinball moves according to the direction of the character in the current cell and the character is flipped after the pinball moves.
   - We need to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function calculates the difference between the last element of an array and the element at a specific index.
     - It is used to compute the positions and movements of the pinball.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function processes the string `s1` and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
     - It uses two lists, `pre` and `suffZero`, to keep track of the positions of `>` and `<` respectively.
     - It iterates through the string in reverse order, updating the positions and calculating the time for each cell.

3. **Key Points**:
   - **Preprocessing**:
     - `pre` stores the positions of `>` characters.
     - `preOne` is the prefix sum of `pre`.
     - `suffZero` keeps track of the cumulative positions of `<` characters from the end of the string.
   - **Time Calculation**:
     - For each cell, the function calculates the time based on the positions of `>` and `<` characters.
     - The logic involves checking the balance between the number of `>` and `<` characters and adjusting the time accordingly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when the string consists entirely of `>` or `<`.
   - It also handles the general case where the string has a mix of `>` and `<`.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The program processes each test case in linear time, making it efficient for large inputs.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - The function `func_1(arr, times)` correctly calculates the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
  - This function is used to help with the calculations in `func_2`.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - The function `func_2(s1, n)` correctly preprocesses the string `s1` to create the `pre` and `suffZero` arrays.
  - It iterates through the string in reverse order, updating the positions and calculating the time for each cell.
  - The logic for calculating the time is complex but appears to be correct based on the problem description and the function summary.
  - The use of prefix sums and suffix sums helps in efficiently calculating the time for each cell.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the movement of the pinball and the flipping of the characters in the grid as described. The use of prefix sums and suffix sums helps in efficiently calculating the time for each cell.
