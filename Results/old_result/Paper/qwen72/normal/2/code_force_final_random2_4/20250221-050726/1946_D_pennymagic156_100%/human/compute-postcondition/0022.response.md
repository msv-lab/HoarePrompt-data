The value of `ai` is updated by performing an XOR operation with `val`. Initially, `ai` is 0. After the operation, `ai` will be equal to `val`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers with the first element being 0, `val` is the second element of `a`, `op` is updated by toggling its least significant bit based on the result of `val >> i & 1`, `t` is a list containing [0], `ai` is equal to `val`.**
