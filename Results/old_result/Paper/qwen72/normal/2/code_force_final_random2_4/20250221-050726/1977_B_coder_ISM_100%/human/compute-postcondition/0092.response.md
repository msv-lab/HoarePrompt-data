The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limit, which is 30. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 30. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this increment in `i`.

State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `length` is 30, `i` is 1, and `s` is a list containing either '1' if the bitwise AND of `x` and `2^0` (which is 1) is non-zero, or '0' if the bit at position 0 in `x` is 0.**
