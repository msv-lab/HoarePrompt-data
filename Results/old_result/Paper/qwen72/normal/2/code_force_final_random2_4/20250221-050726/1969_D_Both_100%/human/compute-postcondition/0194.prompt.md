Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `prices` is a list of integers representing the prices Alice pays for the items, `bonuses` is a list of integers representing the bonuses Bob pays for the items, and both `prices` and `bonuses` have the same length `n`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(test_cases):
    heap = []
    remaining_items = []
    n, k = func_2()
    prices = list(func_2())
    neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]
    bonuses = list(func_2())
    max_profit = 0
    current_profit = 0
    combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))
    combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])
    for _ in range(k):
        if combined:
            heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())
    if combined:
        current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit
    while combined:
        item = combined.pop()
        if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
            current_profit -= item[1]
        else:
            current_profit += item[0]
        removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
        if removed_item:
            current_profit -= removed_item[0]
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
    print(max_profit)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` contains `k` tuples with the highest second elements from the original `combined` list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, and `max_profit` is the maximum value of `current_profit` observed during the loop execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` tuples from `combined` (if `combined` had at least `k` elements), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is the final profit calculated after processing all elements in `combined`, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit observed during the loop execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is 0, `_` is -1, `combined` is empty, `heap` contains all the elements that were originally in `combined`, sorted according to the second element of each tuple, `current_profit` is the final adjusted profit after processing all items in `combined`, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit encountered during the loop. `test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
