Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is 0.
- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `n` is not equal to 1.
- `n` is not equal to 2.
- The current value of `n` is 3.

The code snippet to analyze is:
```python
print('##..##')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints a fixed string `'##..##'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **##..##**
