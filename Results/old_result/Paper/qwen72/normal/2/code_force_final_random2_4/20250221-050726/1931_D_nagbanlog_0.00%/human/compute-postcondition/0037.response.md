Let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10,000.
- `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least one test case.
- `case` is the first test case in the `test_cases` list.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is the first element of `case['params']`.
- `x` is the second element of `case['params']`.
- `y` is the third element of `case['params']`.
- `a` is a list with at least 3 elements.
- `num` is the third element of `a`.
- `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
- `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.
- `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 1.
- `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.

Given these definitions, let's determine the values of the variables used in the `print` statement:

1. **`num`**: This is the third element of the list `a`.
2. **`mod_x`**: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
3. **`mod_y`**: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
4. **`required_mod_x`**: This is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
5. **`required_mod_y`**: This is simply `mod_y`.

Now, let's put it all together:

```python
print(
    f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```

### Explanation:
- **`Number: {num}`**: This will print the value of the third element in the list `a`.
- **`mod_x: {mod_x}`**: This will print the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
- **`mod_y: {mod_y}`**: This will print the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- **`required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}`**: This will print the result of `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- **`required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}`**: This will print the same value as `mod_y`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [(x - mod_x) % x], required_mod_y: [mod_y] (where num is the third element of the list a, mod_x is the remainder when num is divided by x, mod_y is the remainder when num is divided by y, required_mod_x is (x - mod_x) % x, and required_mod_y is mod_y)**
