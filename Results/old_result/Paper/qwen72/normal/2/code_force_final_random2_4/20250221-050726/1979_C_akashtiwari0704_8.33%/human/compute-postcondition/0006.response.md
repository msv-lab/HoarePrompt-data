The value of `prod` is updated to `prod * a[i]`. Since `i` is 0, `prod` becomes `1 * a[0]`, which simplifies to `a[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `prod` is `a[0]`, `i` is 0**.
