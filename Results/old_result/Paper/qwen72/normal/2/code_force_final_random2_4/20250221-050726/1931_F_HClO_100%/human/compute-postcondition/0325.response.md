Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 2, `val` contains `m-2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, the program prints 'yes', `n` is greater than 1, `a1` is assigned the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is assigned the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 1. If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is `n` and `p1` is 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is `n` and `p2` is 1. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
