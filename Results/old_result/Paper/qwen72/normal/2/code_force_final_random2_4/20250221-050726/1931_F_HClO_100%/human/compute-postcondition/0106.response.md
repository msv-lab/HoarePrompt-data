To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case are `_` and `m`.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for _ in range(m - 2):` will execute if `m - 2` is greater than 0. This means `m` must be greater than 2.
2. **Initial State of `_`**: The variable `_` is used as a placeholder in the loop, and its initial value is 0. However, the value of `_` does not affect the loop's execution condition.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`m`**: To ensure the loop executes, `m` must be greater than 2.
- **`_`**: The value of `_` is not relevant to the loop's execution condition, so it can remain 0.

### Final State:
State: **`_` is 0, `m` must be greater than 2**
