Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes no explicit parameters but reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the user input. It then returns a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the alphabet (from 'a' to 'w') repeated `n` times. The values of `n` and `k` must be within the range 1 to 26. After the function concludes, the program has returned the constructed string and the input variables `n` and `k` are no longer accessible outside the function. **
