Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It calculates the balance for each prefix of the input string and stores this information along with the negative index and the character itself. The use of negative indices ensures that when there are ties in the balance values, the characters are sorted in decreasing order of their positions, as required. After sorting, the characters are concatenated to form the result string, which is then printed.

The key points to verify are:
1. **Balance Calculation**: The balance is correctly updated for each character in the input string.
2. **Tuple Construction**: Each tuple in the `details` list is constructed with the correct balance, negative index, and character.
3. **Sorting**: The sorting criteria ensure that the tuples are ordered by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order when balances are equal.
4. **Result Construction**: The characters are extracted from the sorted list and joined to form the final result string.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation and produce the expected output for any valid input string.

Correctness: **True**
