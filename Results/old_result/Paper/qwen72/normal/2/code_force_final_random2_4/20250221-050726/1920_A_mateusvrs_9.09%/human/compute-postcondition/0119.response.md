The value of `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and the current value of `ax`, which is 1000000007. Since `x` is an integer provided by user input, `ax` will be the smaller of `x` and 1000000007. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `t` is greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1.**
