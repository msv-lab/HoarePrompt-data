The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the loop body and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. It does not change the values of any variables.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, and the current value of `m` is 1. We skip the rest of the loop body and proceed to the next iteration.**
