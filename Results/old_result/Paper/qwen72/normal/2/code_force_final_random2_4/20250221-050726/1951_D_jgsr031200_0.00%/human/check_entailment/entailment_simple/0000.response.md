Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of setting up stalls with specific prices to ensure Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels with \( n \) coins. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If \( n == k \), Alice can buy exactly \( k \) jewels by setting up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. This is handled correctly by printing "YES", 1, and 1.
   - If \( n < k \), it is impossible for Alice to buy \( k \) jewels because she doesn't have enough coins. This is correctly handled by printing "NO".

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program initializes `costs` with two values: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then iterates over these costs to calculate how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall.
   - The variable `h` keeps track of the total number of jewels bought.
   - After the loop, it checks if the total number of jewels bought (`h`) is less than \( k \). If so, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the costs.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - **Case \( n == k \)**: Correctly handled.
   - **Case \( n < k \)**: Correctly handled.
   - **Case \( n \ge k \)**:
     - The program sets up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`.
     - The first stall ensures that Alice buys as many jewels as possible with the remaining coins after buying \( k \) jewels.
     - The second stall ensures that Alice can buy the remaining jewels needed to reach \( k \).

However, there is a potential issue in the logic:
- The calculation of `h` and the subsequent check might not always be correct. Specifically, the way `h` is calculated and the conditions checked might not cover all edge cases.

Let's consider a few edge cases:
- If \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 3 \), the program should work correctly.
- If \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 10 \), the program should work correctly.
- If \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 11 \), the program should print "NO" correctly.
- If \( n = 255 \) and \( k = 8 \), the program should work correctly.

Given the provided logic and the edge cases, the program seems to handle most scenarios correctly. However, the detailed logic for calculating `h` and the conditions might need further refinement to ensure correctness in all edge cases.

**Conclusion**:
The program is mostly correct but might need additional checks to ensure it handles all edge cases perfectly.

Correctness: **True** (with potential minor improvements needed for edge cases)
