Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `q` is 2, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character, `ac` is 1, and `bc` is 0. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, the number of 'A' characters in `s` is greater than the number of non-'A' characters. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`. The current character being processed (`i`) is 'A'.**
