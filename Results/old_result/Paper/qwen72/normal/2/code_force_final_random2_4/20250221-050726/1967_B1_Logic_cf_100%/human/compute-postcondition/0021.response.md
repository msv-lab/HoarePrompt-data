To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` and `m` are integers.
- `min(n, m) >= 3`.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `T` is 1.
- `ans` is `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`.
- `b` is 3.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `b`, `n`, and `m`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `b` is less than `min(n, m) + 1`.

### Current State:
- `b` is 3.
- `min(n, m) >= 3`.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be incremented by 1.
- The new value of `b` will be 4.
- The condition `b < min(n, m) + 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

### Adjusted State:
- `b` is 4.
- `min(n, m) >= 3` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

Since `min(n, m) >= 3` is already satisfied, the loop will execute again if `b` is 4 and `min(n, m) >= 3`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `m` are integers, `min(n, m) >= 3`, `t` is greater than 1, `T` is 1, `ans` is `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`, `b` is 4**
