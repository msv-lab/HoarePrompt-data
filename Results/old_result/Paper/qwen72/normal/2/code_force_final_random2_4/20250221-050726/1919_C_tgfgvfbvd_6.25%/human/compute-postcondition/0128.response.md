Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 2`, and `y + 2 < n`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then: if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, `a` is updated to `l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then: if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, either `a` or `b` is updated to `l[x]` based on the condition: if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, `a` is updated to `l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then: if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, `a` is updated to `l[x]`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`.***
