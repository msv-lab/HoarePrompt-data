Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. It generates a permutation of integers from 1 to `n` such that for each `i` from 0 to `k-1`, the elements at indices `i, i+k, i+2*k, ...` up to the last valid index are set to consecutive integers starting from 1. The function then prints this permutation as a space-separated string. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the function does not return any value. **
