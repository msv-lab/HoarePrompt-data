Output State: **`a` is an integer converted from its original string value, `b` is an integer (unchanged from its original integer value), `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `a` and `b` are now the integers parsed from the input string, `t1` is updated to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is either `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `b // 2 + 1` if `b` is odd.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- The value of `t` is determined based on whether `b` is even or odd:
  - If `b` is even, `t` is updated to `b // 2`.
  - If `b` is odd, `t` is updated to `b // 2 + 1`.
- All other variables (`a`, `b`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
