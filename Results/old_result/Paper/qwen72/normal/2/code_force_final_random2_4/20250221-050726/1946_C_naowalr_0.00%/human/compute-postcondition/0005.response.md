The code reads a line from standard input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers.**
