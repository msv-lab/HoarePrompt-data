The code snippet `arr.append(1)` adds the value `1` to the list `arr`. The impact of this code is solely on the `arr` list, which will have an additional element `1` appended to it.

Let's analyze the different cases based on the initial state:

1. **If `lex` < 28:**
   - Initial `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 79], [lex - 1]]`.
   - Initial `arr` is `[1, 1]`.
   - After appending `1`, `arr` becomes `[1, 1, 1]`.

2. **If `lex` >= 28 and `lex` < 52:**
   - Initial `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 79], [lex + 25]]`.
   - Initial `arr` is `[26, 1]`.
   - After appending `1`, `arr` becomes `[26, 1, 1]`.

3. **If `lex` >= 52 and the original `lex` was less than 28:**
   - Initial `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 27]]`.
   - Initial `arr` is `[1, 26]`.
   - After appending `1`, `arr` becomes `[1, 26, 1]`.

4. **If `lex` >= 52 and the original `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive):**
   - Initial `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 26 + 26]]`.
   - Initial `arr` is `[26, 26]`.
   - After appending `1`, `arr` becomes `[26, 26, 1]`.

5. **If `lex` >= 52 and the original `lex` was 52 or greater:**
   - Initial `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 26]]`.
   - Initial `arr` is `[26]`.
   - After appending `1`, `arr` becomes `[26, 1]`.

6. **If the original `lex` was greater than 78:**
   - `lex` remains unchanged.
   - `info` and `arr` retain their initial values.
   - Initial `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 79], [lex - 1]]` if `lex` < 28, `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 79], [lex + 25]]` if `lex` >= 28 and `lex` < 52, `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 27]]` if `lex` >= 52 and the original `lex` was less than 28, `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 26 + 26]]` if `lex` >= 52 and the original `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 26]]` if `lex` >= 52 and the original `lex` was 52 or greater.
   - Initial `arr` is `[1, 1]` if `lex` < 28, `[26, 1]` if `lex` >= 28 and `lex` < 52, `[1, 26]` if `lex` >= 52 and the original `lex` was less than 28, `[26, 26]` if `lex` >= 52 and the original `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `[26]` if `lex` >= 52 and the original `lex` was 52 or greater.
   - After appending `1`, `arr` becomes `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` < 28, `[26, 1, 1]` if `lex` >= 28 and `lex` < 52, `[1, 26, 1]` if `lex` >= 52 and the original `lex` was less than 28, `[26, 26, 1]` if `lex` >= 52 and the original `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `[26, 1]` if `lex` >= 52 and the original `lex` was 52 or greater.

Output State: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2. If `lex` < 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 79], [lex - 1]]` and `arr` is `[1, 1, 1]`. If `lex` >= 28 and `lex` < 52, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 79], [lex + 25]]` and `arr` is `[26, 1, 1]`. If `lex` >= 52 and the original `lex` was less than 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 27]]` and `arr` is `[1, 26, 1]`. If `lex` >= 52 and the original `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 26 + 26]]` and `arr` is `[26, 26, 1]`. If `lex` >= 52 and the original `lex` was 52 or greater, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 26]]` and `arr` is `[26, 1]`. If the original `lex` was greater than 78, `lex` remains unchanged, and `info` and `arr` retain their initial values as specified in the precondition.**
