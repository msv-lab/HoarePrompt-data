The code appends a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` to the list `details`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, and `char` is the first character in `s`. If `char` is '(', `balance` is 1; if `char` is ')', `balance` is -1. After executing the code, the list `details` will contain one tuple with these values.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it should be a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character in `s`. If `char` is '(', `balance` is 1. If `char` is ')', `balance` is -1. `details` is a list containing the tuple `(balance, 0, char)`.**
