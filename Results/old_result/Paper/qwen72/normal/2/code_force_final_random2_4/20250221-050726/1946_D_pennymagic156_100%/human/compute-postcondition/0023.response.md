Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers with the first element being 0, `val` is the second element of `a`, `op` is updated by toggling its least significant bit based on the result of `val >> i & 1`, `t` is a list containing [0, `val`], `ai` is equal to `val`.**

Explanation:
- The code `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` (which is equal to `val`) to the list `t`.
- Initially, `t` was a list containing only `[0]`.
- After appending `ai` (which is `val`), `t` now contains `[0, val]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `val`, `op`, `ai`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
