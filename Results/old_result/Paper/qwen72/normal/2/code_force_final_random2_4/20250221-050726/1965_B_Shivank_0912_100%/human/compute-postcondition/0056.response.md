Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 2, `i` is 3, `j` is 19, `n` is the first input integer, `k` must be at least 2, and the list `ans` contains the initial elements `[k - 1, k + 1, k + 2]` followed by the powers of 2 from `1 << 1` to `1 << 19`.** 

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
