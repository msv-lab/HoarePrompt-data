Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
- `k` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18.
- `n` is equal to `k`.

Given these conditions, the value of `n` is explicitly stated to be equal to `k`. Therefore, when the `print(n)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `n`, which is the same as the value of `k`.

Output: **n (where n is equal to k and both are input integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18)**
