The code `ans.append(1 << j)` appends the value of `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given that `j` is 20, `1 << j` evaluates to `1 << 20`, which is 1048576.

If `j` is not equal to `i`, the initial state of `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 524288, 1048576]`. After appending `1 << j` (which is 1048576), the new state of `ans` becomes `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 524288, 1048576, 1048576]`.

If `j` is equal to `i`, the initial state of `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1048576]`. After appending `1 << j` (which is 1048576), the new state of `ans` becomes `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1048576, 1048576]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `i` is the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \), `j` is 20, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least \( 2^i \), `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 524288, 1048576, 1048576]` if `j` is not equal to `i`, otherwise `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1048576, 1048576]`.**
