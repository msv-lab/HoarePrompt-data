The function `func_3` takes two parameters, `primary_items` and `secondary_heap`, both of which are lists of tuples containing two integers each. It calculates and returns the sum of the first elements in all tuples in `secondary_heap` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `primary_items` where the sum of the first and second elements is non-negative. The original lists `primary_items` and `secondary_heap` remain unchanged.
