The code snippet `s[i] = '-1'` updates the list `s` at index `i` to be `'-1'`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `s[2]` is updated to `'-1'`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where `s[2]` is now `'-1'` and the other elements are either '1' or '0' depending on the corresponding bit in `x`, and `flag` remains unchanged.**
