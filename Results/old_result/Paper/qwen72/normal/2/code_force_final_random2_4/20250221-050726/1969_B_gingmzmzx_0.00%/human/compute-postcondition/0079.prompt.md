You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, s is a binary string with 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of lengths of strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the final input binary string, `n` is 0, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [number of 0s in `s`, number of 1s in `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s in `s` multiplied by the total number of zeros in `s` minus the cumulative count of 0s encountered up to each 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts a binary string `s`. It processes each binary string and returns a result based on the processing of these strings. The function ensures that `t` is within the range 1 to 10^4, and each binary string `s` has a length between 2 and 2 · 10^5, with the total length of all strings not exceeding 2 · 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
