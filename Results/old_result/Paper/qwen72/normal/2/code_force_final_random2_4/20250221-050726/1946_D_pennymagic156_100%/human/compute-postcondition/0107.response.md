Output State: **`u` is 1, `v` is even and non-zero, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `op` is the result of XORing the 29th bit (from the right) of all elements in `a`, and `cnt` is the count of elements in `a` whose 29th bit (from the right) is 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `val` in the list `a`.
- For each `val`, the 29th bit (from the right) is extracted using `val >> 28 & 1` and XORed with `op`.
- If the result of the XOR operation is 0, `cnt` is incremented.
- After the loop completes, `op` will hold the result of XORing the 29th bit of all elements in `a`.
- `cnt` will hold the number of elements in `a` whose 29th bit is 0.
