The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Let's break down the impact of this code on the program:

- `sums` is calculated as `sum1 + a[1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- `ans` is updated to include the value of `sums`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an integer provided by the user input.
- `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 1.
- `x` is an integer provided by the user input.
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input.
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `i` is 2.
- `sums` is updated to `sum1 + a[1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- `ans` remains unchanged.

After executing `ans.append(sums)`, the value of `sums` is appended to the list `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 1, `x` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is 2, `sums` is `sum1 + a[1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 + a[1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
