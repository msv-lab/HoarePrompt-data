Postcondition: ***`_` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `a` and `b` are the new input integers, `n` and `m` are now the integers from the input split by space, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `x` is the last element of the list `l`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - 2 * p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.***
