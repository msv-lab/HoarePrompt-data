The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition but operates under the context of processing multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, where each test case has its own `n` and `a`. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It returns a result for each test case.**
