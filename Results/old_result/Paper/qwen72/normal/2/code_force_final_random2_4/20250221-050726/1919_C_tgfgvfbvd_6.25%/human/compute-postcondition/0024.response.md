Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is the value of `l[x]`, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or 0 if no such element exists, `c` is 0, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`. Additionally, the current value of `l[x]` is greater than the new value of `a` and greater than `b`, and the difference between `l[x]` and the new value of `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`.**
