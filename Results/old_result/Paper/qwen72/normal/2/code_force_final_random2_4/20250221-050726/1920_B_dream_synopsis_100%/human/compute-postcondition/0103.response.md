Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the new user-provided integer, `k` is the new user-provided integer and must be non-negative, `x` is the new user-provided integer, `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k`, `ans` is a list containing one element. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, `ans` contains the value of `sums`. `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `sums` using the formula `sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `sums` after the update depends on the current values of `a`, `i`, and `x`, but the formula used for the update is provided.
