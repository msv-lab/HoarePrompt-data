The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (number of test cases). For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, followed by a list `l` of `n` integers. It then computes a list `p` of cumulative sums of the elements in `l`. For each of the `m` queries, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, calculates a value `s` based on the cumulative sums in `p`, and checks if the condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` holds. If the condition is true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function ends.
