Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, `b` is a list with the last two elements being the cumulative sums of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy certain conditions.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains a non-zero integer decreased by 1, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Must be at least 4 to ensure the loop can run at least once, but it remains unchanged.
- **`a`**: The list of integers remains unchanged.
- **`m`**: Remains unchanged.
- **`queries`**: Remains unchanged.
- **`b`**: The list `b` starts as `[0, 0]`. For each iteration of the loop, the list `b` is extended by two new elements:
  - The first new element is the sum of the second-to-last element of `b` and a value `v` raised to the power of whether `v` is greater than the difference between the current and previous elements in `a`.
  - The second new element is the sum of the last element of `b` and the same value `v` raised to the power of whether `v` is greater than the difference between the next and current elements in `a`.

After all iterations, `b` will contain the cumulative sums of these differences, reflecting the conditions specified in the loop.
