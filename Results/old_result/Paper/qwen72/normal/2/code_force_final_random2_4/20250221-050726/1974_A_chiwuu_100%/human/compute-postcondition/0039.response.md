The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. The loop condition is based on `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` was already incremented by 1, so for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented again. Therefore, if `i` was some value `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than this new value of `i`.

State: **`a` is an integer (converted from its original string value), `b` is an integer (unchanged from its original integer value), `t` is updated as described, `t1` is updated as described, `t2` is updated as described, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`**
