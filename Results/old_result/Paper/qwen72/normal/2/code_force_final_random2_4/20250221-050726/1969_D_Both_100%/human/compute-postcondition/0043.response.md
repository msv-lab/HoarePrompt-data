The only variable in the loop head is `combined`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `combined`. If `combined` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `combined` must contain at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `combined` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` contains `k` tuples with the highest second elements from `combined` (potentially including `item` and excluding the smallest element), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, but now it is `len(combined) - k - 1` elements shorter, and `combined` must contain at least one element. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. If `removed_item` is not `None`, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` remains unchanged.**
