The code appends a value to the list `ans`. The value appended is `(1 << i) - 1`, which is equivalent to `2^i - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`
- `arr` is an empty list
- `k0` is equal to `k`
- `ans` is an empty list
- The loop continues to execute as long as `temp * 2` is less than `k`
- After the loop finishes, `i` is the highest integer such that `2^i` is less than `k`, and `temp` is `2^i`

After executing the code snippet:
- `ans` now contains the value `(1 << i) - 1`, which is `2^i - 1`
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing the value `2^i - 1`, where `i` is the highest integer such that `2^i` is less than `k`.**
