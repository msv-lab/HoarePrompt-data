Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not solve the problem described in the problem statement. The problem requires calculating the year in which the nth sign will occur, considering that signs occur sequentially and strictly after the previous sign. However, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to handle a different problem involving a path with '@' and '*' characters, which is entirely unrelated to the given problem. The annotations and the annotated code further confirm that the program is solving a different problem, not the one described in the problem statement.

Final: **False**
