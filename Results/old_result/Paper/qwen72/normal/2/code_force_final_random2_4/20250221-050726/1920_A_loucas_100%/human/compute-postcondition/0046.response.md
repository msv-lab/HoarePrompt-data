The code snippet `num -= 1` decrements the value of `num` by 1. To determine the new value of `num`, we need to consider its initial value based on the conditions given in the initial state.

- `num` is initially set to `min(less) - max(big) - 1` if `i` is between the minimum value of `less` and the maximum value of `big` (inclusive).
- Otherwise, `num` is set to `min(less) - max(big)`.

After executing `num -= 1`, the new value of `num` will be:

- If `i` is between the minimum value of `less` and the maximum value of `big` (inclusive), `num` becomes `min(less) - max(big) - 2`.
- Otherwise, `num` becomes `min(less) - max(big) - 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has constraints (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is the last integer from the input, `a` is the last integer from the input, `big` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 2, `no` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 3 and must have at least two elements, `i` is the third element of `no`. If `i` is between the minimum value of `less` and the maximum value of `big` (inclusive), then `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - 2`. Otherwise, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - 1`.**
