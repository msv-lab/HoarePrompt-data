The code snippet `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. This modifies the structure of the adjacency list `adj`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `z` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `k` is the second integer read from the input
- `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input
- `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` before the loop terminates
- `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function
- `numCuts` is 0
- `R - L <= 1`

After executing the code snippet:
- The list `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a]` (since `a` was already in `adj[b]` and now it is appended again).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where `adj[a]` contains `[b, b]` and `adj[b]` contains `[a, a]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input, `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` before the loop terminates, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L <= 1`.**
