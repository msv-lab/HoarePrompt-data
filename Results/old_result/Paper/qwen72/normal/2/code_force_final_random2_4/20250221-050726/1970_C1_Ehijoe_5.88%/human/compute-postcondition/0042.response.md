Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `i` is 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque containing `u` appended to its right side.** 

The value of `u` is appended to the right side of the deque `tree`, while the other variables (`n`, `t`, `i`, `v`, `empty`) remain unchanged. The conditions related to `tree` and `u`, `v` remain as they were before the code execution.
