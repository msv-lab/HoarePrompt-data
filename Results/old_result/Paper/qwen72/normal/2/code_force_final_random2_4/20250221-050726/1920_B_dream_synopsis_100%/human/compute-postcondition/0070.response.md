Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the user-provided integer, `k` is the user-provided integer, `x` is the user-provided integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` followed by the new value of `sums`, and `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.** 

Explanation:
- The variable `sums` is updated to the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- The list `ans` is updated to include the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` followed by the new value of `sums`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `i`) remain unchanged except for `i` which is incremented by 1.
