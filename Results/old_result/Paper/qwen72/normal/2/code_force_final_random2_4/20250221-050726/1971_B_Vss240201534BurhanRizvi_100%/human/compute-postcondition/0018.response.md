The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t` and `s`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the content of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('No')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'No'`.
   - The variables `t` and `s` are not referenced in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The output of the `print` statement will be the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
