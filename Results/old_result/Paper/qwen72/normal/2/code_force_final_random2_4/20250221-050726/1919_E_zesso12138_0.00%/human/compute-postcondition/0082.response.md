Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order. It calculates the number of ways to reach a specific position from the starting position (0) using exactly `n` steps, where each step can either be +1 or -1. The specific position is determined by adding the last element of the list `p` to `n`. The result is returned modulo MOD. After the function executes, `n` and `p` remain unchanged, and the function returns an integer representing the number of valid paths to the specified position. **
