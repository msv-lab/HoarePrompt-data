Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of children `n`, the number of friend pairs `m`, and the number of excursions `k`.

2. **Friendship Value Calculation**: The program calculates the sum of initial friendship values (`sum_f`) for all pairs of friends. This is done correctly using a loop that iterates `m` times, reading the friend pairs and their initial friendship values.

3. **Combinatorial Calculation**: The program computes the number of ways to choose 2 children from `n` children (`cn2`), which is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This is the correct combinatorial formula for choosing 2 items from `n` items without repetition.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**: The program calculates the numerator `p` and the denominator `q` of the expected value. The formula used is:
   \[
   p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
   \]
   \[
   q = 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2
   \]
   These formulas are derived from the problem's requirements and seem to be correct.

5. **Simplification and Modulo Operation**: The program simplifies the fraction `p/q` by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (gcd). It then calculates the modular inverse of `q` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and multiplies it by `p` to get the final result. This is done using the `pow` function with the third argument as the modulus.

6. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the expected value of the sum of friendship values modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
