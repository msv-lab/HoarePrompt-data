To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
- `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers.
- `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `t`: This variable is mentioned but not used in the `print` statement, so it doesn't affect the output directly.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k`: These are input integers. Their specific values are not provided, but they are inputs to the function `func_1`.
   - `friendships`: This is a list of `m` lists, where each inner list contains two integers. These integers represent pairs of friends.
   - `result`: This is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`. The exact value of `result` depends on the implementation of `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`.
   - The purpose of `func_1` is not explicitly stated, but it processes the input parameters and returns a value.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the value returned by `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the precise numerical value of `result`. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

### Final Output:
Output: **result (where result is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`)**
