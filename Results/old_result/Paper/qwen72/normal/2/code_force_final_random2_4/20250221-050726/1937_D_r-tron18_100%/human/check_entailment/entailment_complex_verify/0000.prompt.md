You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and a positive integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5. It computes a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element in `ans` represents a specific value derived from the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. After computing these values, the function prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. The final state of the program is that `ans` contains the computed values for each position in the string `s1`, and these values are printed to the console.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program is complex and uses several optimizations that make it difficult to verify without extensive testing. However, one potential issue can be identified in the handling of the `<` and `>` characters and their corresponding movements and inversions.

### Potential Issue:
- **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not explicitly handle the edge case where the pinball starts at the very first or last cell and immediately leaves the grid. For example, if the grid is `">"` (a single cell with a `>`), the pinball should leave the grid in 1 second. Similarly, if the grid is `"<"`, the pinball should also leave the grid in 1 second. The program's logic might not correctly handle these simple edge cases.

### Example Case:
- **Input**: `s = ">"`
- **Expected Output**: `1`
- **Actual Output**: The program might not produce the correct output because it relies on complex accumulation and indexing operations that might not account for such simple edge cases.

Given this potential issue, the program cannot be considered correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
