Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `a` must have at least 6 elements.
- `w` is the third element of `a`.
- `x` is the fourth element of `a`.
- `y` is the fifth element of `a`.
- `z` is the sixth element of `a`.
- `v` is `y - x`.
- `b` is extended by two new elements:
  - `b[-2] + v` if `v > x - w`, otherwise `b[-2] + 1`.
  - `b[-1] + v` if `v > z - y`, otherwise `b[-1] + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `v`:**
   - `v = y - x`

2. **Determine the new elements to be added to `b`:**
   - First new element: `b[-2] + v` if `v > x - w`, otherwise `b[-2] + 1`.
   - Second new element: `b[-1] + v` if `v > z - y`, otherwise `b[-1] + 1`.

3. **Update `b` with the new elements:**
   - `b` is extended by the two new elements calculated above.

### Calculation:
- Let's denote the last two elements of `b` before the update as `b[-2]` and `b[-1]`.
- The first new element to be added to `b` is:
  - `b[-2] + v` if `v > x - w`
  - `b[-2] + 1` if `v <= x - w`
- The second new element to be added to `b` is:
  - `b[-1] + v` if `v > z - y`
  - `b[-1] + 1` if `v <= z - y`

### Output State:
- `a` must have at least 6 elements.
- `w` is the third element of `a`.
- `x` is the fourth element of `a`.
- `y` is the fifth element of `a`.
- `z` is the sixth element of `a`.
- `v` is `y - x`.
- `b` is extended by two new elements:
  - The first new element is `b[-2] + v` if `v > x - w`, otherwise `b[-2] + 1`.
  - The second new element is `b[-1] + v` if `v > z - y`, otherwise `b[-1] + 1`.

Output State: **`a` must have at least 6 elements, `w` is the third element of `a`, `x` is the fourth element of `a`, `y` is the fifth element of `a`, `z` is the sixth element of `a`, `v` is `y - x`, `b` is extended by two new elements: `b[-2] + v` if `v > x - w`, otherwise `b[-2] + 1`, and `b[-1] + v` if `v > z - y`, otherwise `b[-1] + 1`.**
