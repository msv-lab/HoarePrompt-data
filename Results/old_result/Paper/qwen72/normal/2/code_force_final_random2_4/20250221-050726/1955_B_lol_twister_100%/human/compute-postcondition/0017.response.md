Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is `n-1`, and `li` has `2n-1` elements. The first `n` elements of `li` are `[a, a + d, a + 2 * d, ..., a + (n-1) * d]`, and the next `n-1` elements are `[a + k * c + d * 0, a + k * c + d * 1, a + k * c + d * 2, ..., a + k * c + d * (n-2)]`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- The variable `h` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration of the loop, ending at `n-1`.
- The list `li` initially contains `n` elements: `[a, a + d, a + 2 * d, ..., a + (n-1) * d]`.
- For each iteration of the loop, a new element `a + k * c + d * h` is appended to `li`.
- After `n` iterations, `li` will have `n` (initial elements) + `n` (newly appended elements) - 1 (since `h` starts at 0 and goes up to `n-1`) = `2n - 1` elements in total.
