Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `xa` is an input integer, `ya` is an input integer, `xb` is an input integer, `yb` is an input integer, `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`**. 

The value of `x` is calculated as the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2, using integer division. All other variables remain unchanged.
