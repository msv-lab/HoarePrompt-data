Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is greater than 1, `h` is the integer value of the hour part of the new input, and `m` is the integer value of the minute part of the new input. If `h` > 12, `h` is adjusted to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.***
