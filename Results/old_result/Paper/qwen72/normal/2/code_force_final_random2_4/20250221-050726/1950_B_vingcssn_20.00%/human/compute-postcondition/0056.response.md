The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a fixed string: `'..##..##'`. This string does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. Therefore, regardless of the values of `c`, `casos`, or `n`, the `print` statement will always output the same string.

Output: **..##..##**
