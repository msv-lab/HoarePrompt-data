The code appends a new element to the list `li`. The new element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`. Given that `k` is 0 and `h` is 2, the expression simplifies to `a + 0 * c + d * 2`, which further simplifies to `a + 2 * d`.

Therefore, the new element added to `li` is `a + 2 * d`.

The updated list `li` now contains three elements: `[a, a + d, a + 2 * d]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing three elements `[a, a + d, a + 2 * d]`, `k` is 0, `h` is 2.**
