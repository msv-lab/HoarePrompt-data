To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - `left`: This is the current index being checked.
   - `len(s)`: The length of the list `s`.
   - `s[left]`: The character at the current index `left`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\).
   - `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order.
   - `left` is 2.
   - `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found.
   - `cost` is 2.
   - `s[1]` must not be '1'.

3. **Loop Condition Breakdown:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `left` is less than the length of `s` and the character at index `left` is not '1'.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `left` must be less than `len(s)`.
   - Additionally, `s[left]` must not be '1'.

### Current Values:
- `left` is 2.
- `len(s)` is the length of the list `s`, which is the same as the length of `sChar`.

### Adjustments:
- Since `left` is 2, it is already less than `len(s)` (which is at least 2).
- We need to ensure that `s[left]` is not '1'. Given that `left` is 2, we need to check `s[2]`.

### Conclusion:
- If `s[2]` is not '1', the loop can execute one more time.
- If `s[2]` is '1', the loop will not execute.

Since we cannot change the content of `s` directly, we need to ensure that the conditions are met based on the given state.

### Final State:
- `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order.
- `left` is 2.
- `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found.
- `cost` is 2.
- `s[1]` must not be '1'.
- `s[2]` must not be '1' for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `left` is 2, `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found, `cost` is 2, `s[1]` must not be '1', and `s[2]` must not be '1'**.
