The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the context given, it is implied that the function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`. The function calculates the total cost for buying `n` buns, where the first bun is sold at a modified price `b`, and all subsequent buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun). It returns the total cost for buying `n` buns, where the first bun is sold at price `b` and the remaining `n-1` buns are sold at price `a`.**
