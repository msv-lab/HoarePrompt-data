The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program based on the initial state.

### Initial State:
- `cases` must be at least 2
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 2
- Depending on the value of `lex`:
  - If `lex` < 28:
    - `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 79], [lex - 1]]`
    - `arr` is `[1, 1]`
  - If `lex` >= 28 and `lex` < 52:
    - `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 79], [lex + 25]]`
    - `arr` is `[26, 1]`
  - If `lex` >= 52:
    - If the original `lex` was less than 28:
      - `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 27]]`
      - `arr` is `[1, 26]`
    - If the original `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive):
      - `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 26 + 26]]`
      - `arr` is `[26, 26]`
    - If the original `lex` was 52 or greater:
      - `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 26]]`
      - `arr` is `[26]`
    - If the original `lex` was greater than 78:
      - `lex` remains unchanged
      - `info` and `arr` retain their initial values as specified in the precondition

### Impact of the Code:
- The value 26 is appended to the list `arr`.

### Calculation:
- For each case, the value 26 is added to the end of the list `arr`.

### Output State:
- `cases` must be at least 2
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 2
- Depending on the value of `lex`:
  - If `lex` < 28:
    - `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 79], [lex - 1]]`
    - `arr` is `[1, 1, 26]`
  - If `lex` >= 28 and `lex` < 52:
    - `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 79], [lex + 25]]`
    - `arr` is `[26, 1, 26]`
  - If `lex` >= 52:
    - If the original `lex` was less than 28:
      - `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 27]]`
      - `arr` is `[1, 26, 26]`
    - If the original `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive):
      - `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 26 + 26]]`
      - `arr` is `[26, 26, 26]`
    - If the original `lex` was 52 or greater:
      - `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 26]]`
      - `arr` is `[26, 26]`
    - If the original `lex` was greater than 78:
      - `lex` remains unchanged
      - `info` and `arr` retain their initial values as specified in the precondition, with `arr` now being `[26, 26]`

Output State: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `info` and `lex` retain their initial values, and `arr` is updated as follows:**
- If `lex` < 28: `arr` is `[1, 1, 26]`
- If `lex` >= 28 and `lex` < 52: `arr` is `[26, 1, 26]`
- If `lex` >= 52 and the original `lex` was less than 28: `arr` is `[1, 26, 26]`
- If `lex` >= 52 and the original `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive): `arr` is `[26, 26, 26]`
- If `lex` >= 52 and the original `lex` was 52 or greater: `arr` is `[26, 26]`
- If `lex` > 78: `arr` is `[26, 26]`
