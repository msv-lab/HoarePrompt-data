The code snippet `big = []` reassigns the variable `big` to an empty list. This overrides the previous value of `big`, which was a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has constraints (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `loop` must be greater than 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is the last integer from the input, `a` is the last integer from the input, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 3, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - k` where `k` is the number of elements in `no` that satisfy the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`**.
