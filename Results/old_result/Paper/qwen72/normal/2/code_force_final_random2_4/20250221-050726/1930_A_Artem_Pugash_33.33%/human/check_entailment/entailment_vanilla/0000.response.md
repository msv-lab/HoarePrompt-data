Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases (`numCases`). For each test case, it reads the number of pairs (`numInteger`) and the list of integers (`numbers`).

2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order using `numbers.sort(reverse=False)`. This ensures that when we take pairs of elements from the beginning of the list, the smaller element in each pair will always be the first element, which is optimal for maximizing the sum of the minimum values.

3. **Sum Calculation**: The function initializes a variable `suma` to 0, which will store the total score. It then enters a loop where it repeatedly pops the first two elements from the sorted list, adds the minimum of these two elements to `suma`, and continues until the list is empty.

4. **Output**: After processing all pairs for a test case, the function prints the total score `suma`.

### Analysis:
- **Optimality**: By sorting the list in ascending order, the function ensures that the smallest elements are paired together first. This is the optimal strategy because the minimum value in each pair will be as large as possible, leading to the maximum possible score.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly. For example, if the list has only two elements, it will correctly compute the minimum of those two elements.
- **Efficiency**: The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\) time, and the subsequent operations (popping elements and adding to the sum) take \(O(n)\) time, making the overall complexity \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output formats correctly, and the algorithm used is optimal for maximizing the score.

Correctness: **True**
