Initial State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cnt` is set to `min(n // 2, m // 2)` if the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1, otherwise `cnt` remains 0.

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The GCD of `x` (which is 1) and `y` (which is 2) is 1.
2. Therefore, `cnt` is initially set to `min(n // 2, m // 2)`.
3. The code snippet `cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is executed.
4. Calculate `(x + y) * x` and `(x + y) * y`:
   - `(x + y) * x` = (1 + 2) * 1 = 3
   - `(x + y) * y` = (1 + 2) * 2 = 6
5. Calculate `n // 3` and `m // 6`:
   - `n // 3` = floor(n / 3)
   - `m // 6` = floor(m / 6)
6. `cnt` is updated by adding the minimum of these two values:
   - `cnt += min(n // 3, m // 6)`

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6, `x` is 1, `y` is 2, `cnt` is now `min(n // 2, m // 2) + min(n // 3, m // 6)`**.
