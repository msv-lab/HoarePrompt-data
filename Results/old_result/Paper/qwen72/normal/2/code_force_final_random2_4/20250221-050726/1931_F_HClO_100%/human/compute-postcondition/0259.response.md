Output State: **`m` is greater than 2, `val` contains `m-2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, and the program prints 'yes'. `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user through `input()`. All other variables (`_`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`) retain their initial values.**

Explanation:
- The `input()` function is called, which prompts the user to enter values. These values are used to update `n` and `m`.
- Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user, these updates are reflected in the output state.
- All other variables and conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.
