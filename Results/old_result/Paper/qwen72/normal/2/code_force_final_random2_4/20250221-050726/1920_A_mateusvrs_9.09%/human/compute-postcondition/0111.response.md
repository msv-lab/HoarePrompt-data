The value of `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and the current value of `ax`. Since `ax` is initially 1000000007, and `x` is an integer provided by user input, the new value of `ax` will be the smaller of these two values. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is not equal to 1, and the current value of `a` is 2.**
