To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
- `b` is an empty list.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the value `n`.
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 (since `range(n)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1` if `n > 0`).
- The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure `n` is greater than 0.
- Initialize `i` to 0.

### Final State:
The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be initialized to 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
