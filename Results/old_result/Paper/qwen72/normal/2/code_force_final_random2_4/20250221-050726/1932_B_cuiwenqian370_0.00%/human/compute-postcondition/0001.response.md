The code snippet `data = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings based on spaces. This operation updates the variable `data` with the split input.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs.
- `path` is a string containing `n` space-separated integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs.
- The `input` function reads from `sys.stdin`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `data` is updated to a list of strings, where each string is one of the space-separated values read from the input.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `path` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `path` is a string containing `n` space-separated integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), `data` is a list of strings containing the split input.**
