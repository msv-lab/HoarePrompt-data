You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5.
def func_2(s1, n):
    pre = [(i + 1) for i, el in enumerate(s1) if el == '>']
    totalOne = len(pre)
    preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))
    suffZero = [0]
    ans = [0] * n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        el = s1[i]
        
        if el == '>':
            ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
            if ol <= zr:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
                oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
                oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
                fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
            preOne.pop()
            totalOne -= 1
        else:
            suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
            ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
            if zr <= ol:
                zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
                oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is -1, `el` is the first character of `s1`, `totalOne` is 0, `preOne` is empty, `suffZero` contains the cumulative sums of the 1-based indices of all '<' characters in `s1`, and `ans` contains the computed values for each position in the string `s1`.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: the computed values for each position in the string s1 (where s1 is the input string and ans contains the computed values for each position in s1)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and a positive integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5. It returns a result based on the pattern of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
