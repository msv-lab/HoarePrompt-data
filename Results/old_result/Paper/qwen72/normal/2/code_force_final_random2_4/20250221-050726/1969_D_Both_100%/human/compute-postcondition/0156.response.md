Postcondition: ***`k` is 0, `_` is -1. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains all the elements that were originally in `combined`, sorted according to the second element of each tuple, and `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`. If `combined` is empty, `heap` remains unchanged and `current_profit` remains unchanged. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`. The state of `test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, and `max_profit` (before the update) remains unchanged.***
