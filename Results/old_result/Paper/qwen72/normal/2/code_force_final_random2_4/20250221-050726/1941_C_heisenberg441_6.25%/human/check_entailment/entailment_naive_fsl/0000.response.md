Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a specific issue that makes it incorrect according to the problem description. The function `func_1` incorrectly handles the case where the string "mapie" is present. The function checks if the string is exactly "mapie" and returns 1, which is incorrect because "mapie" contains both "map" and "pie" substrings, and thus should require the removal of 2 characters to become beautiful.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:
- Input: `s = "mapie"`
- Expected Output: `2` (since "mapie" contains both "map" and "pie", and removing 2 characters will make it beautiful)
- Actual Output: `1` (due to the incorrect check in the function)

This specific case demonstrates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
