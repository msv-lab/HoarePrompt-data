The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `k`, representing the number of islands and the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed, respectively. For each test case, the function prints the number of islands (`n`) if the difference between the number of islands and the number of bridges that can be destroyed (`n - k`) is less than or equal to 1; otherwise, it prints 1. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program includes the number of test cases processed (`t`), the last values of `n` and `k` read from the input, and the placeholder `_` used in the loop.
