### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Initial Assumption**: The function starts with the assumption that the array can be sorted (`ans = True`).

3. **Backward Iteration**: The function iterates through the array from the end to the beginning (`for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`). This is a good approach because it allows the function to check if the current element is less than the previous element, which is a key condition for determining if the array can be sorted.

4. **Condition Check**: If the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i - 1]`, the function splits the previous element into its digits and checks if the resulting list of digits plus the current element is sorted. This is done using the condition `if nums != sorted(nums):`.

5. **Update Array**: If the condition is satisfied, the function updates the previous element to the first digit of the split number (`arr[i - 1] = nums[0]`). This is a reasonable step because it ensures that the array remains in a state where further operations can be applied.

6. **Output**: After processing all elements, the function prints `YES` if the array can be sorted, otherwise `NO`.

### Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **State Before Function Call**: The function expects `t` to be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), and a list of `n` integers \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\) where \(0 \leq a_i \leq 99\).

- **Function Execution**:
  - **Reading Test Cases**: The function reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually.
  - **Reading Array Length and Elements**: For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array itself `arr`.
  - **Initialization**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `True`, assuming the array can be sorted.
  - **Backward Iteration**: The function iterates through the array from the end to the beginning.
  - **Condition Check**: If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, it splits `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the resulting list `nums`. It then checks if `nums` is sorted.
  - **Update Array**: If `nums` is sorted, it updates `arr[i - 1]` to the first digit of `nums`.
  - **Output**: After processing all elements, it prints `YES` if the array can be sorted, otherwise `NO`.

### Potential Issues:

- **Edge Cases**: The function does not explicitly handle edge cases where the array might already be sorted or where all elements are less than 10. However, the problem description guarantees that the input is valid, so these edge cases are not a concern.
- **Complexity**: The function has a time complexity of \(O(n \times d)\), where `n` is the length of the array and `d` is the number of digits in the largest number. This is efficient enough given the constraints.

### Conclusion:

The function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the given examples correctly and follows the problem's constraints and requirements.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
