To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `_` is 0 (This variable is not used in the loop head, so it doesn't need adjustment).
- `n` is the input positive integer.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `mak` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`. If no user input was `<`, `mak` remains 0.
- `mak2` is the same as `mak`.
- `pans` is an empty list.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 because `range(n)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
- The variable `i` is initialized in the loop head and will start from 0, regardless of its initial value before the loop.
- The other variables (`mak`, `mak2`, `pans`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- `i` will be set to 0 by the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is an empty list**
