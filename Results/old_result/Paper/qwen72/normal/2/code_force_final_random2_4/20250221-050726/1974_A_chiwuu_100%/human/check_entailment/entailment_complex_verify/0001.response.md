### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Screen Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the initial number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, the program uses the formula:
     ```python
     t = b
     if t % 2 == 0:
         t = t // 2
     else:
         t = t // 2 + 1
     ```
     This formula ensures that the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons is calculated correctly. If `b` is even, it divides by 2; if odd, it divides by 2 and adds 1. This part is correct.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The program then calculates the number of remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons:
     ```python
     t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
     ```
     Here, `t * 15` gives the total number of cells available in `t` screens, and `b * 4` gives the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons. This calculation is correct.

4. **Check if Remaining Cells are Sufficient**:
   - The program checks if the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons:
     ```python
     if t1 >= a:
         t = t
     else:
         t2 = a - t1
         if t2 % 15 == 0:
             t = t + t2 // 15
         else:
             t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
     ```
     - If the remaining cells are sufficient (`t1 >= a`), the number of screens remains `t`.
     - If not, it calculates the additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons. The formula `t2 % 15 == 0` ensures that if the remaining cells are exactly divisible by 15, it adds the exact number of screens. Otherwise, it adds one extra screen to account for the remainder. This part is also correct.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Verification with Test Cases:
Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

  - Initial screens for 2x2 icons: \(t = 1\)
  - Remaining cells: \(t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11\)

  - Output: 1 (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: \(a = 7\), \(b = 2\)
  - Initial screens for 2x2 icons: \(t = 1\)
  - Remaining cells: \(t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7\)

  - Since \(t1 < a\), additional screens are needed.
  - Additional screens: \(t2 = 12 - 14 = -2\) (This should be corrected to 12 - 14 = 2)
  - Additional screens required: \(2 // 15 + 1 = 1\)

  - Output: 2 (Correct)

- **Test Case 5**: \(a = 1\), \(b = 0\)
  - Initial screens for 2x2 icons: \(t = 0\)
  - Remaining cells: \(t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0\)
  - Since \(t1 < a\), additional screens are needed.
  - Additional screens: \(t2 = 1 - 0 = 1\)
