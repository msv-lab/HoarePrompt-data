Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` depending on the condition, `sunks` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `a[l]` is 0, `sunks` is incremented by 1, `k` is updated to `k - (a[r] * 2)`, and `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`. If `k` was 0 before the operation, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[l]` is not 0, no changes are made to `sunks`, `k`, or `a[l]`.***
