Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is a new input integer.
   - `j` is \(n - 1\).
   - `a` is 'TRIANGLE' because an input string `s` had exactly one '1'.
   - `b` is 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` had more than one '1', otherwise `b` is an empty string.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(a)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `a`:**
   - According to the initial state, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' because the input string `s` had exactly one '1'.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The print statement will print the value of `a`, which is 'TRIANGLE'.

Output: **TRIANGLE**
