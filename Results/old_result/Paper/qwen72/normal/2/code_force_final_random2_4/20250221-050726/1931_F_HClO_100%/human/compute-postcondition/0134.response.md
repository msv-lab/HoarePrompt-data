Output State: **`_` is `m-2`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` will be set by the last tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing at least `m-2` tuples, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and one line of input has been consumed. The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end and the next iteration to begin immediately.**
