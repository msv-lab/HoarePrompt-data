To determine what will be printed by the `print(c)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic involved:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `y` is the index where the loop broke or `n-1` if it did not break.
- `a` is the last element in `l` that was less than or equal to the previous elements encountered during the loop.
- `b` is the last element in `l` that was greater than the previous elements encountered during the loop.
- `c` is the count of elements in `l` that were greater than both `a` and `b` and met the specific update conditions within the loop.

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Break Condition**: The loop breaks when a certain condition is met, and `y` is the index at which this happens. If the loop completes without breaking, `y` is set to `n-1`.
2. **Variables `a` and `b`**:
   - `a` is the last element in `l` that was less than or equal to the previous elements encountered during the loop.
   - `b` is the last element in `l` that was greater than the previous elements encountered during the loop.
3. **Count `c`**:
   - `c` is the count of elements in `l` that were greater than both `a` and `b` and met the specific update conditions within the loop.

### What is Printed:
The `print(c)` statement will print the value of `c`, which is the count of elements in `l` that were greater than both `a` and `b` and met the specific update conditions within the loop.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and the elements in `l` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `c`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `c`.

### Final Output:
Output: **c (where c is the count of elements in l that were greater than both a and b and met the specific update conditions within the loop)**
