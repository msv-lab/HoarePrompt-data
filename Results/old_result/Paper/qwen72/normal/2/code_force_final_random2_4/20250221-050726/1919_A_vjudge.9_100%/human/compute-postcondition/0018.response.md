Output State: **`t` is equal to the initial value, `i` is `t-1`, `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input for the last iteration. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial value (since it is not modified within the loop). The loop counter `i` has reached the value `t-1`, which is the last index of the range specified by `range(t)`. For each iteration, `a` and `b` were provided as user input, and the loop checked whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` was even or odd, printing "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly. After the final iteration, `a` and `b` hold the values from the last user input, and the condition based on their absolute difference still holds as it did for each previous iteration.
