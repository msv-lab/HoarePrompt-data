Postcondition: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2]`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `y2` is `r[5]`, and `r` is a list of integers input by the user. Additionally, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, and `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`.**
