### Reasoning:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the prefix sums of the array `l` and stores them in the list `p`. This allows for efficient computation of the sum of any subarray using the formula \( \text{sum}(l[i:j]) = p[j-1] - p[i-1] \).

2. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program extracts the indices `a` and `b` which define the subarray `c[a-1:b]`.
   - It then calculates the sum of the subarray using the prefix sums: `s = p[b-1] - p[a-2]` if `a > 1`, otherwise `s = p[b-1]`.

3. **Conditions for a Good Subarray**:
   - The program checks if the subarray is good by verifying two conditions:
     - The length of the subarray must be greater than 1 (`b - a + 1 > 1`).
     - The sum of the subarray must be at least twice the length of the subarray (`s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`).

4. **Output**:
   - If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Condition 1**: The subarray length must be greater than 1. This ensures that there are at least two elements in the subarray, which is necessary to find a different array `b` where each element is different from the corresponding element in `a`.
- **Condition 2**: The sum of the subarray must be at least twice the length of the subarray. This ensures that there is enough "slack" to construct a different array `b` with positive elements that sum to the same value as `a`.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the subarray has only one element or when the sum of the subarray is too small to satisfy the conditions.

### Additional Considerations:
- The program correctly handles the input format and constraints specified in the problem description.
- The use of prefix sums ensures that the sum of any subarray can be computed in constant time, making the solution efficient.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
