The code snippet `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into three parts, and assigns each part to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` after converting them to integers. The initial state specifies that `i` is 0 and `int(input())` must be greater than 0, which implies that the input provided must be a positive integer.

Given that the input is split and converted to integers, and assuming the user provides valid input (three positive integers separated by spaces), the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` will each be assigned one of these integers.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer**
