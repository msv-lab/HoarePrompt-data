To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `i` is 2.
- `h` is a new input integer.
- `w` is a new input integer.
- `xa` is a new input integer.
- `ya` is a new input integer.
- `xb` is a new input integer.
- `yb` is a new input integer.
- `x` is calculated as `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`.
- `l` is calculated as `max(1, yb - x)`.
- `r` is calculated as `min(w, yb + x)`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `x`:**
   - `x = (abs(xa - xb) // 2)`: This calculates the integer division of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` by 2.

2. **Calculate `l`:**
   - `l = max(1, yb - x)`: This ensures that `l` is at least 1 and at most `yb - x`.

3. **Calculate `r`:**
   - `r = min(w, yb + x)`: This ensures that `r` is at most `w` and at least `yb + x`.

4. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` is evaluated:
     - `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1`: This checks if the absolute difference between `l` and `ya` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.
     - `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`: This checks if the absolute difference between `r` and `ya` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.

5. **Determine the Output:**
   - If both conditions are true, the expression `['Draw'], ['Alice']` will select `['Alice']` because the condition is true.
   - If either condition is false, the expression will select `['Draw']`.

6. **Print the Result:**
   - The `print` function will unpack the selected list and print its elements.

### Final Output:
Based on the conditions and the initial state, the output will be either "Draw" or "Alice" depending on whether the conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` are both true.

Output: **Draw or Alice (where the output is "Alice" if both conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` are true, otherwise "Draw")**
