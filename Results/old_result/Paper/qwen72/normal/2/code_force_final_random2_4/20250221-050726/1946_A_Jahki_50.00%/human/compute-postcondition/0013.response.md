The code snippet assigns the value of `int(num2 / 2) - 1` to the variable `ma`. Given that `num2` is an even integer and is less than or equal to 10000, the value of `ma` will be half of `num2` minus 1.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `num2` is an even integer, so `num2 / 2` will be an integer.
- Subtracting 1 from this result gives us `ma`.

For example, if `num2` is 10, then `ma` would be `int(10 / 2) - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit string converted to an integer, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`.**
