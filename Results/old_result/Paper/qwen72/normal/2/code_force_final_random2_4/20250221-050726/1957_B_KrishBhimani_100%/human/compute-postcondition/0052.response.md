Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `_` is incremented by 1, `temp` is now `temp * 2`. If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` is set to 2 and `temp` is set to 2. Otherwise, `i` is set to 1, `temp` remains 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
- If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` is set to 2 and `temp` is set to 2.
- Otherwise, `i` is set to 1, `temp` remains 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- All other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, `_`) remain unchanged.
