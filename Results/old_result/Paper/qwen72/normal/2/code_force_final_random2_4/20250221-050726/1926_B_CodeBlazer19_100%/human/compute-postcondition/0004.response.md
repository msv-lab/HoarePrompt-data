The code assigns an empty string to the variable `b`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `a`. Therefore, the output state remains the same for these variables, with the addition of the new value for `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string.**
