To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.
- `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`.
- `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1.
- `beautiful_count` is either 0 or the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` plus the previous value of `beautiful_count` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.
- `results` remains unchanged.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values of `case['params']`.
- `case` is now the next element in `test_cases`.
- `a` is a non-empty list.
- `num` is the second element of `a`.
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for num in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which is being iterated over the list `a`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `num` is the second element of `a`.
   - `a` is a non-empty list.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be set to the next element in the list `a`.
   - Since `num` is currently the second element, it will be set to the third element in the next iteration.

### Adjusted State:
- `num` is the third element of `a`.
- All other variables (`mod_y`, `mod_x`, `freq`, `beautiful_count`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `case`, `a`, `required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and are not directly modified by the loop itself.

### Final State:
State: **`mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`; `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1; `beautiful_count` is either 0 or the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` plus the previous value of `beautiful_count` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains unchanged; `results` remains unchanged; `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values of `case['params']`; `case` is now the next element in `test_cases`; `a` is a non-empty list; `num` is the third element of `a`; `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`; `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**
