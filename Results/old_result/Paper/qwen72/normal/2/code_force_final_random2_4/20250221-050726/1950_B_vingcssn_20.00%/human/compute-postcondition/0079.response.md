The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('..##..##')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'..##..##'` to the console. The initial state provides information about the variables `c`, `casos`, and `n`, but these variables do not affect the execution of the `print` statement because the `print` statement does not reference any of them. The string `'..##..##'` is a constant and will be printed as is.

Output: **..##..##**
