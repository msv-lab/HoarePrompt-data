To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `m` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is the second character of `s`.
   - If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s`, and `s2` is an empty string if the size of `alphabet` is not 1; otherwise, `s2` contains the first character of `s`.
   - The size of `alphabet` is `k-1` if it was not 1, otherwise it remains 1.
   - If `i` is not in `alphabet`, no changes are made to `s1`, `s2`, or `alphabet`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   s2 += i
   ```

3. **Impact Analysis:**
   - The code appends the second character of `s` (`i`) to the string `s2`.
   - This operation only affects `s2` if `i` is in `alphabet` and the conditions for `s2` being initialized are met.

4. **Output State Calculation:**
   - If `i` is in `alphabet`:
     - `s2` is updated to include the second character of `s`.
     - All other variables remain unchanged.
   - If `i` is not in `alphabet`:
     - No changes are made to `s1`, `s2`, or `alphabet`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `m` must be at least 1, `i` is the second character of `s`, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s`, `s2` is now a string containing the first character of `s` followed by the second character of `s` if the size of `alphabet` is not 1; otherwise, `s2` contains the first character of `s` followed by the second character of `s`. The size of `alphabet` is `k-1` if it was not 1, otherwise it remains 1. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, no changes are made to `s1`, `s2`, or `alphabet`.**
