### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is called in a loop for each test case, which is appropriate.
   - The function reads input for each test case and splits it into the required variables (`n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`).

2. **Initial Check for Draw:**
   - The first condition checks if `x2 <= x1`. If true, it prints "draw" and returns. This is correct because if Bob's chip is already in or above Alice's row, Alice cannot win since she moves down and Bob moves up.

3. **Odd Difference Case:**
   - If the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd, the function checks if `y1 == y2`. If true, it prints "Alice" and returns. This is correct because if the vertical distance is odd and the horizontal positions are the same, Alice can always move to Bob's position on her next turn.
   - If `y1 != y2`, the function adjusts `x1` and `y1` to simulate a move and checks again if `y1 == y2`. If true, it prints "Alice" and returns.
   - If `y1` and `y2` are still not equal, it calculates `a`, `b`, and `t` to determine if Alice can force a win. The logic here is complex but follows the rules of the game.

4. **Even Difference Case:**
   - If the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, the function checks if `y1 == y2`. If true, it prints "bob" and returns. This is correct because if the vertical distance is even and the horizontal positions are the same, Bob can always move to Alice's position on his next turn.
   - If `y1 != y2`, the function adjusts `x1` and `y1` to simulate a move and checks again if `y1 == y2`. If true, it prints "bob" and returns.
   - If `y1` and `y2` are still not equal, it calculates `a`, `b`, and `t` to determine if Bob can force a win. The logic here is complex but follows the rules of the game.

5. **General Draw Condition:**
   - If none of the above conditions result in a win for Alice or Bob, the function prints "draw" and returns. This is correct because if neither player can force a win, the game ends in a draw.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem description and follows the rules of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
