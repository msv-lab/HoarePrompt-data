### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Screen Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the initial number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. The formula used is:
     ```python
     t = b
     if t % 2 == 0:
         t = t // 2
     else:
         t = t // 2 + 1
     ```
     This formula is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells. Therefore, the number of screens required for `b` 2x2 icons is `b // 2` if `b` is even, and `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd. This ensures that the number of screens is always an integer and accounts for any leftover 2x2 icons.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The program then calculates the number of remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons:
     ```python
     t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
     ```
     Here, `t * 15` gives the total number of cells available in `t` screens, and `b * 4` gives the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons. This calculation is correct and accurately reflects the remaining cells.

4. **Check if Remaining Cells are Sufficient**:
   - The program checks if the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons:
     ```python
     if t1 >= a:
         t = t
     else:
         t2 = a - t1
         if t2 % 15 == 0:
             t = t + t2 // 15
         else:
             t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
     ```
     - If the remaining cells are sufficient (`t1 >= a`), the number of screens remains `t`.
     - If not, it calculates the additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons. The formula `t2 % 15 == 0` ensures that if the remaining cells are exactly divisible by 15, it adds the exact number of screens. Otherwise, it adds one extra screen to account for the remainder. This logic is correct and ensures that the minimum number of screens is used.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons and calculates the minimum number of screens required. The logic and calculations are sound and match the problem requirements.

Final: **True**
