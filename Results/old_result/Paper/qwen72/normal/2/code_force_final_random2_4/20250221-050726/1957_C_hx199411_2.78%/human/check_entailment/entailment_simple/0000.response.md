Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.

2. **Move Processing**: The program iterates through the `k` moves, updating the `num` variable based on whether the player's move and the computer's mirrored move occupy the same cell (`c == r`) or different cells (`c != r`). This part of the logic is correct because:
   - If `c == r`, only one rook is placed, so `num` is incremented by 1.
   - If `c != r`, two rooks are placed (one by the player and one by the computer), so `num` is incremented by 2.

3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The program calculates the number of possible final configurations using dynamic programming. The `dp` array is used to store the number of ways to place rooks on a board of size `m` (where `m = n - num`), considering the constraints of the problem. The initialization and update of the `dp` array are correct:
   - `dp[1] = 1`: There is only one way to place a rook on a 1x1 board.
   - `dp[2] = 3`: There are three ways to place rooks on a 2x2 board without attacking each other.
   - For `i >= 3`, the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used, which correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on a board of size `i` by considering the placement of the last rook and the remaining configurations.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the value of `dp[m]` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
