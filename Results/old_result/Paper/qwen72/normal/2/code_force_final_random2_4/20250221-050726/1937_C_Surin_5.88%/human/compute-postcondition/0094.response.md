Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `kp` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `r` is the user input. If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to 2. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`. Since the initial state does not specify any previous input being `<`, `v1` is 0.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `prev` depends on the value of `r`. If `r` is '>', `prev` is 2. Otherwise, `prev` is 0. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `r`, we need to consider both cases:
     - If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 2.
     - If `r` is not '>', then `prev` is 0.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - If `r` is '>', the print statement will be:
     ```python
     print(f'? {0} {3} {0} {2}')
     ```
     Output: **? 0 3 0 2**
   - If `r` is not '>', the print statement will be:
     ```python
     print(f'? {0} {3} {0} {0}')
     ```
     Output: **? 0 3 0 0**

Since the initial state does not specify the value of `r`, we need to consider both possible outputs. However, for the sake of providing a single, precise answer, we will assume the most common case where `r` is not specified or not '>', which is the default behavior.

Output: **? 0 3 0 0**
