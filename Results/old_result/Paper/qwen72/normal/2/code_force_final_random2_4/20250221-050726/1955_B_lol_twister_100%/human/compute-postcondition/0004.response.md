The code appends the value of `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. Given the initial state, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `k` is 0, and `h` is 0. Therefore, the expression simplifies to `a + 0 * c + 0 * d`, which is just `a`.

Since `li` was initially an empty list, after appending `a`, `li` will contain one element, which is `a`.

The values of `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, `k`, and `h` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing one element `a`, `k` is 0, `h` is 0**
