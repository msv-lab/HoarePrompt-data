The code snippet appends a new element to the list `suffZero`. This new element is calculated as the last element of `suffZero` plus the value of `i` plus 1. Given that `i` is `n - 3`, the new element appended to `suffZero` is `suffZero[-1] + (n - 3) + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`el` is the third-to-last character of `s1`, `i` is `n - 3`, `suffZero` has a new element which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 2`, all other variables remain unchanged.**
