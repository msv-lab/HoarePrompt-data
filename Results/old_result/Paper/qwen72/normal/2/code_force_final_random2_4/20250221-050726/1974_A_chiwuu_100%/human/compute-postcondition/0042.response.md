Output State: **`a` is an integer converted from its original string value, `b` is an integer (unchanged from its original integer value), `t` is updated as described, `t1` is updated as described, `t2` is updated as described, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `a` and `b` are now the integers parsed from the input string.**

Explanation:
- The line `b = int(b)` does not change the value of `b` because it is already an integer. Therefore, the state of `b` remains unchanged.
- All other conditions and variable states remain as they were in the initial state. The values of `a`, `t`, `t1`, `t2`, `i`, and `n` are not altered by the given code snippet.
