You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

The solution for the first test case can look as follows:

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. It then calculates a value `t` based on the following rules: if `b` is even, `t` is set to `b // 2`; if `b` is odd, `t` is set to `(b // 2) + 1`. It further adjusts `t` based on the difference between `a` and a calculated value `t1` (which is `t * 15 - b * 4`). If `t1` is less than `a`, `t` is incremented by the ceiling of the division of the difference `a - t1` by 15. Finally, the function prints the computed value of `t` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of screens required is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
2
```

The program incorrectly calculates the number of screens required. For the input `(1, 1)`, the program should output `1` because one 1x1 icon and one 2x2 icon can fit on a single screen. However, the program outputs `2`, indicating that it is not correctly handling the placement of icons.

The issue lies in the calculation of `t1` and the subsequent logic for adding additional screens. The program does not correctly account for the available space on the screen after placing the 2x2 icons, leading to an incorrect result.
