Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is 2, `a` is the first element in `l`, and `c` is 0. If `l[2] > l[1]`, then `b` is the third element in `l`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `b` remains 0.***
