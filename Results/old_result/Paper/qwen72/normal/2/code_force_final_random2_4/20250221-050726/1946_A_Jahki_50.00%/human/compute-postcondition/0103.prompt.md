You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the length of the array a. The array a consists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        
        case = input()
        
        op = 0
        
        if num2 > 10000:
            print(1)
            print(16668)
            break
        else:
            a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
            b = sorted(a)
            if num2 % 2 == 0:
                ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
            else:
                ma = int(num2 / 2)
            median = b[ma]
            new_median = median
            while new_median <= median:
                b[ma] += 1
                op += 1
                b = sorted(b)
                new_median = b[ma]
            print(op)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` remains an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` remains an array of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is the total number of test cases, `i` is equal to `num` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), `num2` is the last input integer, `case` is the last input string, and `op` is the total number of operations performed across all test cases. If any `num2` was greater than 10000, the loop would have broken early, but assuming it did not, `b` is the final sorted list of integers from the last `case`, `ma` is the index of the median in `b`, `median` is the original median value, and `new_median` is the final median value which is `median + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
