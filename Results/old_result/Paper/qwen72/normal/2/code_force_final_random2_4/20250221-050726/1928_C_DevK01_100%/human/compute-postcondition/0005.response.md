Output State: **q and x are integers such that 1 â‰¤ x < q â‰¤ 10^9, M is an empty list or contains the integer value of w if w is an integer and w is greater than or equal to x - 1, w is the square root of q, i is 1.** 

Explanation: The variable `i` is initialized to 1. The conditions and values of `q`, `x`, `M`, and `w` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only new information is that `i` is now 1.
