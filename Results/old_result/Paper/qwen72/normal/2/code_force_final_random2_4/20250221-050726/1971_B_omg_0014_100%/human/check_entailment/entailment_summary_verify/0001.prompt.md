You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000). For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. If the string `s` contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by either the string `s` sorted in descending order (if `s` is already sorted in ascending order) or the string `s` sorted in ascending order. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the final state includes the processed test cases and their respective outputs.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case.

2. **Set Creation and Uniqueness Check**: For each string `s`, it creates a set `a` from the characters of `s`. If the length of `a` is 1, it means all characters in `s` are the same, and thus it's impossible to rearrange `s` to form a different string. In this case, the function correctly prints 'NO'.

3. **Sorting and Reversing**: If the length of `a` is greater than 1, the function proceeds to sort the string `s` in both ascending and descending order. This is done using `b = ''.join(sorted(s))` and `c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))`.

4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - If the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`, it means sorting in ascending order did not change the string. In this case, the function prints the reversed string `c`.
   - If `b` is not equal to `s`, it means sorting in ascending order produced a different string, and the function prints `b`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For strings with all unique characters, the function will always produce a different string by sorting.
   - For strings with some repeated characters but not all the same, the function will also produce a different string by sorting or reversing.

6. **Output Format**: The function correctly outputs 'YES' followed by the rearranged string when a valid rearrangement is possible, and 'NO' when it is not.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly handles all the requirements and edge cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
