#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `password` remains a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The list `digits` contains all the digits from `password` in the order they appeared, and the list `letters` contains all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appeared.
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
        
    #State: `password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits from `password` in the order they appeared before sorting, `letters` is a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appeared before sorting, and `i` is `len(digits) - 1`. The loop has completed all iterations without returning False, meaning no digit in `digits` is greater than the next digit, and no digit in `digits` is greater than any letter in `letters` up to the last index of `digits`.
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if (sortedPassword == password) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a string `password` as input, which is expected to be between 1 and 20 characters long, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It separates the digits and letters from the password into two lists, sorts these lists, and then checks if the sorted combination of these lists matches the original password. The function returns `True` if the sorted combination of digits and letters is identical to the original password, indicating that the password is already in a non-decreasing order of digits followed by letters. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
