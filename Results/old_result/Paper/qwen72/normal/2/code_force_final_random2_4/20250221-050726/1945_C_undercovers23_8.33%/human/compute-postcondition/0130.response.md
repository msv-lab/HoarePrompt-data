Postcondition: ***`mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`, `lst` must contain at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, `final` is a list containing `[elem]` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in `lst` is not equal to `mini`; otherwise, `final` is a list containing `[first element in lst, elem]`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is not equal to `mini`, `final` remains unchanged (i.e., it is either an empty list or a list containing `[first element in lst]` if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in `lst` is equal to `mini`).***
