Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `i` is 0, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the corresponding bit in `x`. If `flag` is 1 and `s[0]` is '0', then `s[0]` is changed to '1' and `flag` is set to 0. Otherwise, the values of `x`, `t`, `nalla`, `length`, `i`, `s`, and `flag` remain unchanged. Additionally, `flag` is 0, `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]`, and both `s[i]` and `s[i + 1]` are '1'. Now, `s[i]` is '-1'.**
