The code snippet updates the variable `new_all` by evaluating whether all elements in the list `new` are in non-decreasing order. This is done by comparing each element with the next one in the list.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 1 (not used in the code)
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (not used in the code)
- `n` must be greater than 3 (used to define the range of the list `a`)
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input (used to create the list `new`)
- `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False` (not used in the code)
- `i` is 3 (not used in the code)
- `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 3 to the end of the list (used in the code)
- `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False` (not used in the code)
- `new_all` remains unchanged (will be updated by the code)

The code snippet:
```python
new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
```

This line of code checks if the list `new` is non-decreasing. It does this by iterating over the indices of `new` from 1 to `len(new) - 1` and checking if each element is less than or equal to the next element.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`, `i` is 3, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 3 to the end of the list, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.**
