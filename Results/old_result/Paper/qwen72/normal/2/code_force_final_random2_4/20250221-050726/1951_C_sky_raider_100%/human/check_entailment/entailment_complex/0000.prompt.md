ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

    10000 1 100 10 1000

    5 5 5 5 5 5

Output

    10

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), representing the number of sale days, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        l.sort()
        
        t = 0
        
        s = 0
        
        c = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            c += s * (l[i] + t)
            t += s
            k -= s
        
        print(int(c))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains the same as the initial value for each test case, `m` remains the same as the second integer read from the input for each test case, `k` is 0 or a non-negative integer less than the initial `k` depending on how many tickets were bought, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input for each test case, `t` is the total number of tickets bought, which is equal to the initial `k` or the maximum possible tickets that can be bought within the constraints, `s` is 0 or a non-negative integer less than or equal to `m` depending on the remaining `k` at the last iteration, and `c` is the total cost of buying the tickets, calculated as the sum of `s * (l[j] + t)` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of sale days (`n`), the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day (`m`), the number of tickets to be bought (`k`), and a list of ticket prices for each day (`a`). It calculates and prints the minimum total cost required to buy exactly `k` tickets over the `n` days, considering the constraints on daily purchases and ticket prices. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it prints the total cost for each test case. The final state includes `k` being reduced to 0 or a non-negative integer less than the initial `k`, `l` being a sorted list of ticket prices, and `c` holding the total cost of the tickets bought.
