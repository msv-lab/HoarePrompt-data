The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding the result of `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. Given that `b` is 3, the expression simplifies to `(n + 3) // 9`. The value of `ans` was initially `n + (n + 2) // 4`. After the update, `ans` becomes `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, `T`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers with `min(n, m) >= 3`, `t` is greater than 2, `T` is 2, `ans` is `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`, `b` is 3**
