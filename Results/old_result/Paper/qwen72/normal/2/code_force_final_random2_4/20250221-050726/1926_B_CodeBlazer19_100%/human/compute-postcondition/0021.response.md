The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1 (so `j` becomes 2) and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `s` is a new input string. If `s` contains exactly one '1' character, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' and `b` remains an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1' character, `a` remains 0 and `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1' characters, `a` remains 0 and `b` remains an empty string.**
