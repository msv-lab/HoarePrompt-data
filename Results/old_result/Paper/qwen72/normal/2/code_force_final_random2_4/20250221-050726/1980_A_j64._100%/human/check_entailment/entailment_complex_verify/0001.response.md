Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is verified by the loop `for _ in range(t)` which ensures that the program handles multiple test cases as specified.

2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, the program reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, followed by the string `a` representing the difficulties of the problems. This is done using the lines `(n, m) = map(int, input().split())` and `a = input()`, which correctly parse the input data.

3. **Counting Problem Difficulties**: The function `func_1` initializes a list `count` of size 7 to keep track of the number of problems for each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `count` list based on the character's position in the alphabet. This is achieved by the line `count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1`, which correctly maps each character to its respective index in the `count` list.

4. **Calculating Needed Problems**: The program then calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level. It does this by iterating over the `count` list and checking if the count of a particular difficulty level is less than `m`. If so, it adds the difference (`m - count[i]`) to `needed_problems`. This logic is implemented correctly in the loop `for i in range(7)` and the conditional `if count[i] < m`.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case. This is done by the line `print(func_1(n, m, a))`, which correctly outputs the result of the function call.

The logic and implementation of the program align with the problem description and constraints. The program correctly handles all aspects of the problem, including reading input, processing the data, and producing the correct output. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
