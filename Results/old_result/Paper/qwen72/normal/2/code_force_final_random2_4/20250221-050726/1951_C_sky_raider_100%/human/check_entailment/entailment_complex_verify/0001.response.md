### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and the list of ticket prices `l`.

2. **Sorting the Prices**:
   - Sorting the list of ticket prices `l` in ascending order is a crucial step. This ensures that the program always considers the cheapest available tickets first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Initialization**:
   - The variables `t`, `s`, and `c` are initialized to 0.
     - `t` keeps track of the total number of tickets purchased so far.
     - `s` represents the number of tickets to purchase on the current day.
     - `c` accumulates the total cost of purchasing tickets.

4. **Ticket Purchase Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over the sorted list of ticket prices.
   - For each day, the number of tickets to purchase `s` is set to the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets allowed per day) and `k` (the remaining tickets needed).
   - The cost `c` is updated by adding the product of `s` and the current day's price plus the total tickets purchased so far `t`.
   - The total tickets purchased `t` is incremented by `s`.
   - The remaining tickets needed `k` is decremented by `s`.

5. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the total cost `c` is printed for each test case.

### Validation Using Annotations:
- **Initial State**:
  - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
  - For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), \(1 \leq m \leq 10^9\), and \(1 \leq k \leq \min(nm, 10^9)\).
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).

- **Inside the Loop**:
  - `l` is sorted in ascending order.
  - `t` is initialized to 0.
  - `s` is initialized to 0.
  - `c` is initialized to 0.
  - For each day, `s` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k`.
  - The cost `c` is updated by adding `s * (l[i] + t)`.
  - `t` is incremented by `s`.
  - `k` is decremented by `s`.

- **Final State**:
  - After the loop, `k` is 0 or a non-negative integer less than the initial `k` depending on how many tickets were bought.
  - `l` is a sorted list of ticket prices.
  - `t` is the total number of tickets bought.
  - `c` is the total cost of buying the tickets.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
- The sorting of ticket prices ensures that the cheapest tickets are considered first, which is optimal for minimizing the total cost.
- The logic for updating the cost and the number of tickets purchased is sound and follows the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
The given program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.

Final: **True**
