Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `password` remains a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The list `digits` contains all the digits from `password` in the order they appeared, and the list `letters` contains all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appeared.**

This means that after the loop has completed its execution, the `digits` list will contain all the digit characters from the `password` string, and the `letters` list will contain all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the `password` string, each in the order they were encountered in the original string. The `password` string itself remains unchanged.
