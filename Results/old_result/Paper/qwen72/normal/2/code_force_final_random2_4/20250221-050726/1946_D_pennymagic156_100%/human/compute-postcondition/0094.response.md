To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `val` and `a`.

1. **`val`**: This variable will take on the value of each element in the list `a` during each iteration of the loop. It is not something we need to initialize or adjust before the loop starts; it will be automatically set by the loop.

2. **`a`**: This is the list over which the loop iterates. For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element. If `a` is empty, the loop will not run at all.

Given the initial state:
- `u` is 1
- `v` is even and non-zero
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\)
- `t` is an empty list
- `ans` is -1
- `i` is 28
- `op` is 0
- `cnt` is 0

The critical state for the loop to execute is that `a` must have at least one element. The other variables (`u`, `v`, `n`, `x`, `t`, `ans`, `i`, `op`, `cnt`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `a` is not empty. Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`u` is 1, `v` is even and non-zero, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `op` is 0, `cnt` is 0**
