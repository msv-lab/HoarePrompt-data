Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple (n, m, k, a, b) where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), k is even, a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), b is a list of m integers (1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6), `results` is an empty list, `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`.**
