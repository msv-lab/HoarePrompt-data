Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `T` is 0.
- `bets` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`.
- `i` is `bets - 1`.
- `sumo` is the sum of the integer values of the modified elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, where each element in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1` is now `prod // a[index]`.
- The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

Given the `print(-1)` statement, the output will be `-1`.

Explanation:
- The `print(-1)` statement simply prints the integer `-1`.
- The values of `t`, `T`, `bets`, `a`, `prod`, `i`, and `sumo` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

Output: **-1**
