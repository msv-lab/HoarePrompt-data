The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `expression`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `expression`. If there are more characters left in `expression`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `expression` is a string of length `length` consisting only of characters "+" and "-", and `count` is either 0 or 1 based on the first character of `expression`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `expression` needs to be considered. The length of `expression` remains the same, but the next character in the sequence will be assigned to `char`.

Since the loop iterates over each character in `expression`, the next character in the sequence will be the next one in the string. The value of `count` does not change as it is not part of the loop head and is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` consisting only of characters "+" and "-", `count` is 0 if the first character of `expression` is "-", otherwise `count` is 1 if the first character of `expression` is "+", `char` is the next character in `expression`**.
