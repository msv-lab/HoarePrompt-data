The code snippet `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes input from the user, splits it into multiple parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`.

- `_` remains 0.
- `m` must be greater than 2 (unchanged).
- `a3` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `l3` is assigned a list of the remaining integers from the input.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.**
