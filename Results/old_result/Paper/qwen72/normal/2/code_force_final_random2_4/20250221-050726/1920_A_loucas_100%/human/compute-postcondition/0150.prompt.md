Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has constraints (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `loop` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for iterable in range(loop):
    less = []
    big = []
    no = []
    num = 0
    innerLoop = int(input())
    for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
        x, a = map(int, input().split())
        if x == 1:
            big.append(a)
        elif x == 2:
            less.append(a)
        else:
            no.append(a)
    num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
    if num < 1:
        print(0)
        continue
    for i in no:
        if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
            num -= 1
    print(num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has constraints (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is the last integer from the input, `a` is the last integer from the input, `big` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 2, `no` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 3, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - k` where `k` is the number of elements in `no` that satisfy the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is the last integer from the input, `a` is the last integer from the input, `big` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 2, `no` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 3, and `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - count`, where `count` is the number of elements in `no` that satisfy the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an input integer greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is the last integer from the input, `a` is the last integer from the input, `big` contains all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` contains all `a` values where `x` was 2, `no` contains elements that were not 1 or 2, and `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - k`, where `k` is the number of elements in `no` that satisfy the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`. If `num` is less than 1, the loop skips the current iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
