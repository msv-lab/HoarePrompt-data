The code snippet `a.reverse()` reverses the order of elements in the list `a`. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input.**
