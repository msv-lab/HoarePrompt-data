You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is equal to the initial value of `w` (an integer), `_` is `w - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`, `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple sets of inputs from the standard input. Each set starts with an integer `w` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `ln` representing the number of sticks, followed by a list of stick lengths. It then calculates and prints the number of unique stick lengths that appear at least three times in the list for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. After the function completes, the input variables `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `d`, and `shapes` will have been modified according to the processing of the inputs, but their final states are not retained outside the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `w`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `ln` and the lengths of the sticks into a list `palka`.

2. **Frequency Counting:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `d` to count the frequency of each stick length.
   - It also maintains a list `pl` to keep track of unique stick lengths.

3. **Shape Calculation:**
   - The program iterates over the unique stick lengths in `pl`.
   - For each unique stick length, it checks if there are at least 3 sticks of that length (`if d[j] >= 3`).
   - If so, it increments the `shapes` counter by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of shapes that can be formed for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Shape Calculation:**
  - The program assumes that if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length, a shape can be formed. However, this is not always correct. For example, if there are 4 sticks of length 3, a square can be formed, but the program will only count it as one shape.
  - The correct approach should consider the number of sides required for a regular polygon. For example, if there are 6 sticks of length 3, two triangles can be formed, or one hexagon can be formed.

### Correct Approach:
- For each unique stick length, calculate the maximum number of polygons that can be formed by dividing the number of sticks by the number of sides required for a polygon (starting from 3 sides).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
        shapes = 0
        for j in d:
            for sides in range(3, d[j] + 1):
                shapes += d[j] // sides
        print(shapes)
```
