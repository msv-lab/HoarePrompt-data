Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of finding the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the logic implemented in the program does not correctly address the condition specified in the problem statement.

The key issue lies in the calculation of `ans` within the loop:
```python
for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
    ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
```
This calculation does not reflect the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be an arbitrary formula that does not align with the problem's requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check if \(a + b\) is divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This involves computing the greatest common divisor (gcd) for each pair and checking the divisibility condition.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
