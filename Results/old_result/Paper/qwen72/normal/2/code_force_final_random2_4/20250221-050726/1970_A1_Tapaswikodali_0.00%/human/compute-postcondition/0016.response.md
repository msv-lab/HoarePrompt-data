The value of `balance` is incremented by 1. Since `balance` was initially 3 if `char` is '(', or -3 if `char` is ')', the new value of `balance` will be 4 if `char` is '(', or -2 if `char` is ')'. The `details` list remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it should be a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000, `i` is 2, `char` is the third character in `s`. If `char` is '(', `balance` is 4. If `char` is ')', `balance` is -2. `details` is a list containing the tuples `(balance, 0, char)`, `(balance, -1, char)`, and `(balance, -2, char)`**
