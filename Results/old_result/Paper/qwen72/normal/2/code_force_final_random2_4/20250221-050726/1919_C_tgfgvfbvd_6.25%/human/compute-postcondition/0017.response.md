Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is the first integer in the list `l`, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `c` is 0, `y` is 3, `b` is set to `l[3]`. If `l[1]` is greater than `l[0]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
