Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `m` is exactly 2.
   - `val` is an empty list.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `a1` is assigned the first integer from the user input.
   - `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input.
   - `a2` is assigned the first integer from a new user input.
   - `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input.
   - `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`.
   - `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.
   - `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions encountered during the loop.
   - `idx1` is `n - 2`.
   - If `idx2` is `n - 2`, the condition `idx1 == -1 and idx2 != -1` is no longer true.
   - Additionally, `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`.
   - The condition `idx1 > idx2` is false, meaning `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - `idx1` is `n - 2`.
   - `idx2` is also `n - 2` (since the condition `idx1 == -1 and idx2 != -1` is no longer true).
   - `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`.
   - `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.

Given these conditions, we can deduce:
- Since `idx1` and `idx2` are both `n - 2`, they are equal.
- Therefore, `idx1` is equal to `idx2`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('yes')
```

This statement will always print the string `'yes'` regardless of the values of the variables and lists described in the initial state.

Output: **yes**
