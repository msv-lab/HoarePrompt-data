Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is `0`.
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `n` is not equal to `k`.
   - `n` is less than `k`.
   - `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n + 0`.
   - `i` is `1`.
   - `curr` is `0`.
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Analyzing the Variables:**
   - Since `n` is `0`, the expression `n - k + 1` becomes `-k + 1`.
   - Therefore, `costs` is `[-k + 1, 1]`.
   - The expression `n // (n - k + 1)` simplifies to `0 // (-k + 1)`, which is `0` because `0` divided by any non-zero number is `0`.
   - Thus, `h` is `0 // (-k + 1) + 0 + 0`, which simplifies to `0`.
   - However, the condition states that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`. This implies that there might be an error in the initial state or the condition is not consistent with the given values.

3. **Resolving the Inconsistency:**
   - Given that `h` must be greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is a positive integer, `h` cannot be `0` if `k` is positive.
   - Therefore, the initial state and the condition `h` is greater than or equal to `k` are contradictory.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Despite the contradiction, the code snippet provided is simply `print('YES')`.
   - The print statement will execute regardless of the initial state and conditions, and it will print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
