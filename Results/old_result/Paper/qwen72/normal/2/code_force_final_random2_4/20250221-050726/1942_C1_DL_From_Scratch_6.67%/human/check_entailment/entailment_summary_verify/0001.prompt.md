You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = n - list0[-1]
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. It then calculates the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive elements in the sorted list, plus the number of gaps of size 1 between the last element and `n`. The function prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program includes the original values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the processed results have been printed to the standard output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a regular polygon with `n` sides.
   - Bessie has chosen `x` vertices.
   - We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the chosen vertices.
   - The value of `y` is always 0, meaning we cannot choose any additional vertices.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - To form a triangle, we need three vertices.
   - The vertices chosen by Bessie are given in a list, and we need to sort them to understand their relative positions.
   - The number of triangles formed by a set of vertices is related to the gaps between consecutive vertices.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0).
   - It reads the list of chosen vertices and sorts them.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It iterates through the sorted list of vertices and calculates the gaps between consecutive vertices.
     - If the gap is exactly 1, it increments the `count` by 1.
   - After the loop, it checks the gap between the last vertex and the first vertex (considering the polygon is cyclic).
     - If the gap is exactly 1, it increments the `count` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints the total count of triangles plus `x - 2`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the gaps between consecutive vertices.
   - It correctly handles the cyclic nature of the polygon by checking the gap between the last and first vertices.
   - The formula `count + x - 2` is used to calculate the maximum number of triangles. This formula is derived from the fact that each set of three consecutive vertices forms a triangle, and the number of such sets is `x - 2` plus the number of gaps of size 1.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `x` is 2 or 3 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the polygon is fully covered by the chosen vertices (i.e., `x = n`).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly counts the number of triangles that can be formed using the given vertices and the gaps between them.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
