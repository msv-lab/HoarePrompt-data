Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` (where 1 â‰¤ x < 2^30), converts `x` into a binary string representation, processes this binary string according to specific rules, and prints the length of the resulting string and the string itself. The processing involves converting certain sequences of '1's and '0's into special characters ('-1'), and then resolving these characters to ensure the final string meets the specified conditions. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but it prints the results for each test case. **
