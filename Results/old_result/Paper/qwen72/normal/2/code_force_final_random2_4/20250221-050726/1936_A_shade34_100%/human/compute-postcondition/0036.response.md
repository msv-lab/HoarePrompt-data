The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that all data written to `stdout` is immediately written to the terminal or file. This operation does not alter any of the variables in the current state.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `s` is a string input by the user. If `s` is `<`, `pans` is `[0]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0]`. Otherwise, `pans` is an empty list.**
