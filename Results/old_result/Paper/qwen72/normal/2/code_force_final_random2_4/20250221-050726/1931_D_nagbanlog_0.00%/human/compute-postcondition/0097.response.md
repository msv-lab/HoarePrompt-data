Output State: **`freq` is an empty dictionary `{}`, `beautiful_count` is 0, `results` remains unchanged, `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values of `case['params']`, `case` is now the next element in `test_cases`, `a` is a non-empty list, `num` is the first element of `a`, `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`.**

Explanation:
- `mod_x` is calculated as the remainder of `num` divided by `x`.
- All other variables (`freq`, `beautiful_count`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `case`, `a`, `t`, `test_cases`) retain their values from the initial state.
