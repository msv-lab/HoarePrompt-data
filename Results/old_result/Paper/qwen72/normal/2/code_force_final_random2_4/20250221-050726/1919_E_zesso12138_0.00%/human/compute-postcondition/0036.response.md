Functionality: ** The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results of processing each test case. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers, which are the sorted prefix sums of a hidden array. The function calls another function `func_1` with `n` and `p` as arguments and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. **
