Postcondition: ***`_` is 1, `n` is a new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is `n + 1`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `pans` is a list with at least `n + 2` elements. If the user input is `>`, then `mak` is set to `n + 1`. If the user input is not `>`, the variables retain their original values.***
