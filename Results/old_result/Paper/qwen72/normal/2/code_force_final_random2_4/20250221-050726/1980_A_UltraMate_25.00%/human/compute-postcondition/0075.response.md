Postcondition: ***`t` is `t - 2`, `n` and `m` are the new input integers, `s` is the new input string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the new input string `s`, `i` is 'C'. If `i` (which is 'C') is not in `hmp`, then `ans` is set to `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
