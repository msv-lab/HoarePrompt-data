Postcondition: ***`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `i` is 29, and the bit at position 29 in `x` (`u`) is 1. If `v` is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop, and `ans` remains -1. If `v` is even, `ans` is updated to the maximum of the previous value of `ans` (-1) and `cnt`, where `cnt` is the number of elements in `a` whose 30th bit contributes to making `op` (the XOR of the 30th bits of all elements in `a`) equal to 0.***
