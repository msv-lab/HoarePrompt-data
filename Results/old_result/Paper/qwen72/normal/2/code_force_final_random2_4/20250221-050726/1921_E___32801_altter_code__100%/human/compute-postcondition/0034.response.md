Postcondition: ***`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, if `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3] + 1` and `a` is `r[5] - 1`, otherwise if `y1` is less than `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3] - 1` and `a` is `r[1] - r[5]`, `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, which is an odd number, `t` is `abs(r[5] - y1)`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.***
