The code snippet `result = ' '.join(map(str, a))` converts each element of the list `a` to a string and joins them into a single string separated by spaces. This operation does not change the values of `i`, `n`, or the elements of `a`. However, it introduces a new variable `result` which holds the string representation of the elements of `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` remains unchanged
- `a` has `n` elements, and the elements of `a` are reversed as described.

After executing the code, the output state is:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` remains unchanged
- `a` has `n` elements, and the elements of `a` are reversed as described.
- `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.

For example, if `n` is 4, and `a` is `[998, 999, 1000, 1000]` (assuming `T` values lead to these results), then `result` would be `"998 999 1000 1000"`.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` has `n` elements and the elements of `a` are reversed as described, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.**
