The code snippet `results.append('yes')` adds the string `'yes'` to the list `results`.

Given the initial state:
- `start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`.
- The current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, and each of these subfolders may contain .html files.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `results` is a list.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is an input string.
- The number of '1's in `arr` is even.
- `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of `arr`.
- If `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of `arr`, then `results` remains an empty list.

After executing the code snippet, the list `results` now contains the string `'yes'`.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, and each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes', `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, the number of '1's in `arr` is even, `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's or '11' is not a substring of `arr`.**
