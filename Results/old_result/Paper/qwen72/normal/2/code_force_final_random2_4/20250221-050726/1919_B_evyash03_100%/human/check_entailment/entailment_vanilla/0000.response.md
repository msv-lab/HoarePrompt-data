Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: A string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-'.
2. **Array Conversion**: Convert the string `s` to an array `a` where `a[i] = 1` if `s[i] = '+'` and `a[i] = -1` if `s[i] = '-'`.
3. **Penalty Calculation**: The goal is to split the array `a` into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
4. **Optimal Splitting**: The optimal way to split the array is to ensure that each subarray has a sum of zero, which minimizes the penalty for that subarray.

### Given Solution Analysis:
The function `func_1` is defined as follows:
```python
def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            count += 1
    sub = length - count
    return abs(sub - count)
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Counting '+' and '-'**:
   - The variable `count` is used to count the number of '+' characters in the string `expression`.
   - The variable `sub` is calculated as `length - count`, which represents the number of '-' characters in the string.

2. **Calculating the Penalty**:
   - The function returns `abs(sub - count)`, which is the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters.

### Correctness Check:
- **Optimal Splitting**: The optimal way to minimize the penalty is to split the array into subarrays with a sum of zero. However, the given function does not explicitly perform any splitting. Instead, it calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters.
- **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty for a subarray with a sum of zero is zero. If the number of '+' and '-' characters is equal, the total penalty is zero. If they are not equal, the penalty is the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters.

### Example Verification:
- **Test Case 1**: `s = "+"`
  - `count = 1`, `sub = 0`
  - `abs(0 - 1) = 1`
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `s = "-----"`
  - `count = 0`, `sub = 5`
  - `abs(5 - 0) = 5`
  - Output: `5` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `s = "+-+-+ among others"`
  - `count = 3`, `sub = 3`
  - `abs(3 - 3) = 0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**: `s = "--+++++++-"`
  - `count = 8`, `sub = 2`
  - `abs(2 - 8) = 6`
  - Output: `6` (Incorrect, should be `4`)

- **Test Case 5**: `s = "+---++++-+++++---++-"`
  - `count = 10`, `sub = 10`
  - `abs(10 - 10) = 0`
  - Output: `0` (Incorrect, should be `4`)

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle all test cases. Specifically, it fails to account for the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
