The code `a, b = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts using whitespace as the delimiter, and assigns these parts to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, `x` and `y` are integers within a certain range, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. After executing the code, the values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged, while `a` and `b` are now strings representing the input values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are strings from user input.**
