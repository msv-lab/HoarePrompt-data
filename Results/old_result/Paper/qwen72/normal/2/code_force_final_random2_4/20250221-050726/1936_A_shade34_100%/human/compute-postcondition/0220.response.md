Functionality: **The function operates without explicit parameters but interacts with a system to query bitwise OR results of elements from a hidden permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. It aims to find a pair of indices (i, j) that maximize the bitwise XOR of the elements at those indices, using at most 3n queries. The function handles multiple test cases, each with a different permutation of size n, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.**
