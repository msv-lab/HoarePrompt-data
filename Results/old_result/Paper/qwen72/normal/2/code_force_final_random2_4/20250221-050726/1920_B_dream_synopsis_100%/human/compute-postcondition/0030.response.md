Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 1, `x` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is 2, `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `ans` is a list containing the values `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and `i` with their respective values.
- The code snippet updates `sums` to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- Since `i` is 2 (which is not 0), the condition for updating `ans` is checked. However, the code snippet only updates `sums` and does not extend `ans` yet.
- Therefore, `ans` is initialized as a list containing the single value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
