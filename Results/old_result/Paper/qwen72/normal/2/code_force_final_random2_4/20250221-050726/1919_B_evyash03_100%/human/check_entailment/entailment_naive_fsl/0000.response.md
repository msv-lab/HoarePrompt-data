Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters and returns the absolute value of this difference. However, this approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
+-+-+-
```
The correct output should be `0` because the array can be split into `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])`, and the penalty for each subarray is `0`. However, the provided program will output `6` because it simply calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is `|3 - 3| = 0`, and then multiplies it by the length of the string, resulting in `6`.

This shows that the program does not handle the problem as specified and thus is incorrect.
