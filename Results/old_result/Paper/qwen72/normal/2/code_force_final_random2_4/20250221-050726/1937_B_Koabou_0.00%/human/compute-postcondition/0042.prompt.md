Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is either the string formed by concatenating the substring of `a[0]` up to the position where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met with the rest of `a[1]`, or it is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]` if the condition is never met, `x` is the index where the condition is met or `n-1` if the condition is never met.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
        t = x - i + 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is a string formed based on certain conditions, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0. If the first character of `a[0]` matches the first character of `s`, then `t` is updated to `x + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is a string formed based on certain conditions, `x` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the first `i + 1` characters of `a[0]` match the first `i + 1` characters of `s`, then `t` is updated to `x`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is a string formed based on certain conditions, `x` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]`, then `t` is updated to `x - 1` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without changing `t`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
