To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 2 (this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is a new user-provided integer.
- `k` is a new user-provided integer and must be non-negative.
- `x` is a new user-provided integer.
- `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input.
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop.

### Loop Logic:
1. The first element of `ans` is initialized as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
2. For each subsequent element in `ans`:
   - If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
   - Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the reversed list `a`.
   - The first element of `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.

2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - For each `i` from 1 to `k`:
     - If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, update `sums` to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
     - Otherwise, update `sums` to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

3. **Final Output:**
   - The `max(ans)` function will find the maximum value in the list `ans`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the following values for the variables:
- `n = 5`
- `k = 2`
- `x = 2`
- `a = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` (reversed list)

1. **Initialization:**
   - `sum1 = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15`
   - First element of `ans`: `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) = 15 - 2 * (5 + 4) = 15 - 18 = -3`

2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - For `i = 1`:
     - `i + x - 1 = 1 + 2 - 1 = 2 < n`
     - `sums = -3 + a[0] - 2 * a[2] = -3 + 5 - 2 * 3 = -3 + 5 - 6 = -4`
   - For `i = 2`:
     - `i + x - 1 = 2 + 2 - 1 = 3 < n`
     - `sums = -4 + a[1] - 2 * a[3] = -4 + 4 - 2 * 2 = -4 + 4 - 4 = -4`

3. **List `ans`:**
   - `ans = [-3, -4, -4]`

4. **Maximum Value:**
   - `max(ans) = -3`

### Final Output:
Output: **-3 (where -3 is the maximum value in the list `ans`)**

This output is based on the specific example values provided. In general, the output will be the maximum value in the list `ans` calculated according to the given conditions.
