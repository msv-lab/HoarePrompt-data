To determine what will be printed by the `print(dp[m])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **`t`**: An integer input by the user, which must be greater than 0. This variable is decremented by 1 in each iteration of a loop, and the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0.
2. **`n` and `k`**: Integers input by the user, where `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
3. **`i`**: Set to `k - 1`.
4. **`c` and `r`**: The last integers input by the user.
5. **`num`**: Incremented by 1 if `c` equals `r`, or by 2 if `c` does not equal `r`.
6. **`m`**: Calculated as `n - num`, and must be greater than or equal to 3.
7. **`dp`**: A list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros. The specific values are:
   - `dp[1]` is 1.
   - `dp[2]` is 3.
   - For each `i` from 3 to `m`, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % 10`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `dp` is initialized as a list of zeros of length `m + 1`.
   - `dp[1]` is set to 1.
   - `dp[2]` is set to 3.

2. **Dynamic Programming Update**:
   - For each `i` from 3 to `m`, the value of `dp[i]` is updated using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \% 10
     \]

3. **Final Value**:
   - The value of `dp[m]` is the result of the dynamic programming calculation up to index `m`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume some example values to illustrate the process:
- Suppose `n = 10`, `k = 5`, `c = 1`, `r = 2`.
- `num` is incremented by 2 because `c` does not equal `r`.
- Therefore, `m = n - num = 10 - 2 = 8`.

Now, we need to compute `dp` up to `m = 8`:
- `dp[1] = 1`
- `dp[2] = 3`
- `dp[3] = (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1]) % 10 = (3 + 2 * 1) % 10 = 5`
- `dp[4] = (dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % 10 = (5 + 3 * 3 * 2) % 10 = (5 + 18) % 10 = 3`
- `dp[5] = (dp[4] + 4 * dp[3] * 2) % 10 = (3 + 4 * 5 * 2) % 10 = (3 + 40) % 10 = 3`
- `dp[6] = (dp[5] + 5 * dp[4] * 2) % 10 = (3 + 5 * 3 * 2) % 10 = (3 + 30) % 10 = 3`
- `dp[7] = (dp[6] + 6 * dp[5] * 2) % 10 = (3 + 6 * 3 * 2) % 10 = (3 + 36) % 10 = 9`
- `dp[8] = (dp[7] + 7 * dp[6] * 2) % 10 = (9 + 7 * 3 * 2) % 10 = (9 + 42) % 10 = 1`

Thus, `dp[8]` is 1.

### Final Output:
The `print(dp[m])` statement will print the value of `dp[m]` after the dynamic programming calculation.
Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the value computed by the dynamic programming formula for the given m)**

In the example provided, the output would be:
Output: **1**
