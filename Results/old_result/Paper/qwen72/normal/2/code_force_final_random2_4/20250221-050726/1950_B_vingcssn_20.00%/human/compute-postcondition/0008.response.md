The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('##..')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'##..'` to the console.
- The initial state provides information about variables such as `c`, `casos`, `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
- The string `'##..'` is a fixed literal and does not depend on any variables or conditions.

### Output:
Output: **##..**
