Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \) and `k > 1`.
   - `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `cnt` is `k - 2`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - `l < n + 1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists. Since `i` is 3, `v` will be 1 unless there is a specific condition where `i` equals `n`, but this is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, `v` is 1.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`. The function `func_2()` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `l < n + 1`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
   ```

4. **Substituting the Values:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `v` is 1.
   - `i * v` is `3 * 1` which is 3.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`, but since `func_2()` is not defined, we represent it as `func_2() + 1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
```python
? func_2() + 1 3
```

However, since `func_2()` is not defined, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for `l`. The output will be:

Output: **? func_2() + 1 3**
