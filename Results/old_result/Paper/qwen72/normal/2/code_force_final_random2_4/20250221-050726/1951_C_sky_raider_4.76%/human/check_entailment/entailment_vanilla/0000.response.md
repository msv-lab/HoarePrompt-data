### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the list of ticket prices for each day and sorts it in ascending order.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `s` is initialized to 0.
   - `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`. This initialization seems incorrect because `c` should be initialized to 0 to accumulate the total cost.

3. **Ticket Purchase Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over the sorted list of prices.
   - In each iteration, it calculates the number of tickets to buy (`s`) as the minimum of `m` and `k`.
   - It subtracts `s` from `k` to update the remaining number of tickets to be bought.
   - It updates the total cost `c` by adding the cost of buying `s` tickets at the current price `l[i]` and subtracting `s * s / 2`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the total cost `c` for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Initialization of `c`:**
  - `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`, which is incorrect. It should be initialized to 0.
- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The formula `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is incorrect. The term `- s * s / 2` is unnecessary and incorrect. The correct formula should be `c += l[i] * s`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        c = 0
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l[i] * s
            if k == 0:
                break
        print(c)
```

### Explanation of Corrections:
- **Initialization of `c`:**
  - `c` is now correctly initialized to 0.
- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The cost calculation is simplified to `c += l[i] * s`, which correctly adds the cost of buying `s` tickets at the current price `l[i]`.
- **Early Termination:**
  - The loop breaks early if `k` becomes 0, which optimizes the program by stopping once all tickets are purchased.

### Final Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program has issues with the initialization of `c` and the cost calculation formula. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly.
