You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function operates in an environment where it can interactively query a system to compare bitwise OR results of elements from a hidden permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, and it must find a pair of indices (i, j) that maximize the bitwise XOR of the elements at those indices, using at most 3n queries. The function handles multiple test cases, each with a different permutation of size n, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

    #State: _ is equal to the number of test cases minus 1, `n` is the input positive integer for the last test case, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<`. The loop has completed all its iterations, and the output buffer has been flushed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Element:**
   - The variable `mak` is initialized to 0.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `n-1` to find the index `mak` such that `p_mak` is the maximum element in the permutation.
   - For each index `i`, it queries `? mak mak i i` to compare `p_mak` with `p_i`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `mak` to `i`.

3. **Finding the Second Maximum Element:**
   - The variable `mak2` is set to `mak`.
   - A list `pans` is initialized to store potential candidates for the second maximum element.
   - The loop iterates over all indices `i` to find indices that are greater than or equal to `p_mak`.
   - For each index `i`, it queries `? mak mak2 i mak2` to compare `p_i` with `p_mak2`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `mak` to `i` and sets `pans` to `[i]`.
   - If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `pans`.

4. **Finding the Maximum XOR Pair:**
   - The variable `mak` is reset to 0.
   - The loop iterates over the list `pans` to find the index `pans[mak]` such that `p_pans[mak]` is the maximum element in `pans`.
   - For each index `i` in `pans`, it queries `? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[i] pans[i]` to compare `p_pans[mak]` with `p_pans[i]`.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `mak` to `i`.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The function prints the indices `mak2` and `pans[mak]` as the answer.
   - It ensures that the output is flushed to avoid the Idleness Limit Exceeded error.

### Correctness:
The program correctly follows the problem's requirements and constraints. It uses the allowed number of queries to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized. The logic for finding the maximum and second maximum elements, and then the maximum XOR pair, is sound and aligns with the problem's constraints.

**Correctness: **True****
