Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is `l[x]`, `c` is 0, `x` is `y + 1`, and the current value of `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`. Additionally, `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated to `l[x]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `y`, `a`, `c`, `x`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions regarding `l[x]` being greater than `a` and `b`, and `l[x] - a < l[x] - b` still hold true.
