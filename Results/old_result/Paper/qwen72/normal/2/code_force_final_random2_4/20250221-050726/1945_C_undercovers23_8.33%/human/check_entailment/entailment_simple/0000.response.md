### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `s` representing the preferences of the residents.
   - It initializes `pk` to the middle index of the houses, which is used to find the optimal position closest to the middle.

2. **Counting Zeros and Ones:**
   - The program converts the string `s` to a list `sl` and counts the total number of '1's (`o`) and '0's (`z`).

3. **Iterating Through Possible Positions:**
   - The program iterates through possible positions `i` (from 0 to `n-2`) to check if placing the road after house `i` satisfies the conditions.
   - It keeps track of the number of '0's (`zero`) and '1's (`one`) encountered up to position `i`.

4. **Calculating Percentages:**
   - It calculates the percentage of '0's on the left side (`zero_perc`) and the percentage of '1's on the right side (`one_perc`).
   - If both percentages are at least 50%, the position `i + 1` is added to the list `lst`.

5. **Finding the Optimal Position:**
   - The program finds the position in `lst` that is closest to the middle index `pk`.
   - If no valid positions are found, it checks the overall satisfaction of the residents and outputs 0 or `n` accordingly.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the optimal position for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output as specified, and the logic for finding the optimal position is sound. The use of percentages and the conditions to check the satisfaction of residents are appropriate.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
