Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, and each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` is the total number of iterations, `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, and `results` contains `t` elements, each of which is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions described in the initial state. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's and does not contain exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, 'yes' is added to `results`. Otherwise, 'no' is added to `results`.**
