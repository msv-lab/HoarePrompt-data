Postcondition: ***`s` is a new input binary string with a length of 2 to 500 characters, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, `count` is the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in `s`, and `flag` is True if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1' in `s`. If there is no transition from '0' to '1', `flag` remains False.***
