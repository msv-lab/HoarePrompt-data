Let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is 0.
- `s` is a string input by the user.
  - If `s` is `<`, `pans` is `[0]`.
  - If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0]`.
  - Otherwise, `pans` is an empty list.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will print the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` separated by spaces.
- From the initial state:
  - `mak` is 0.
  - `mak2` is 0.
  - `i` is 1.
  - `mak2` is 0 (repeated).

### Output:
The print statement will print the string `'?'` followed by the values 0, 0, 1, and 0.

Output: **? 0 0 1 0**
