The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `nodes` representing a tree structure, an integer `start` indicating the starting node, and an optional integer `parent` indicating the parent node (or None if there is no parent). It checks if the starting node is a leaf node with no other connections except to its parent. If so, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it recursively checks the same condition for all adjacent nodes that are not the parent. The function returns `True` if any of these recursive calls return `False`, indicating that at least one adjacent node is not a leaf node. If all adjacent nodes are leaf nodes, it returns `False`. In essence, the function determines whether the starting node or any of its children (excluding the parent) have more than one connection.
