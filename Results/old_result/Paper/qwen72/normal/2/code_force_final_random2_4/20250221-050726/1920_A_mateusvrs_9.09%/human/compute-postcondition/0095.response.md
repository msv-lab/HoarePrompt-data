The value of `tmp` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `tmp` is either 1 or 2 based on the conditions given in the initial state. Therefore, after the increment, `tmp` will be either 2 or 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `bx` is the maximum value encountered among all `x` values where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value encountered among all `x` values where `a` was 2, `cx` is a non-empty list of unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is the third element in `cx`, if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 3. Otherwise, `tmp` is 2.**
