Output State: **`m` is greater than 2, `val` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 1, `a1` is assigned the first integer from the user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `a2` is assigned the first integer from the new user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions encountered during the loop, `idx1` is `n - 2`. If `idx2` is `n - 2`, the condition `idx1 == -1 and idx2 != -1` is no longer true. Additionally, `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`. The condition `idx1 > idx2` is false, meaning `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. `a3` is assigned the first integer from the new user input, and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input.**
