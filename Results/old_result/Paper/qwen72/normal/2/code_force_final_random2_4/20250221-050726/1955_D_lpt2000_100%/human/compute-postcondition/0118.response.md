Output State: **`fnd` remains the same or is incremented by 1 depending on the condition, `D`, `E`, `C`, `m`, and `n` remain the same, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa]` > 0, and `E[out_aa]` > 0, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` > 0 and `E[out_aa]` <= 0, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` <= 0, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. Additionally, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.**
