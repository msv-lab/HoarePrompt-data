To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).
   - `x` is 5.
   - `y` is 2.
   - `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\). If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 30, m // 6)`.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as both \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\) are true.
   - Given `x = 5` and `y = 2`, we need to check:
     - \((5 + 2) * 5 = 7 * 5 = 35\)
     - \((5 + 2) * 2 = 7 * 2 = 14\)

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must still hold true.
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 35 and `m` must be at least 14.

### Conclusion:
Since the current values of `x` and `y` are fixed, and the loop condition depends on `n` and `m`, we need to ensure that `n` and `m` satisfy the conditions for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` must be at least 35, `m` must be at least 14, `x` is 5, `y` is 2, and `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\). If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by `min(n // 30, m // 6)`.**
