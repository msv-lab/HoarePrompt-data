Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is the final profit calculated after processing all elements in `combined`, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit observed during the loop execution.**

Explanation:
- The code `prices = list(func_2())` assigns the list returned by `func_2()` to the variable `prices`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The initial state specifies that `prices` should contain the values returned by `func_2()`, which is now explicitly true after the code execution.
- The negation of the elements in `prices` (stored in `neg_prices`) and the other lists (`bonuses`, `combined`, etc.) are not affected by this code snippet.
