The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 5 to 6. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, `i` is 6, `x` is a new random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive), `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive). If `x` < `y` and `y` > `z`, `res` is 'peak'. If `x` < `y` and `y` < `z`, `res` is 'stair'. If `x` < `y` and `y` == `z`, `res` is 'none'. If `x` >= `y`, `res` is 'none'.**
