Output State: **`n` remains `new_n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj` is a list of lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` in the input, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` in the input. `t`, `z`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged based on the initial conditions. `numCuts` is now 0, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, and `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call. `R` is now equal to `(L + R) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `R` is updated to be equal to `x`, which is `(L + R) // 2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `adj`, `t`, `z`, `L`, `numCuts`, `x`, and `leftover`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
