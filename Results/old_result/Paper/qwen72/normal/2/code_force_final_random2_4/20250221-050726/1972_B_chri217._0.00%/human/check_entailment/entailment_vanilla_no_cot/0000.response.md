Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins. The logic implemented in `func_1` checks if the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins is odd. If it is, Alice wins because she starts first and an odd number of facing-up coins means she will always have the last move. If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob wins because after Alice's turn, the number of facing-up coins will become odd, giving Bob the last move. This aligns with the problem statement and the examples provided. Therefore, the program is correct.
