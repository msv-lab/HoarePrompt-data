Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, and each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` is the total number of iterations, `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, and `results` contains `t` elements, each of which is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions described in the initial state. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's and does not contain exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, 'yes' is added to `results`. Otherwise, 'no' is added to `results`.
Code of the loop:
for r in results:
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, and each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` is the total number of iterations and must be at least 1, `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, and `results` contains `t` elements, each of which is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions described in the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, and each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` is the total number of iterations and must be at least 1, `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, and `results` contains `t` elements, each of which is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions described in the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, representing the range of folder names to be processed, the current working directory contains subfolders named with digits within the specified range, and each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` is the total number of iterations and must be at least 1, `i` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, and `results` contains `t` elements, each of which is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions described in the initial state. The loop is processing the last element in `results`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
