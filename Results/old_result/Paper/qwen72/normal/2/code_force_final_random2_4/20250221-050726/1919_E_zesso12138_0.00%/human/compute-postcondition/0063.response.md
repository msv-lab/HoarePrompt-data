Postcondition: ***`n` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is still a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1, `offset` is still equal to `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1 initialized to all zeros, and `j` is 0. If `dp[j] > 0` and `j - 1 >= 0`, an `IndexError` is raised due to accessing `new_dp[-1]`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
