The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, this value must be at least 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, representing the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2.

To ensure the loop executes, the input value must be at least 1. Since `t` represents the number of test cases, and the loop is iterating over these test cases, the input value should be equal to `t`.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and `int(input())` must be equal to `t`**
