Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `k` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 0, `x` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the values `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]), sums]`, `sums` is now `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `i` is 1, and `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to execute again.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(sums)` adds the value of `sums` to the list `ans`.
- Before the code execution, `ans` already contained the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- After the code execution, `ans` now contains two elements: the original value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and the new value `sums`, which is also `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
