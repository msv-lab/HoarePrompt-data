Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \).
- `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `i` is 3.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and `l < n + 1`.
- Additionally, `cnt` is 0 and `l` is equal to `n + 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.

2. **Value of `v`:**
   - According to the initial state, `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
   - Since `i` is 3, we need to check if `v` equals `n`.
   - If `v` does not equal `n`, then `v` is set to 1.
   - Given the initial state, it is not specified that `v` equals `n`, so `v` must be 1.

3. **Value of `l`:**
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and it is also given that `l < n + 1`.
   - Additionally, it is stated that `l` is equal to `n + 1`.
   - This seems contradictory, but we should consider the last statement as the definitive one. Therefore, `l` is `n + 1`.

4. **Value of `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is explicitly given as 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Calculation:
- `i` is 3.
- `v` is 1.
- Therefore, `i * v` is \( 3 * 1 = 3 \).

### Final Output:
The code will print the string `! 3` with the `flush=True` parameter ensuring immediate output.

Output: **! 3**
