Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the new `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` updates the value of `s` to a new input string. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new value of `s` is now the input string provided by the user.
