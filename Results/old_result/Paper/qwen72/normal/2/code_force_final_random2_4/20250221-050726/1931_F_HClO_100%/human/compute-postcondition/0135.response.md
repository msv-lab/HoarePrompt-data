Postcondition: ***`_` is `m-2`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` will be set by the last tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing at least `m-2` tuples, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer. If `m` is 1, one line of input has been consumed and the current iteration of the loop ends immediately.***
