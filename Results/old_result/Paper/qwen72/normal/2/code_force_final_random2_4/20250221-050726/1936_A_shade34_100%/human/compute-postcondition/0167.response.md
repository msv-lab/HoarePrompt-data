Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.
- The code snippet `pans = []` reassigns `pans` to an empty list.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `i`, `mak`, `mak2`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
