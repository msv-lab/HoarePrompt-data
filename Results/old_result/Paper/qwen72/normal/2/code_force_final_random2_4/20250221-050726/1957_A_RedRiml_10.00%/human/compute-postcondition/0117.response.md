The code snippet `shapes += 1` increments the value of `shapes` by 1. Based on the initial state, `shapes` is initially set to 1 if `d[j]` (where `j` is the second element in `pl`) is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise, `shapes` is 0. After executing the code, the value of `shapes` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` and must have at least 2 elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`, `j` is the second element in `pl`, `shapes` is 1 if `d[j]` is less than 3, otherwise `shapes` is 2.**
