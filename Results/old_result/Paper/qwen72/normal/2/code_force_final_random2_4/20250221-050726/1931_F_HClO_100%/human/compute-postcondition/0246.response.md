Output State: **`m` is greater than 2, `val` contains `m-2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, `a3` is the first integer from the input for the first iteration, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input for the first iteration, `val` is no longer an empty list but contains `m-2` elements, and the list `l3` is not equal to the list `[i for i in l if i != a3]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
