Postcondition: ***`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition `b <= a` holds true. If `b` is greater than `a`, the condition `b > a` holds true. In both cases, `k` remains the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.***
