Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is the final profit calculated after processing all elements in `combined`, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit observed during the loop execution.**

Explanation: The code snippet `remaining_items = []` reassigns `remaining_items` to an empty list. Since `remaining_items` was already an empty list in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
