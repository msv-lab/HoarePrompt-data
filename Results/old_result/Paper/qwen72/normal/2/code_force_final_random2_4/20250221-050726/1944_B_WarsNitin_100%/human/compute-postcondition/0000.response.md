Output State: **t is an input integer between 1 and 5000, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 50000, 1 ≤ k ≤ floor(n/2)), and a list a of 2n integers (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n) where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 50000.**
