The value of `tot` is incremented by 1, from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition about breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`num` is a string representation of the original integer value of `num` and has at least 3 characters, `i` is `len(num) - 3`, `tot` is 3. If `num[i]` is not '0', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
