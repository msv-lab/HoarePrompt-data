The code appends the value `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. Given that `h` is 2, the value being appended is `a + k * c + d * 2`.

Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is 2, `li` now has `2n + 2` elements. The first `n` elements of `li` are `[a, a + d, a + 2 * d, ..., a + (n-1) * d]`, the next `n-1` elements are `[a + (n-1) * c + d * 0, a + (n-1) * c + d * 1, a + (n-1) * c + d * 2, ..., a + (n-1) * c + d * (n-2)]`, the second to last element is `a + k * c`, the last element before the append is `a + k * c + d`, and the new last element is `a + k * c + d * 2`.**
