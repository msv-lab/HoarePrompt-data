Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 1, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`, `v2` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to `v2`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `v2` is now 1, and the rest of the initial state remains the same.
