Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the input array has repeated maximum values, which can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the logic in `func_5` that tries to find the largest value `m` by iterating through possible values of `i` and checking if the subarrays can be formed with the required properties is flawed. The program assumes that the maximum value `v` found in the initial loop is sufficient to determine the subarrays, but this may not always be the case, especially when the array has repeated maximum values or when the subarrays need to be split in a more complex manner.

For example, consider the following test case:
- `n = 6`, `k = 3`, and the hidden array is `[1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1]`.

The program might incorrectly determine the value of `m` because it does not properly account for the repeated maximum values in the array. The correct value of `m` in this case should be `6` (since the array can be split into `[1, 3, 3]`, `[1, 2]`, and `[1]`), but the program might not find this split due to its flawed logic.
