Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to hold `m` rounds, where each round requires one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. 

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, followed by the string `a` representing the difficulties of the existing problems.

2. **Counting Existing Problems**: The function `func_1` initializes a list `count` of length 7 to zero, which will store the count of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `count` for each character.

3. **Calculating Needed Problems**: The function then calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level. If the count of any difficulty level is less than `m`, the difference (`m - count[i]`) is added to `needed_problems`.

4. **Output**: The function returns the total number of additional problems needed, which is printed for each test case.

The logic and implementation appear to be correct and align with the problem requirements. The execution summary confirms that the function behaves as expected, counting the necessary additional problems and returning the correct result.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
