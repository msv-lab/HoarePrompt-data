Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is `n // k`, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l < n + 1`. Additionally, either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`. The loop will have printed `! {i * v}` where `i` is the last value of `i` before the loop terminates.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n // k`.
- For each iteration, `cnt` starts at `k` and decreases to 0.
- `l` is updated based on the result of `func_2() + 1` and must be less than `n + 1` for the loop to continue.
- When `cnt` reaches 0 and `l` equals `n + 1`, the loop prints `! {i * v}` and calls `func_2()` before returning.
- After all iterations, `i` will be `n // k`, `cnt` will be 0, and `l` will be `func_2() + 1` (which is less than `n + 1`).
- The final output will include the value `! {i * v}` where `i` is the last value of `i` before the loop terminates.
