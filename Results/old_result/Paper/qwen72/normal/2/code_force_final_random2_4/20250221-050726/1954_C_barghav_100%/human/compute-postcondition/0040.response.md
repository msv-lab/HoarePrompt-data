Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `x` is a string representing an integer where \(1 \leq x < 10^{100}\) and consists only of digits from 1 to 9.
- `y` is a string representing an integer where \(1 \leq y < 10^{100}\) and consists only of digits from 1 to 9.
- `a` and `b` are lists of characters from the input strings `x` and `y`, respectively.
- `f` is 1.
- `i` is the length of `a` (which must be at least 2).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end='')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Length of `a`**: The variable `i` is defined as the length of the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of characters from the string `x`, and `x` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 with a length of at least 2, `i` will be at least 2.
2. **Indexing `a`**: The `print` statement attempts to access `a[i]`. However, in Python, list indices are zero-based, meaning the last valid index for a list of length `i` is `i-1`. Therefore, `a[i]` will always be out of bounds because it tries to access an index that does not exist.

### Conclusion:
Since `a[i]` is out of bounds, attempting to access it will raise an `IndexError`. Therefore, the code will not print anything and will instead raise an error.

Output: **IndexError (out of bounds access)**

However, if we assume the code is intended to print the last character of the list `a`, we should correct the index to `a[i-1]`.

### Corrected Output:
If the code were corrected to:
```python
print(a[i-1], end='')
```
Then the output would be the last character of the list `a`.

Output: **last character of the list `a` (which is the last digit of the string `x`)**

But since the original code is as given, the output will be:

Output: **IndexError (out of bounds access)**
