Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `t` is an integer input by the user, `nodes` is a defaultdict with at least one key-value pair remaining, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is `n-1`, `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers provided by the user, `key` is the next key in the `nodes` dictionary, `leaves` is a deque containing the new key from the `nodes` dictionary.** 

The code `leaves.append(key)` adds the value of `key` to the deque `leaves`. All other variables remain unchanged.
