To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the formula used to compute `ans`.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are integers converted from their original string representations.
- `min(n, m) >= 2` ensures that the minimum of `n` and `m` is at least 2.
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the computation of `ans`).
- `T` is 0 (though `T` is not used in the computation of `ans`).

### Formula for `ans`:
\[ \text{ans} = n + \sum_{b=2}^{\min(n, m)} \left( \frac{n + b}{b^2} \right) \]

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` and `m` are integers.
   - `min(n, m)` is the smaller of `n` and `m`, and it is at least 2.
   - `ans` starts with the value of `n`.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum is computed over the range from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1` (inclusive).
   - For each `b` in this range, the term \(\frac{n + b}{b^2}\) is added to `ans`.

3. **Final Value of `ans`**:
   - The final value of `ans` is the sum of `n` and the sum of the terms \(\frac{n + b}{b^2}\) for each `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n = 5` and `m = 3`:
- `min(n, m) = 3`
- The range for `b` is from 2 to 3.

\[ \text{ans} = 5 + \left( \frac{5 + 2}{2^2} + \frac{5 + 3}{3^2} \right) \]
\[ \text{ans} = 5 + \left( \frac{7}{4} + \frac{8}{9} \right) \]
\[ \text{ans} = 5 + (1.75 + 0.8888888888888888) \]
\[ \text{ans} = 5 + 2.6388888888888887 \]
\[ \text{ans} \approx 7.638888888888889 \]

### General Output:
Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given formula.

Output: **ans (where ans is the value of n plus the sum of (n + b) / (b * b) for b in the range from 2 to min(n, m))**
