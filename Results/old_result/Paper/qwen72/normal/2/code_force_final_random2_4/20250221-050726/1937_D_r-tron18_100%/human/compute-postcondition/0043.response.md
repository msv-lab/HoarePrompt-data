Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the second-to-last character of `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`**. 

Explanation: The variable `oneInd` is assigned the value of the function `func_1` applied to `preOne` at index `zr` plus the value of `func_1` applied to `preOne` at index `zr + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
