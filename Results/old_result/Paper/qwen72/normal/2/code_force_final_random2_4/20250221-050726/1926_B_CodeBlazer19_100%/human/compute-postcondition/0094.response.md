Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `a` is 0.
- `b` is 'SQUARE' if any input string `s` had more than one '1', otherwise `b` is an empty string.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `b` is determined based on the input string `s`.
- If the input string `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is set to 'SQUARE'.
- Otherwise, `b` is set to an empty string.

### Output:
- The `print(b)` statement will print the value of `b`.

### Final Output:
- If the input string `s` contains more than one '1', the output will be:
  Output: **SQUARE**
- If the input string `s` does not contain more than one '1', the output will be:
  Output: **'' (an empty string)**

To summarize, the output depends on the content of the input string `s`:
- If `s` has more than one '1': Output: **SQUARE**
- If `s` has one or no '1': Output: **'' (an empty string)**
