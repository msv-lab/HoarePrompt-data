Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `t` is an integer input by the user, `nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing adjacent nodes, `start` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ start â‰¤ n, `edges` is an empty list.** 

The code initializes an empty list named `edges`. All other variables (`n`, `t`, `nodes`, and `start`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
