The code snippet reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the string into a list of substrings based on spaces, and then converts each substring into an integer, storing the result in the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the remainder of `t * (2`
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `T` remains unchanged and must be greater than the current value of `_`
- `n` is an integer read from input
- `k` is an integer read from input

After executing the code snippet:
- `a` is now a list of integers, where each integer is derived from the input line.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the remainder of `t * (2`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` remains unchanged and must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line.**
