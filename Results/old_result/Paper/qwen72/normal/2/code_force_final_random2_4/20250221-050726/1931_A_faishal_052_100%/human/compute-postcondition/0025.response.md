The code `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the list `arr`. Let's consider the different cases for `lex`:

- If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` was initially `[1]`. After appending 26, `arr` becomes `[1, 26]`.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` was initially `[26]`. After appending 26, `arr` becomes `[26, 26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 51 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` was initially `[26]`. After appending 26, `arr` becomes `[26, 26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` was initially an empty list `[]`. After appending 26, `arr` becomes `[26]`.

The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer, `arr` is `[1, 26]` if `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is `[26, 26]` if `lex` is between 28 and 78 (inclusive), and `arr` is `[26]` if `lex` is greater than 78.**
