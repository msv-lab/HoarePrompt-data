Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and `k` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. If `n` < `k`, the condition holds true. If `n` ≥ `k`, the condition holds true if `n` = `k` or if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. If neither of these conditions hold, `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`.***
