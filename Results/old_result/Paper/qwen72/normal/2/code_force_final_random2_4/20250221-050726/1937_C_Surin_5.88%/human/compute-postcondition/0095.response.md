Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` is 3, `r` is the user input, and `prev` is 0 or 2 depending on the user input.** 

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call does not change any of the variables in the initial state. It only ensures that any buffered output is written to the terminal immediately. Therefore, all the initial state variables remain unchanged.
