Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for excursions, considering that the friendship value of a chosen pair increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions. The final answer should be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function processes the friendship data and calculates the expected sum of friendship values.
     - It iterates over each friendship tuple `(a, b, f)` and adds `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` to the result.
     - The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` correctly calculates the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which represents the cumulative increase in friendship value over `k` excursions.
     - The result is taken modulo `MOD` to ensure it fits within the required constraints.
   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function handles multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the friendship data.
     - It calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.
     - The function correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem statement.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `m = 0` (no friendships), the function correctly returns `0` because there are no friendship values to consider.
   - The function handles large values of `n`, `m`, and `k` efficiently, as required by the problem constraints.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The use of `MOD` ensures that the result remains within the bounds of a 32-bit integer, as required by the problem constraints.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The logic in both functions aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The input and output handling is correct and follows the specified format.
   - The mathematical calculations are accurate and efficient.

Based on the above reasoning, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
