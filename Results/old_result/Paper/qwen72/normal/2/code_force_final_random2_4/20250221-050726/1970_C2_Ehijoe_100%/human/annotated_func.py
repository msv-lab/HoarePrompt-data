#State of the program right berfore the function call: nodes is a dictionary representing a tree where keys are node identifiers and values are lists of adjacent node identifiers, start is an integer representing the starting node identifier, and parent is an optional integer representing the parent node identifier (or None if there is no parent).
def func_1(nodes, start, parent):

    #State: nodes is a dictionary representing a tree where keys are node identifiers and values are lists of adjacent node identifiers, start is an integer representing the starting node identifier, and parent is an optional integer representing the parent node identifier (or None if there is no parent). Additionally, either the length of the list of adjacent nodes for the start node is not 1, or the single adjacent node is not equal to the parent node.

    for node in nodes[start]:
        if node != parent:
            distances.append(not func_1(nodes, node, start))
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `nodes` remains a dictionary where `nodes[start]` is a list of adjacent node identifiers. `start` is still the starting node identifier, and `parent` is still the parent node identifier (or None if there was no parent). The `distances` list contains boolean values, each being the result of `not func_1(nodes, node, start)` for each `node` in `nodes[start]` that is not equal to `parent`. The number of boolean values in `distances` is equal to the number of adjacent nodes in `nodes[start]` that are not equal to `parent`.
    return any(distances)
    #The program returns True if any of the boolean values in the `distances` list is True, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `nodes` representing a tree structure, an integer `start` indicating the starting node, and an optional integer `parent` indicating the parent node (or None if there is no parent). It checks if the starting node is a leaf node with no other connections except to its parent. If so, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it recursively checks the same condition for all adjacent nodes that are not the parent. The function returns `True` if any of these recursive calls return `False`, indicating that at least one adjacent node is not a leaf node. If all adjacent nodes are leaf nodes, it returns `False`. In essence, the function determines whether the starting node or any of its children (excluding the parent) have more than one connection.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer equal to 1, nodes is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing adjacent nodes, and start is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n.

If `moves` is not empty, `moves` contains at least one element. If `moves` is empty, `moves` is False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and an integer `t` from user input, constructs a graph represented by a dictionary `nodes` where each key is a node and its value is a list of adjacent nodes, identifies leaf nodes (nodes with only one connection), reads a starting node `start` from user input, and calls another function `func_1` with the graph and the starting node. Based on the result of `func_1`, it prints either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `t` are the integers input by the user, `nodes` is a dictionary representing the graph, `start` is the starting node input by the user, `leaves` is a deque containing all leaf nodes, and `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`.
