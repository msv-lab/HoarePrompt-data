### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, reading the string `s` for each case. This part is handled correctly.

2. **String Rearrangement**:
   - The program uses `random.sample(s, len(s))` to generate a random permutation of the string `s`. This function returns a new list containing all elements from `s` in a random order, which is then joined back into a string `s2`. This approach is appropriate for generating a random permutation of the string.

3. **Comparison and Output**:
   - If `s2` is different from `s`, the program prints "Yes" followed by `s2`.
   - If `s2` is the same as `s`, the program prints "No".
   - This logic is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For strings with all identical characters (e.g., "aaaaa"), the program will always print "No" because any permutation of such a string will be the same as the original. This is correct.
   - For strings with at least two different characters, the program has a high probability of generating a different permutation, but it is not guaranteed to always find one due to the randomness. However, the problem statement does not require a guarantee of finding a different permutation; it only requires that if a different permutation is found, it should be printed.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The problem statement specifies that "YES" and "NO" should be outputted in any case (e.g., "yEs", "yes", "Yes"). The program currently outputs "Yes" and "No" in a specific case, which is generally acceptable. However, to be strictly correct, the program could use `print('YES')` and `print('NO')` to ensure case insensitivity.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in terms of logic and functionality. It handles the edge cases appropriately and follows the problem statement's requirements. The minor issue with the case sensitivity of "YES" and "NO" is not a significant concern given the problem's flexibility in accepting any case.

Final: **True**
