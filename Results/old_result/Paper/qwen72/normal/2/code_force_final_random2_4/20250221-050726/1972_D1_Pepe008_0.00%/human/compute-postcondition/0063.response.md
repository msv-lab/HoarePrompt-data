The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints given, it is implied that the function should accept two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are both positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. The output section is not provided, so I cannot determine the specific return value or behavior of the function based on the inputs. Without additional information about the output, I can only describe the parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are both positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6.**
