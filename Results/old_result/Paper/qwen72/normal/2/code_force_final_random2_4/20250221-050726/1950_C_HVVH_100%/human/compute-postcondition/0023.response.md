The value of `h` is decremented by 12. Since `h` is the integer value of the hour part of the new input, after the decrement, `h` will be `h - 12`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` must be greater than 1, `h` is the integer value of the hour part of the new input minus 12, `m` is the integer value of the minute part of the new input, `day` remains 'AM'.**
