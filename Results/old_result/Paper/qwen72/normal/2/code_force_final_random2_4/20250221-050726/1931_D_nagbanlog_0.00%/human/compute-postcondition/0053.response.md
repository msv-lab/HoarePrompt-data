The code snippet `mod_x = num % x` calculates the remainder when `num` is divided by `x` and assigns this value to `mod_x`. Since `num` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific value. However, we know that `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`.

Output State: **`freq` is an empty dictionary, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing one element which is `beautiful_count`, `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a non-empty list, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`.**
