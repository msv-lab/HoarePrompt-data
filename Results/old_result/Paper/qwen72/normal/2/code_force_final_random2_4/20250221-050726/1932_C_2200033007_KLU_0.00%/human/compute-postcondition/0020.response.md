The code snippet `b.append(a[r])` appends the element at index `r` of list `a` to the list `b`. This operation modifies the list `b` by adding a new element, but does not change the value of `r` or any other variables.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` now contains one additional element from `a` at index `l-1`, and `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `b` has one additional element which is `a[r+1]`, and `r` is `r - 1`.

After executing the code snippet:
- The list `b` has one additional element, which is `a[r]`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `s`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `b` has one additional element which is `a[r]`, `s` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `r` is unchanged.**
