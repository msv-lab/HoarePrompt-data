Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `T` is an integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 and `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line that must have at least 1 element, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `tmp` is now equal to the first element in the list `a`, `x` is the first element in the list `a`, and the current value of `tmp` is less than 0.**
