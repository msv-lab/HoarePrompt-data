Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 3 and must be greater than -1, `a` is a list with the first element being `-1000000000.0`, followed by `t + 2` values returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, `b` will contain `t + 2` elements, where each element is calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions specified in the loop, `u` is zero, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations, the values of `c` and `d` are the final values returned by the function `r()` during the last iteration of the loop, if the final `c` is less than the final `d`, the current value of `c` is less than the current value of `d`, otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.**
