The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the first part to `n` and the second part to `k`, converting both to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code).
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `int(input())` must be equal to `t`.

After executing the code:
- `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split into two integers.
- The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.**
