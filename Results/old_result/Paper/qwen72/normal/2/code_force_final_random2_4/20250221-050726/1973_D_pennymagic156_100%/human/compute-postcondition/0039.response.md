The function `func_2()` is called, but since there's no definition provided for `func_2()`, we cannot determine its exact behavior or the value it returns. However, based on the initial state, we know that `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1`, and it is also stated that `l` is equal to `n + 1`. This implies that `func_2()` must return `n`.

Since `func_2()` is called, it does not change any of the variables directly in the provided code snippet. The values of `n`, `k`, `v`, `i`, `cnt`, and `l` remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `n + 1`.**
