Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of screens required is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
2
```

The program incorrectly calculates the number of screens required. For the input `(1, 1)`, the program should output `1` because one 1x1 icon and one 2x2 icon can fit on a single screen. However, the program outputs `2`, indicating that it is not correctly handling the placement of icons.

The issue lies in the calculation of `t1` and the subsequent logic for adding additional screens. The program does not correctly account for the available space on the screen after placing the 2x2 icons, leading to an incorrect result.
