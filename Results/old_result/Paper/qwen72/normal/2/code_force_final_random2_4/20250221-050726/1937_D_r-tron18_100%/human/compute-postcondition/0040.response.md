To solve this, let's break down the code and its impact on the variables:

- `oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`

Given the initial state:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5.
- `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0.
- `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `el` is the second-to-last character of `s1`.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`preOne[-1]`**: This is the last element of the `preOne` list, which represents the cumulative sum of all indices of '>' characters in `s1`. Since `preOne` starts with an initial value of 0, `preOne[-1]` is the sum of all indices of '>' characters in `s1`.

2. **`func_1(preOne, 1)`**: This function call is not explicitly defined, but it is assumed to return some value based on the list `preOne` and the argument `1`. Without the definition of `func_1`, we cannot compute the exact value, but we can represent it symbolically.

3. **`oneInd` Calculation**:
   - `oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`
   - `preOne[-1]` is the sum of all indices of '>' characters in `s1`.
   - `func_1(preOne, 1)` is some value computed from `preOne` and `1`.

### Updated Variables:
- `oneInd` is now calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.

### Unchanged Variables:
- `s1` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5.
- `pre` remains a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` remains the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` remains a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0.
- `suffZero` remains a list initialized with a single element 0.
- `ans` remains a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0.
- `i` remains `n - 2`.
- `el` remains the second-to-last character of `s1`.
- `ol` remains `totalOne`.
- `zr` remains `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `zeroInd` remains `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.

### Output State:
**`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the second-to-last character of `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.**
