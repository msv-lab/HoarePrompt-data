To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `pans`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `len(pans)` is greater than 1. This is because `range(1, len(pans))` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to (but not including) `len(pans)`. If `len(pans)` is less than or equal to 1, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

### Adjusting the States:
- **`pans`**: For the loop to execute, `pans` must have at least 2 elements. This ensures that `len(pans)` is greater than 1.
- **`i`**: The variable `i` is controlled by the loop and will start at 1. We do not need to adjust `i` manually.

### Final State:
Given the initial state:
- `_` is 0
- `n` is the input positive integer
- `i` is `n-1`
- `mak` is 0
- `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`
- `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<`

We need to ensure that `pans` has at least 2 elements for the loop to execute.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is the input positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 2 elements**
