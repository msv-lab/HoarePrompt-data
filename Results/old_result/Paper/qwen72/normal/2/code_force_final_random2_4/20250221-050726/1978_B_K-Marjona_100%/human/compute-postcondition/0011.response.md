Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a * n)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement multiplies the value of `a` by the value of `n`.
- Since `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `a` is an input integer, the result of `a * n` will be the product of these two values.

### Output:
The code will print the product of `a` and `n`.
Output: **a * n (where a is the input integer and n is the input integer greater than 0)**
