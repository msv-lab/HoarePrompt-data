The code snippet `dp = new_dp` updates the `dp` list to be the same as the `new_dp` list. This means that the values in `dp` are now the updated values from `new_dp` after the transitions have been applied.

Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is still a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is now a list of length 2 * n + 1 with values updated from `new_dp`, `offset` is still equal to `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1, and `j` is 2 * n.**
