Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic implemented in the function `func()` calculates the sum of the floor division of the count of each unique element by 3. This approach does not consider the game dynamics, the optimal play strategy, or the interaction between the two players' moves. Specifically, it fails to account for the fact that Nene will play optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours, which is a crucial part of the problem statement.

To solve this problem correctly, one would need to simulate the game considering the optimal strategies of both players, which involves more complex logic than simply counting occurrences of numbers and dividing by 3. The correct solution should involve tracking the state of the game (which cards are on the table, which cards each player has, etc.) and making decisions based on the current state and the rules of the game.
