Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where `adj[a]` now contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the specific integers read from the input, `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` before the loop terminates, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L <= 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `adj[b].append(a)` adds the integer `a` to the list `adj[b]`.
- This means that `adj[b]` now contains `[a]` in addition to any other elements it might have had.
- All other variables remain unchanged, so their initial states are still valid.
