The code `pl.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is the first element of the list `palka`) to the list `pl`. This changes the state of `pl` from being an empty list to a list containing the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` (the first element in `palka`) and its value is 1, the current value of `i` is the first element of `palka` and is now in the list `pl`.**
