Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Default Value Function**: The `defaultdict` is initialized with a reference to a function `default_value`, but this function is never defined. Instead, the program defines a function `func_1` which returns `0`. However, `func_1` is not used in the `defaultdict` initialization. This will cause a `NameError` when the program runs.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Missing Problems**: The logic for calculating the number of missing problems is incorrect. The program checks if the count of each difficulty level is less than or equal to `m` and then adds `m - d[val]` to the answer. This is incorrect because it should check if the count of each difficulty level is less than `m` and then add `m - d[val]` to the answer. The current logic will incorrectly add `0` when the count is exactly `m`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version initializes the `defaultdict` with `int` (which defaults to `0`) and correctly calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level.
