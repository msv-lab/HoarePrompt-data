The code appends the value of `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Let's break down the impact:

- `ans` initially contains the value \((2^i - 1)\).
- `sum(ans)` is the sum of the elements in `ans`, which is \((2^i - 1)\).
- `k - sum(ans)` calculates the difference between `k` and \((2^i - 1)\).

Therefore, the new value appended to `ans` is `k - (2^i - 1)`, which simplifies to `k - 2^i + 1`.

The updated state of the variables is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `l1` is a list of strings from the input.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- `arr` is an empty list.
- `k0` is equal to `k`.
- `ans` now contains the values \((2^i - 1)\) and \((k - 2^i + 1)\).
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`.
- `temp` is \(2^i\).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values \((2^i - 1)\) and \((k - 2^i + 1)\), `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`, `temp` is \(2^i\).**
