Postcondition: **start and end are integers where start <= end, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (no specific state), `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. Additionally, `cnt1` is either less than or equal to 2, or `cnt1` is even.**
