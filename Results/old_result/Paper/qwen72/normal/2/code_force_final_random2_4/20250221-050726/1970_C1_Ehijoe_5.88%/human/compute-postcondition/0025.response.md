Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `i` is 0, `u` is an input integer, and `v` is an input integer. If `empty` is True, `tree` is a deque containing `[u, v]`, and `empty` is False. If `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque, and `empty` is False. If `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `[u]`. Otherwise, if `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `[u]` and `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` has `v` as its first element, and `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `[u, v]`. If `u` is neither the first nor the last element of `tree`, then `tree` remains unchanged.***
