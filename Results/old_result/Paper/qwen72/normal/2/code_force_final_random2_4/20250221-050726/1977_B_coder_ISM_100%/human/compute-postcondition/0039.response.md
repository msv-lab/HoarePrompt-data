Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on whether the corresponding bit in `x` (from the least significant bit to the most significant bit) is set (1) or not set (0). If `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is '0', then `s[1]` is '1' and `flag` is 0. Otherwise, `s[0]` remains '0', `flag` remains 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.***
