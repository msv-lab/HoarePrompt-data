Postcondition: ***`_` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` is at least 2, `s` is the value of `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains the value of `p[b - 1]`. Additionally, either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1, or `s` is less than 2 times `(b - a + 1)`.***
