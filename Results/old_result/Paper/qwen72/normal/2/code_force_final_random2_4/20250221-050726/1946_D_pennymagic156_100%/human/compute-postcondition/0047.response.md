Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 1 element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 1, `v` is even, `op` is the XOR of the 30th bit of `val` and the original `op`, `cnt` is 1 if the original `op` was 0, otherwise `cnt` remains 0, `val` is the next element in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- `op ^= val >> i & 1`: This line updates `op` by performing an XOR operation between the current value of `op` and the 30th bit of `val` (since `i` is 29, `val >> i & 1` extracts the 30th bit).
- All other variables (`n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
