The code snippet `pref += soma_b` updates the value of `pref` by adding the value of `soma_b` to it. Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `pref` or `soma_b`, we can only say that `pref` is now the sum of its previous value and `soma_b`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_B` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and `lista_B` is in its original order, `lista_A` is a list of integers provided by the user input and has been reversed, `n - k` must be greater than 2, the relationship between the first elements of `lista_A` and `lista_B` is preserved (either `lista_A[0] < lista_B[0]` or `lista_A[0] >= lista_B[0]`), `pref` is updated to `pref + soma_b`.**
