Reasoning:

The program correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, including the special cases for 00:00 and 12:00. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program starts by reading an integer `n`, which represents the number of test cases. This is consistent with the problem statement.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, the program reads a time in the format "hh:mm" and splits it into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).

3. **Handling the Hour Conversion**:
   - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'. This correctly handles the 00:00 case.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'. This correctly handles the PM hours.
   - If `h` is 12, it sets `day` to 'PM'. This correctly handles the 12:00 PM case.
   - Otherwise, it sets `day` to 'AM'. This correctly handles the AM hours.

4. **Formatting and Printing the Output**: The program uses formatted string literals to print the time in the 12-hour format with leading zeros for hours and minutes, followed by the AM/PM indicator.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases such as 00:00 (which should be 12:00 AM), 12:00 (which should be 12:00 PM), and other boundary conditions.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality and handle all specified cases.

Correctness: **True**
