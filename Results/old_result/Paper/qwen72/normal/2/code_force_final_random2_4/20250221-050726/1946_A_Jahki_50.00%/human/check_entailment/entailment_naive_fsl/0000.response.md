Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Handling of Input Size**: The program checks if `num2` (the length of the array) is greater than 10000 and prints a fixed value if true. This is incorrect because the problem does not specify any special handling for large input sizes, and the solution should work for all valid input sizes (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

2. **Incorrect Median Calculation**: The program calculates the median incorrectly. For even-length arrays, it should consider the average of the two middle elements, but the program only considers one middle element. For odd-length arrays, it correctly identifies the middle element.

3. **Inefficient Median Increment**: The program increments the median element until it is greater than the current median, which is inefficient and may not always produce the correct result. The correct approach would be to increment the smallest element that is less than the next higher element in the sorted array to increase the median.

4. **Breaking the Loop Early**: The program breaks the loop after the first test case if the array length is greater than 10000, which means it will not process all test cases correctly.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
2
3
1 2 3
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
1
```

For the second test case, the program fails to correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. The correct answer is 2, but the program outputs 1.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
