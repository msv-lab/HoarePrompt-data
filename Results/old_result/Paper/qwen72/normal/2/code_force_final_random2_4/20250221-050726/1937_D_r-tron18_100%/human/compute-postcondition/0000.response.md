The code snippet creates a list named `pre` which contains the indices (1-based) of all occurrences of the character '>' in the string `s1`. The original string `s1` and the integer `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.**
