The function `func` does not explicitly define parameters in its signature, but based on the given context, it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 50) and a list of `n` integers (each integer `a_i` where 0 <= a_i <= 99). The function is expected to handle `t` test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^3.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, and return the result for each test case.
