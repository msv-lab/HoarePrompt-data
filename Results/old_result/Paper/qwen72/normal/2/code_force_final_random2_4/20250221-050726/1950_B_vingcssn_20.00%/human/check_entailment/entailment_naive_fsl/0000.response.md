Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program is incorrect because it only handles specific values of `n` (1, 2, 3, 4) explicitly and prints hardcoded patterns for these values. For any other value of `n` (e.g., `n = 5`), the program will print "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern. This violates the problem description, which requires the program to handle any value of `n` within the range 1 to 20. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
