Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `ans` is True.** 

The variable `ans` is set to `True`, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `_`, `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
