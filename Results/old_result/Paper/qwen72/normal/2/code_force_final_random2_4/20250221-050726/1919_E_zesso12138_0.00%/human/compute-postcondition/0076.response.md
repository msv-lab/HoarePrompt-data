Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is still a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1, `offset` is still equal to `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1, and `j` is 2 * n. The elements of `new_dp` are updated based on the transitions from `dp` as follows: For each `j` in the range [0, 2 * n], if `dp[j] > 0`, then `new_dp[j + 1]` and `new_dp[j - 1]` (if within bounds) are incremented by `dp[j]` modulo MOD.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range `[0, 2 * n]`.
- For each `j` in this range, if `dp[j]` is greater than 0, the loop updates `new_dp[j + 1]` and `new_dp[j - 1]` (if they are within the valid index range) by adding `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`.
- After the loop completes, `j` will be `2 * n`, and `new_dp` will contain the updated values based on the transitions from `dp`.
- The variables `n`, `p`, `dp`, `offset`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
