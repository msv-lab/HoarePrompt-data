To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop head:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).
- `x` is 5.
- `y` is 1.
- `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\).
- `n` must be at least 25.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
1. \((x + y) * x \leq n\)
2. \((x + y) * y \leq m\)

### Substituting the Initial Values:
- \(x = 5\)
- \(y = 1\)

So, the conditions become:
1. \((5 + 1) * 5 \leq n\) which simplifies to \(30 \leq n\)
2. \((5 + 1) * 1 \leq m\) which simplifies to \(6 \leq m\)

### Analysis:
- The condition \(30 \leq n\) is more restrictive than \(n \geq 25\) (which is already given).
- The condition \(6 \leq m\) is less restrictive and should be satisfied since \(m\) is a positive integer and \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes the first time, `n` must be at least 30. Since `m` is already within the range \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), no adjustment is needed for `m`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), `x` is 5, `y` is 1, and `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\). Additionally, `n` must be at least 30.**
