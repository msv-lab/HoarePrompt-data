Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `n` is a new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b = ''` sets the variable `b` to an empty string. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `b` and retains the initial values of the other variables.
