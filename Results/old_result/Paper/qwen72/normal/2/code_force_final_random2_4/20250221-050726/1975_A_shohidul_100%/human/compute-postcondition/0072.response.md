Output State: **_ is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`, `i` is 3, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 3 to the end of the list, `check_all_new` remains unchanged, `new_all` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `new = a[i:]` assigns to `new` a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 3 (since `i` is 3) to the end of the list. The values of `check_all_new` and `new_all` remain unchanged as specified in the initial state. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
