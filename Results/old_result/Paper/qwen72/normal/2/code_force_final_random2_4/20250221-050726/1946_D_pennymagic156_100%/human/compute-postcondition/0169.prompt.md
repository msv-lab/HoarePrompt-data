Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(29, -1, -1):
    u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
    if u == v == 0:
        continue
    if u == 0:
        if v % 2:
            return ans
        else:
            op = ai = 0
            for val in a:
                op ^= val >> i & 1
                ai ^= val
                if not op:
                    t.append(ai)
                    ai = 0
            a, t = t, []
    elif v % 2:
        continue
    elif v:
        op = cnt = 0
        for val in a:
            op ^= val >> i & 1
            if not op:
                cnt += 1
        ans = max(ans, cnt)
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, and `i` is 29. If `u` (the bit at position 29 in `x`) is 0, `a` is a list containing the XOR of all elements in the original `a` that contributed to making `op` 0 at some point during the loop, `val` is the last element of the original `a`, `op` is the XOR of the bits at position 29 of all elements in the original `a`, and `ai` is the XOR of all elements in the original `a` if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` is 0. If `u` is 1, and `v` (the sum of the bits at position 29 in each element of `a`) is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop, and `ans` remains -1. If `v` is even, `ans` is updated to the maximum of the previous value of `ans` (-1) and `cnt`, where `cnt` is the number of elements in `a` whose 30th bit contributes to making `op` (the XOR of the 30th bits of all elements in `a`) equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`u` is the bit at position 28 in `x`, `v` is the sum of the bits at position 28 in each element of `a`, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, and `i` is 28. If `u` is 0, `a` is now an empty list, `t` is the list that previously contained `0` if `op` was 0 at any point during the loop, otherwise `t` is an empty list. `op` is the XOR of the 28th bits of all elements in the original `a`. `ai` is the XOR of all elements in the original `a`. `val` is the last element processed in the loop. If `u` is 1, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `i` is 28, and `ans` is -1. If `v` is odd, the state remains as described. If `v` is even and non-zero, `ans` is the count of elements in `a` whose 29th bit (from the right) is 0, `op` is the result of XORing the 29th bit (from the right) of all elements in `a`, and `cnt` is the count of elements in `a` whose 29th bit (from the right) is 0. If `v` is 0, `ans` is -1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `i` is 27, and `ans` is -1. If `u` is 0 and `v` is 0, `a` is now an empty list, `t` is the list that previously contained `0` if `op` was 0 at any point during the loop, otherwise `t` is an empty list. `op` is the XOR of the 28th bits of all elements in the original `a`, and `ai` is 0. If `u` is 0 and `v` is not 0, `a` is now a list containing the elements from `t` where the 28th bit (bit 27) is 0, and `val` is the last element processed in the loop. If `u` is 1 and `v` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\). If `u` is 1 and `v` is odd, `ans` remains -1, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `u` is 1 and `v` is even and non-zero, `ans` is the count of elements in `a` whose 29th bit (from the right) is 0, `op` is the result of XORing the 28th bit (from the right) of each element in `a`, and `cnt` is the count of times `op` was 0 during the loop iterations. If `u` is 1 and `v` is 0, `ans` is -1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
