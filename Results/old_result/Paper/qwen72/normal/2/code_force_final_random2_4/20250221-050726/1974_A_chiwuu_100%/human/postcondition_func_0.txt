The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. It then calculates a value `t` based on the following rules: if `b` is even, `t` is set to `b // 2`; if `b` is odd, `t` is set to `(b // 2) + 1`. It further adjusts `t` based on the difference between `a` and a calculated value `t1` (which is `t * 15 - b * 4`). If `t1` is less than `a`, `t` is incremented by the ceiling of the division of the difference `a - t1` by 15. Finally, the function prints the computed value of `t` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
