Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, representing the number of test cases. n is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    m = int(input())
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    ans = True
    for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
            if nums != sorted(nums):
                ans = False
                break
            arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
    print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, and `i` is 1. If any element `arr[j]` (where 1 <= j < m) was found to be less than `arr[j - 1]` during the loop, and the resulting list `nums` (containing the digits of `arr[j - 1]` followed by `arr[j]`) was not sorted, then `ans` is set to False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. The elements of `arr` may have been modified such that for each `j` where `arr[j] < arr[j - 1]` was true, `arr[j - 1]` is updated to the first digit of `nums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 1, and `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the condition inside the loop was met and the `nums` list remained sorted throughout all iterations. If at any point `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the loop terminates early. Otherwise, `ans` remains True after all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n-1 <= 50, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 0, and `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the subsequent checks were met during the loop execution. If any iteration found `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the resulting `nums` was not sorted, `ans` is set to False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. The elements of `arr` may have been modified based on the conditions within the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
