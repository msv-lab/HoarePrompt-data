### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - **Anna's Move:** Anna reverses the digits of a chosen number. This operation does not change the total number of digits across all numbers.
   - **Sasha's Move:** Sasha concatenates two numbers, reducing the total number of numbers by one but increasing the total number of digits.

2. **Winning Condition:**
   - Sasha wins if the final number has at least \(10^m\) digits.
   - Anna wins otherwise.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The total number of digits in the list initially is the sum of the lengths of the string representations of the numbers.
   - Each of Anna's moves does not change the total number of digits.
   - Each of Sasha's moves reduces the number of numbers by one but increases the total number of digits by the sum of the lengths of the two chosen numbers minus one (since the two numbers are replaced by one).

4. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1`**:
     - It calculates the initial total number of digits (`tot`).
     - It then sorts the list of trailing zero counts (`cntvals`) in descending order.
     - It subtracts every second element in `cntvals` from `tot`.
     - Finally, it checks if the resulting total is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\).

   - **`zerocnts`**:
     - It counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of a number.

5. **Logic Behind the Subtraction:**
   - The subtraction of every second element in `cntvals` is likely intended to account for the fact that trailing zeros do not contribute to the length of the number when concatenated. However, this logic is not entirely clear and might be a simplification or an approximation.

6. **Verification:**
   - The provided output hints suggest that the function `func_1` correctly handles the game mechanics and the winning condition.
   - The function `zerocnts` correctly counts trailing zeros, which is a necessary part of the overall logic.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem description and the provided execution summaries, the program appears to correctly implement the game mechanics and the winning condition. The logic of subtracting every second element in the sorted list of trailing zero counts is a bit unconventional but seems to work within the context of the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
