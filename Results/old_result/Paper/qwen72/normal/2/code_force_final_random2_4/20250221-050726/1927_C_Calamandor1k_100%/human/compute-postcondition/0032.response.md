Output State: **All initial state variables remain unchanged, but the program continues to the next line of code.** 

This means that `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range, `cases` is still a list of tuples with at least two tuples, `results` still contains the strings 'YES' and 'NO', `unique_a` and `unique_b` are sets of unique elements from lists `a` and `b` respectively, `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` are sets of elements from `unique_a` and `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` and `only_b` are sets of elements unique to `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` respectively, `both` is a set of elements common to both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, and `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. The `continue` statement does not alter any of these variables but moves the execution to the next iteration of the loop or the next line of code outside a loop.
