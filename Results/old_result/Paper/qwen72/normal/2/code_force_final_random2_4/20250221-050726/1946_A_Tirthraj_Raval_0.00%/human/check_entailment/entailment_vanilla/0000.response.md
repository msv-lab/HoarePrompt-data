### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
   - An operation consists of choosing an integer \( i \) (1 ≤ \( i \) ≤ \( n \)) and increasing \( a_i \) by 1.
   - The median of an array is the middle element when the array is sorted.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It sorts the array \( a \).
   - It calculates the index \( p \) of the median element using \( p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1 \).
   - It counts the number of occurrences of the median element in the array and prints this count.

3. **Identifying the Flaw:**
   - The solution counts the number of occurrences of the median element, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.
   - To increase the median, we need to focus on the elements around the median and determine how many operations are needed to make the median element larger than its current value.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - If the array has an odd length, the median is the middle element.
   - If the array has an even length, the median is the average of the two middle elements.
   - To increase the median, we need to increase the value of the median element or the elements around it.
   - The correct approach involves finding the next largest element greater than the current median and calculating the number of operations needed to make the median equal to this next largest element.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. It simply counts the occurrences of the median element, which is not relevant to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
