Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where each element `a` and `b` read from the input during the loop has been appended to `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` respectively, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `x` is 100000, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R` is 100000, `L` is 99998, and either `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`).**

Explanation:
- The value of `R` is updated to 100000, which is the same as the value of `x`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
