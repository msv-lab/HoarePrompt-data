Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, `b` is a list `[0, 0]`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `b` with two elements, both set to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `queries`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
