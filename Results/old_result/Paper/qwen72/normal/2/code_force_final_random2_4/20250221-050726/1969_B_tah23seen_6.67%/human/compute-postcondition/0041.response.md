To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to consider the conditions in the loop head: `left < len(s)` and `s[left] != '1'`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` contains all the characters of `sChar` in the same order.
- `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` or `len(s)` if no '1' is found.
- `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found.

For the loop to execute, `left` must be less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` must not be '1'. 

However, since `left` is defined as the index of the first '1' in `s` or `len(s)` if no '1' is found, the condition `s[left] != '1'` will never be true if `left` is set correctly. Therefore, to make the loop execute, we need to adjust the state of `left` so that it points to an index where `s[left]` is not '1'.

Since `s` is a binary string, it must contain at least one '0' (because it has a length of at least 2 and `left` is the index of the first '1'). We can set `left` to 0, which ensures that `left < len(s)` and `s[left]` is not '1' (assuming the first character is '0').

Thus, the modified state is:
State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` still contains all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `left` is 0, `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found.**
