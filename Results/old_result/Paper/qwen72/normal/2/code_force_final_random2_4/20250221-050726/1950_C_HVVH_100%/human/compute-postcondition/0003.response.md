The code snippet reads input from the user, expecting it to be in the format "hh:mm", and then splits this input into two parts, converting them to integers and assigning them to the variables `h` and `m` respectively.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an integer representing the hour part of the input time, `m` is an integer representing the minute part of the input time.**
