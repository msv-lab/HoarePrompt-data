### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to determine if the original assessment is accurate or not.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for k excursions.
- Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value \( f_i \).
- If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
- The expected value for each pair is the initial friendship value plus the expected increase in friendship value over k excursions.
- The expected increase in friendship value for each pair is \( \frac{k - 1}{\binom{n}{2}} \) because each pair has a probability of \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \) of being chosen in each excursion, and this happens k times.

#### Correct Formula:
The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions is:

\[ E = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( f_i + \frac{k - 1}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \]

Where:
- \( f_i \) is the initial friendship value of the i-th pair.
- \( \binom{n}{2} \) is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of n, which is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

#### Program Analysis:
The program calculates `p` and `q` as follows:

```python
p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)
q = 2 * cn2 ** 2
```

Let's break down these calculations:
- `cn2` is \( \binom{n}{2} \), which is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
- `sum_f` is the sum of all initial friendship values \( f_i \).

The formula used in the program is:

\[ p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \]
\[ q = 2 \cdot (\binom{n}{2})^2 \]

This formula does not match the correct expected value formula. The correct formula should be:

\[ E = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( f_i + \frac{k - 1}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \]

To convert this into a fraction, we get:

\[ E = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i + m \cdot \frac{k - 1}{\binom{n}{2}} \]

Multiplying through by \( \binom{n}{2} \):

\[ E \cdot \binom{n}{2} = \binom{n}{2} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i + m \cdot (k - 1) \]

So, the correct `p` and `q` should be:

\[ p = \binom{n}{2} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i + m \cdot (k - 1) \]
\[ q = \binom{n}{2} \]

#### Example Test Case:
Consider the test case:

```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```

- \( n = 3 \)
- \( m = 1 \)
- \( k = 2 \)
- \( f_1 = 1 \)

Using the correct formula:

\[ \binom{n}{2} = \frac{3 \cdot 2}{2} = 3 \]

\[ E = 1 + \frac{2 - 1}{3} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3} \]

Converting to a fraction:

\[ p = 3 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot (2 - 1) = 3 + 1 = 4 \]
\[ q = 3 \]

The program's formula gives:

\[ p = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 2 \cdot (2 - 1) = 12 + 2 = 14 \]
\[ q = 2 \cdot 3^2 = 18 \]

Clearly, the program's formula is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the calculation of the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The formula used in the program is incorrect, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.

Final: **False**
