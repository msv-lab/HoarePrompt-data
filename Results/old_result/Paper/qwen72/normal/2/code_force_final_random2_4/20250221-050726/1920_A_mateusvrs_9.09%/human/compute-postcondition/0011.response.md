The value of `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and the current value of `bx`. Since the current value of `bx` is -1, `bx` will be updated to the value of `x` if `x` is greater than -1. Otherwise, `bx` remains -1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `a` is 1, `x` is an input integer.**
