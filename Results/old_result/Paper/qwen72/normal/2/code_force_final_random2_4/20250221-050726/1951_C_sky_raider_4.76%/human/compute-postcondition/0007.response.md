The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is set to 0 before the loop starts, which is correct for the loop to begin.

Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `s` is 0, `c` is `k * k / 2`**
