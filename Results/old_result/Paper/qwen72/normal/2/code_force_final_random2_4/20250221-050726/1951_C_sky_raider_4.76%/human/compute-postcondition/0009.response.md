The value of `k` is decreased by `s`, which is the minimum of `m` and `k`. Since `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `k` will be reduced by the smaller of these two values. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer reduced by the minimum of `m` and `k`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `k * k / 2` before the reduction of `k`.**
