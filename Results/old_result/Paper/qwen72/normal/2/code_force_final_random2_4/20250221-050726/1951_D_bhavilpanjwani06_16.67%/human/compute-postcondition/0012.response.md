Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
- `k` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k` (\(n \geq k\)).
- `n` is not equal to `k` (\(n \neq k\)).
- The condition \((k - 1 < n - k + 1)\) holds true.

### Analysis:
- The condition \((k - 1 < n - k + 1)\) simplifies to:
  \[
  k - 1 < n - k + 1
  \]
  Adding \(k - 1\) to both sides:
  \[
  2k - 2 < n
  \]
  Adding 2 to both sides:
  \[
  2k < n + 2
  \]
  Since \(n \geq k\) and \(n \neq k\), this condition is always true for valid inputs.

### Print Statement:
```
print(n - k + 1, 1)
```

### Explanation:
- The expression `n - k + 1` is evaluated first.
- Given the condition \(2k < n + 2\), it follows that \(n - k + 1\) is a positive integer.
- The second argument in the `print` statement is the integer `1`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of `n - k + 1` followed by the integer `1`.

Output: **n - k + 1, 1 (where n - k + 1 is the result of the expression n - k + 1)**
