The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call forces the output buffer to flush, ensuring that any buffered data is written to the terminal or output stream immediately. However, this operation does not change the values of any variables or alter the program's state beyond ensuring that any pending output is displayed.

Given the initial state:
- `kp` is 2
- `n` is the input integer
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`

The `sys.stdout.flush()` call does not modify any of these variables.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` is `n-1`, and `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`.**
