t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. n is a positive integer representing the number of signs, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. path is a string containing n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs.
