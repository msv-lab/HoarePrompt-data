Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `p` is an empty list, `c` is now `c + x`, `x` is the first element in `l`.**

Explanation: The value of `c` is updated by adding the value of `x` to it. The value of `x` is the first element in the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
