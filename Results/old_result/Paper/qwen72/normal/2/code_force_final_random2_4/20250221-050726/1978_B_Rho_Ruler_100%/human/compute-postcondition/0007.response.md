Postcondition: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`; `mid` is (0 + min(n, b)) // 2; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b); `max_profit` is the maximum of the original `max_profit` (which was 0) and `profit_mid`. Additionally, the current value of `profit_next` is greater than the current value of `profit_mid`.**
