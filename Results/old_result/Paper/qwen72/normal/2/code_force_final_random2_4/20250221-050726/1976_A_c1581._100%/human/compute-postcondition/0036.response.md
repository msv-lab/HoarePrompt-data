Output State: **`password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits from `password` in the order they appeared before sorting, `letters` is a sorted list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appeared before sorting, and `i` is `len(digits) - 1`. The loop has completed all iterations without returning False, meaning no digit in `digits` is greater than the next digit, and no digit in `digits` is greater than any letter in `letters` up to the last index of `digits`.**
