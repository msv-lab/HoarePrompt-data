Functionality: ** The function `func_4` takes two lists of integers, `bigList` and `smallList`, where `bigList` is at least as long as `smallList` and both contain at least one element. It removes matching elements from the end of both lists until either the lists no longer have matching elements at the end or one of the lists becomes empty. The function then returns the last element of `bigList`, which is an integer and does not match the last element of `smallList` (if any remains). If `bigList` becomes empty, the function will raise an IndexError. **
