To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `right < len(s)`**
   - This condition ensures that `right` is within the bounds of the list `s`.
   - If `right` is already equal to or greater than `len(s)`, the loop will not execute.

2. **Condition 2: `s[right] != '0'`**
   - This condition checks that the character at index `right` in the list `s` is not '0'.
   - If `s[right]` is '0', the loop will not execute.

### Current State:
- `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order.
- `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` or `len(s)` if no '1' is found.
- `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found, plus 2.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true:
  - `right` must be less than `len(s)`.
  - The character at index `right` in `s` must not be '0'.

Given the current state:
- `right` is the index of the first '0' in `s` starting from index 1, or `len(s)` if no '0' is found, plus 2.
- If `right` is `len(s) + 2`, it is already out of bounds, and the loop will not execute.
- If `right` is less than `len(s)`, then `s[right]` must not be '0' for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
- To ensure the loop executes one more time, `right` must be less than `len(s)` and `s[right]` must not be '0'.
- Since `right` is defined as the index of the first '0' starting from index 1, plus 2, we need to ensure that `right` is still within bounds and points to a non-'0' character.

### Final State:
State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` or `len(s)` if no '1' is found, `right` is less than `len(s)` and `s[right]` is not '0'**
