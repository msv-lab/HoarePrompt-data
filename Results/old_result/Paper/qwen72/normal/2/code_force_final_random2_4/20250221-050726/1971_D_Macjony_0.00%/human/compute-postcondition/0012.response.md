Postcondition: ***`s` is a new input binary string with a length of 2 to 500 characters, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 2, `j` is 0, and the first character of `s` (`s[j]`) is different from the second character of `s` (`s[j + 1]`). If `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `flag` is True and `j` is 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains False and `j` remains 0.***
