Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `n` is a new input integer, `arr` is a new input string, and `results` is a list. If the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is greater than the number of 'D' characters, `results` contains one additional 'yes' at the end. Otherwise, `results` contains: ['no', 'no', 'no'] if `n` is even, ['yes', 'no', 'no'] if `n` is odd and the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is greater than the number of 'D' characters, or ['no', 'no', 'no'] if `n` is odd and the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is not greater than the number of 'D' characters.***
