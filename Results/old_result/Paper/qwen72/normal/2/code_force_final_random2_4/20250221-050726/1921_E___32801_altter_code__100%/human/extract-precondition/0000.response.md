Precondition: **The function `func_1` is not correctly defined for the problem. The correct function definition should include parameters for the board dimensions and the initial positions of the chips, such as `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an additional parameter `t` for the number of test cases.** 

However, based on the problem description, the correct function definition should look something like this:

```python
def game_outcome(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing the values `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`.

Given this, the precondition would be:

**t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case is a tuple (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) where h and w are the dimensions of the board (1 ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^9), and (x_a, y_a) and (x_b, y_b) are the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w), with the guarantee that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. The sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**
