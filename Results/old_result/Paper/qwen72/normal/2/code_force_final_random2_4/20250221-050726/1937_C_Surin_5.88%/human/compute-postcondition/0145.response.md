The `sys.stdout.flush()` function flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that all data written to the standard output is immediately sent to the terminal or console. This operation does not change any of the variables in the current state.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` is 3, and `prev` is 0 (or 2 if `r` is '>').**
