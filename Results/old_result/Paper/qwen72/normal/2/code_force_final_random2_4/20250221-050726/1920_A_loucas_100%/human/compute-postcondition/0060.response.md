The code `big.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the list `big`. Given that `a` is the last integer from the input and its value is 1, the list `big` will now contain the value 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has constraints (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `loop` must be greater than 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is the last integer from the input and its value is 1, `a` is the last integer from the input, `big` is [1], `less` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0.**
