The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `k`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, now `t` is `t - 1`.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5.
- `k` is an input integer where 0 < `k` ≤ `n`.
- `i` is 1.
- `c` and `r` are updated to the integers read from the input. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 4.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `k` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, now `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5; `k` is an input integer where 0 < `k` ≤ `n`; `i` is 2; `c` and `r` are updated to the integers read from the input. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 4.**
