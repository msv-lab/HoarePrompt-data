The code snippet `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `x` is an integer where x >= 1
- `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x
- `i` is 3
- `ans` is 1

The value of `ans` is initially 1, and the value of `i` is 3. The `max` function will compare these two values and assign the larger one to `ans`. Since 3 is greater than 1, `ans` will be updated to 3.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer where x >= 1, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 3, `ans` is 3.**
