The code snippet `x, a = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `a`. The values of `x` and `a` are updated based on the input provided.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
- Each test case has constraints (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9
- `loop` must be greater than 0
- `iterable` is 0
- `num` is 0
- `innerLoop` must be greater than 0
- `iterable2` is 1
- `x` is an input integer
- `a` is an input integer where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9
- If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`, `less` and `no` are empty lists
- If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, `big` and `no` are empty lists
- If `x` is not 1 or 2, `less` and `big` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing the value of `a`

After executing the code snippet:
- `x` is updated to the first integer from the input
- `a` is updated to the second integer from the input

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has constraints (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, if `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`, `less` and `no` are empty lists, if `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, `big` and `no` are empty lists, if `x` is not 1 or 2, `less` and `big` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.**
