Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \).
- `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `i` is `n // k`.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l < n + 1`.
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.
- The loop will have printed `! {i * v}` where `i` is the last value of `i` before the loop terminates.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('! -1', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range.
   - `v` is determined based on the condition that it equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
   - `i` is calculated as `n // k`.
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0.
   - `l` is the result of `func_2() + 1` and is guaranteed to be less than `n + 1`.
   - The loop condition ensures that either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

2. **Loop Behavior:**
   - The loop prints `! {i * v}` where `i` is the last value of `i` before the loop terminates.
   - This implies that the loop has already run and printed a specific value based on the conditions.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print('! -1', flush=True)` is outside the loop and will execute after the loop has completed.
   - The `flush=True` parameter ensures that the output is immediately written to the console.

### Conclusion:
The print statement `print('! -1', flush=True)` will simply print the string `! -1` to the console. The values of the variables and objects do not affect this particular print statement because it is a static string.

Output: **! -1**
