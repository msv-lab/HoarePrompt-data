The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `numero_testes` from the user input, which must be a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. The function then calls `func_1` exactly `numero_testes` times. After the function concludes, `numero_testes` remains unchanged, and `func_1` has been executed the specified number of times. The primary purpose of `func_2` is to repeatedly execute `func_1` a user-specified number of times.
