The code `b = l[y]` assigns the value of the element at index `y` in the list `l` to the variable `b`. Given that `y` is 2, `b` will be assigned the value of the third element in the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is 2, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is the third element in `l`, `c` is 0.**
