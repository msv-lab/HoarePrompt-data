The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, let's determine the output state:

- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` remains 2.
- `n` is the new user-provided integer.
- `k` is the new user-provided integer and must be non-negative.
- `x` is the new user-provided integer.
- `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input.
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `i` is `k`.
- `ans` initially contains one element and now contains one additional element, which is the value of `sums`.
- `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.

Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is a list containing two elements: the original element and the value of `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the new user-provided integer, `k` is the new user-provided integer and must be non-negative, `x` is the new user-provided integer, `a` is the reversed list of integers provided by the user input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is `k`, `ans` is a list containing two elements (the original element and `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`), and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
