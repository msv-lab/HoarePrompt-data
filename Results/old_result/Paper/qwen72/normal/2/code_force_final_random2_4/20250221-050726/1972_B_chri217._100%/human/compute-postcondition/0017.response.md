Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads input from the standard input. It first reads an integer `t` (where 1 <= t <= 100), indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only the characters 'U' and 'D'. The function returns a list named `cases` containing `t` tuples, where each tuple is of the form `(n, s)`. The string `s` is stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. **
