Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; `i` is 1; `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive).** 

The value of `x` is now a random integer between 1 and 9, while the other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
