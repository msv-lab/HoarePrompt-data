Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where each `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` contain the respective appended values from the loop, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input, `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` before the loop terminates, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L <= 1`. The final values of `L` and `R` will be such that `R - L <= 1`, and they will have been adjusted based on the conditions evaluated in each iteration of the loop.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `R - L > 1`.
- In each iteration, `x` is calculated as the midpoint between `L` and `R`.
- The `dfs(1, 1)` function is called, and its result is stored in `leftover`.
- Based on the conditions involving `numCuts` and `leftover`, either `L` is updated to `x` or `R` is updated to `x`.
- The loop will terminate when `R - L` is no longer greater than 1, meaning `R - L <= 1`.
- At the end of the loop, `L` and `R` will be very close to each other, and the final values of `L` and `R` will reflect the last adjustments made based on the conditions in the loop.
- All other variables (`t`, `z`, `n`, `adj`, `i`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
