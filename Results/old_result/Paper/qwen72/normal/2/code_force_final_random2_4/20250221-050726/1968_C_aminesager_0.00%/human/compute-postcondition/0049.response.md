Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is `0`, `n` is the last input integer, `a` is a list of `n` elements where each element is calculated as described, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, and `line` and `T` are the last input string and its corresponding list of integers, respectively.**

Explanation:
- `t` is decremented by 1 with each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `t` will be `0`.
- `n` is updated with each new test case input, so it will hold the value of the last test case's `n`.
- `a` is a list that starts with `[1000]` and is updated in each iteration to contain `n` elements, where each element is derived from the previous element minus the corresponding value in `T`. After the loop, `a` will be reversed and contain the final calculated values.
- `result` is a string that contains the elements of `a` separated by spaces, which is printed for each test case.
- `line` and `T` will hold the values of the last input string and its corresponding list of integers, respectively, from the last test case.
