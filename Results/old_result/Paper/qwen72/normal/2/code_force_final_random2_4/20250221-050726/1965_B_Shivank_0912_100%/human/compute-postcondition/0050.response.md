The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `tc` relative to `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 2, and `tc` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 2, `i` is the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \), `j` is 19, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least \( 2^i \). The list `ans` contains the initial elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` followed by the powers of 2 from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19`, excluding `1 << i`.**
