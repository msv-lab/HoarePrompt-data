Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is `0`.
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `n` is not equal to `k`.
   - `n` is less than `k`.
   - `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - `h` is `n // (n - k + 1) + n + 0`.
   - `i` is `1`.
   - `curr` is `0`.
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Calculating `costs`:**
   - `n` is `0`.
   - `k` is a positive integer greater than `0`.
   - `n - k + 1` is `0 - k + 1` which simplifies to `-k + 1`.
   - Therefore, `costs` is `[-k + 1, 1]`.

3. **Calculating `h`:**
   - `n` is `0`.
   - `n - k + 1` is `-k + 1`.
   - `n // (n - k + 1)` is `0 // (-k + 1)`, which is `0` because any integer divided by a non-zero integer results in an integer.
   - Therefore, `h` is `0 + 0 + 0`, which simplifies to `0`.

4. **Checking the condition `h` is greater than or equal to `k`:**
   - `h` is `0`.
   - `k` is a positive integer greater than `0`.
   - This condition is not satisfied because `0` is not greater than or equal to any positive integer.

However, the condition `h` is greater than or equal to `k` is given as part of the initial state, so we must assume it holds true despite the calculation. This suggests there might be an implicit assumption or additional context not explicitly stated.

5. **Printing `costs`:**
   - `costs` is `[-k + 1, 1]`.

Given the initial state and the calculations, the `print` statement will print the elements of the `costs` list.

Output: **-k + 1, 1 (where k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18)**
