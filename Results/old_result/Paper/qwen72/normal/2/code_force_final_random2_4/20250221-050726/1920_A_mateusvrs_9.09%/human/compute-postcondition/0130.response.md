Output State: **_ is n-1, `n` is the input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` values where `a` was 2, and `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` values where `a` was 1. If no `a` was 1, `bx` remains -1. If no `a` was 2, `ax` remains 1000000007.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop:
- The loop counter `_` has reached `n-1`.
- The variable `n` retains its original value as the number of iterations.
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variables `a` and `x` are still integers provided by user input.
- The set `cx` contains all unique `x` values for which `a` was neither 1 nor 2.
- The variable `ax` holds the minimum value of all `x` values where `a` was 2. If there were no such `x` values, `ax` remains 1000000007.
- The variable `bx` holds the maximum value of all `x` values where `a` was 1. If there were no such `x` values, `bx` remains -1.
