Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has constraints (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing two instances of `a`, `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `big` is a list containing one instance of `a`, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `less` and `big` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing the value of `a`. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the value of `a` twice, `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not 2, `big` and `less` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.*** 

To simplify:
- If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing two instances of `a`, `less` and `no` are empty lists.
- If `x` is 2, `big` is a list containing one instance of `a`, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `no` is an empty list.
- If `x` is not 1 or 2, `less` and `big` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.
