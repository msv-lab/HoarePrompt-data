### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's re-evaluate the problem and the program step by step, using the annotated version to validate the original assessment.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Rules:**
   - Players take turns, starting with Alice.
   - Each turn consists of two steps:
     1. Choose to swap wallets or keep the current one.
     2. Remove 1 coin from the current wallet (if possible).
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Optimal Play:**
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move to avoid losing.
   - The key to winning is to force the opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move.

3. **Winning Condition:**
   - If the number of coins in both wallets is the same (i.e., \(a = b\)), the player whose turn it is will lose because they cannot make a valid move without making the other player win in the next turn.
   - If the number of coins in the wallets is different, the player with more coins can always force the game into a state where the other player loses.

4. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The game can be reduced to a parity problem. If the difference between the number of coins in the wallets is even, Bob will win because he can always mirror Alice's moves.
   - If the difference is odd, Alice will win because she can always force Bob into a losing position.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins \(a\) and \(b\) in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
- It checks if the absolute difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is even or odd.
- If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
- If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

#### Verification Using Annotations:
- **Initial State:** \(t\) is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). For each of the \(t\) test cases, \(a\) and \(b\) are integers where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).
- **Loop Iteration:** For each test case, the program reads \(a\) and \(b\).
- **Condition Check:** The program checks if \(|a - b|\) is even or odd.
  - If \(|a - b|\) is even, it prints "Bob".
  - If \(|a - b|\) is odd, it prints "Alice".
- **Final State:** After processing all test cases, the program terminates.

#### Evaluation:
- The program correctly implements the logic derived from the problem's mathematical insight.
- The condition \(|a - b| \% 2 == 0\) correctly identifies when Bob will win, and \(|a - b| \% 2 != 0\) correctly identifies when Alice will win.
- The program handles the input and output format as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs as described in the problem.

Final: **True**
