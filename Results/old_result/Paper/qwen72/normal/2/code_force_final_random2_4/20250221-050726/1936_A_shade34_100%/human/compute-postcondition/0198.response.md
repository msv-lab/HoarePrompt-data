Output State: **_ is 1, n is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), i is n-1, mak is the highest value of i for which the user input was `<`, mak2 is the highest value of i for which the user input was `<`, and pans is a list containing all values of i for which the user input was `=` or the last value of i for which the user input was `<`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `_` remains 1 as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains the same as it is the input and not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes because the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`.
- The variable `mak` will be the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- The variable `mak2` will be the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<` (as per the given code, `mak2` is not updated, so it remains the same).
- The variable `pans` will contain all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`. This is because each time the user input is `=`, `i` is appended to `pans`, and if the user input is `<`, `pans` is reset to `[i]`.
