Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. If `s` has more than one character and all characters are the same, then `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s2` is a shuffled version of `s` with the same length and characters. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is the string `s` rotated one position to the left.***
