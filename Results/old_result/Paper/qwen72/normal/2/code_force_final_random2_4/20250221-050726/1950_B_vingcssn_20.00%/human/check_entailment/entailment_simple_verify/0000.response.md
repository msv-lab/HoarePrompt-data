Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program provided does indeed only handle specific values of `n` (1, 2, 3, 4) and prints hardcoded patterns for these values. For any other value of `n` outside this range, it prints "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern. According to the problem description, the program should handle any value of `n` within the range 1 to 20 and generate the appropriate checkerboard pattern. Since the program fails to do this for values of `n` greater than 4, it is incorrect.

Final: **False**
