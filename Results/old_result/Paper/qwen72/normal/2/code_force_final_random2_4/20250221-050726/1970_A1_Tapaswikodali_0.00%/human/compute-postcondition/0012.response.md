The value of `balance` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `balance` is either 1 or -1 depending on whether `char` is '(' or ')'. Therefore, if `char` is '(', `balance` was 1 and is now 0. If `char` is ')', `balance` was -1 and is now -2. The values of `s`, `i`, `char`, and `details` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it should be a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000, `i` is 1, `char` is the second character in `s`, if `char` is '(', `balance` is 0. If `char` is ')', `balance` is -2. `details` is a list containing the tuple `(balance, 0, char)` from the previous iteration.**
