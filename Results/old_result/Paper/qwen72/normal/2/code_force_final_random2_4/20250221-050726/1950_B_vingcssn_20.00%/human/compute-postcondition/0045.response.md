Based on the initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

- `c` is 1.
- `casos` is greater than 1.
- `n` is an input integer with specific conditions:
  - If `n` is 1, the current value of `n` is 1.
  - If `n` is 2, the current value of `n` is 2.
  - If `n` is 3, the current value of `n` is 3.
  - If `n` is 4, the current value of `n` remains 4.
  - Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('##..##')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'##..##'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **##..##**
