To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: A non-zero integer decreased by 1.
2. **`n`**: An integer where \(4 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
3. **`a`**: A list of \(n\) integers where \(0 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq 10^9\).
4. **`m`**: An integer where \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\).
5. **`queries`**: A list of \(m\) pairs \((x_i, y_i)\) where \(1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq n\) and \(x_i \neq y_i\).
6. **`b`**: A list with the last two elements being the cumulative sums of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy certain conditions.
7. **`u`**: The value returned by `r()` minus 1 and is assumed to be truthy.
8. **`c` and `d`**: The values returned by `r()`, and `c` is less than `d`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `b`**:
   - `b` is a list where the last two elements are cumulative sums of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy certain conditions.
   - Let's denote these cumulative sums as `cumulative_sum_d` and `cumulative_sum_c` for the indices related to `d` and `c` respectively.

2. **Indices Calculation**:
   - The expression `(d - 1) * 2` calculates the index in `b` for the cumulative sum related to `d`.
   - Similarly, `(c - 1) * 2` calculates the index in `b` for the cumulative sum related to `c`.

3. **Subtraction**:
   - The `print` statement subtracts the cumulative sum at index `(c - 1) * 2` from the cumulative sum at index `(d - 1) * 2`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the difference between the cumulative sums of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy certain conditions, specifically the difference between the cumulative sum at index `(d - 1) * 2` and the cumulative sum at index `(c - 1) * 2`.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where b[(d - 1) * 2] and b[(c - 1) * 2] are the cumulative sums of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy certain conditions)**
