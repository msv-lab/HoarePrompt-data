The only object in the loop head is the variable `n`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0 after being decremented.

State: **`n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and its previous value. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the initial value of `ax`. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `x` has been added to the collection `cx`.**
