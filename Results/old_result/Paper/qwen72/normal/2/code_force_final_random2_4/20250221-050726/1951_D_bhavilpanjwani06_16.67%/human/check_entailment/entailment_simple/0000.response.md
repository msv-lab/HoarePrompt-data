Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels with \( n \) coins. Let's break down the logic step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Reading Test Case Input**: Inside `func_1()`, the program reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input.

3. **Initial Check**: The program checks if \( n \) is less than \( k \). If so, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy \( k \) jewels with fewer than \( k \) coins.

4. **Exact Match**: If \( n \) equals \( k \), the program prints "YES" followed by 1 and \( n \). This is correct because Alice can buy exactly \( k \) jewels from a single stall priced at \( n \) coins each.

5. **Greedy Strategy**: If \( n \) is greater than \( k \), the program checks if \( k - 1 \) is less than \( n - k + 1 \). If this condition holds, it prints "YES" followed by 2 and the prices \( n - k + 1 \) and 1. This strategy ensures that Alice buys \( k - 1 \) jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling \( k \) jewels.

6. **Final Check**: If none of the above conditions hold, the program prints "NO".

Let's verify the correctness of the logic:

- **Case 1**: \( n < k \)
  - Alice cannot buy \( k \) jewels with fewer than \( k \) coins.
  - Output: "NO"
  - Correct.

- **Case 2**: \( n = k \)
  - Alice can buy exactly \( k \) jewels from a single stall priced at \( n \) coins each.
  - Output: "YES\n1\nn"
  - Correct.

- **Case 3**: \( n > k \) and \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \)
  - Alice can buy \( k - 1 \) jewels from the first stall priced at \( n - k + 1 \) coins each and 1 jewel from the second stall priced at 1 coin.
  - Output: "YES\n2\nn - k + 1 1"
  - Correct.

- **Case 4**: \( n > k \) and \( k - 1 \geq n - k + 1 \)
  - It is impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.
  - Output: "NO"
  - Correct.

The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
