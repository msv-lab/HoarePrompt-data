Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` and `k` are integers input by the user with `k` being greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 5, `c` and `r` are the new integers input by the user, `num` is the total number of times `c` and `r` were compared, which is either `k` if `c == r` for all comparisons, or `2 * k` if `c != r` for all comparisons, `m` is `n - num` and must be greater than or equal to 4, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[4]` is updated to `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and `dp[5]` is updated to `(dp[4] + 4 * dp[3] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, `r`, `num`, `m`, and the list `dp`.
- The code updates `dp[i]` where `i` is 5.
- The formula used is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- Substituting `i = 5`, we get `dp[5] = (dp[4] + 4 * dp[3] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
