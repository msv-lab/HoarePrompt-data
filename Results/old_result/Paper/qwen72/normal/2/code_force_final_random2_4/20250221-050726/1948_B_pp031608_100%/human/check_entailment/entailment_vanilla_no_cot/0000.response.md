Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle the transformation of elements into their constituent digits and check if the array can be made non-decreasing. Specifically, the logic for checking and transforming the array is flawed:

1. **Incorrect Transformation Handling**: The program attempts to transform only one element at a time and checks if the resulting sub-array is sorted. However, it should consider the possibility of transforming multiple elements and ensuring the entire array can be made non-decreasing.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Sorted Order**: The program checks if the digits of a single element and the next element form a sorted list, but it does not correctly handle the transformation of the entire array. It should ensure that after all possible transformations, the entire array is non-decreasing.

3. **Early Termination**: The program terminates early if it finds a single pair of elements that cannot be transformed to maintain the sorted order, which might not be accurate for the entire array.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Consider all possible transformations of elements greater than or equal to 10.
- Ensure that after all transformations, the entire array is non-decreasing.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    def split_number(num):
        return [int(digit) for digit in str(num)]
    
    stack = []
    for num in arr:
        if num >= 10:
            digits = split_number(num)
            while digits:
                stack.append(digits.pop(0))
        else:
            stack.append(num)
        
        # Check if the stack is still sorted
        if len(stack) > 1 and stack[-1] < stack[-2]:
            return False
    return True

def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if can_be_sorted(arr):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the array can be transformed and checked for being non-decreasing correctly.
