Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value returned by `r()`, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. Additionally, in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely, and the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    r()
    a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
    b = [0, 0]
    for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
        v = y - x
        b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
    print(b, 'B')
    u, = r()
    while u:
        u -= 1
        c, d = r()
        if c < d:
            print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
        else:
            print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, `b` is a list with the last two elements being the cumulative sums of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy certain conditions, `u` is 0, `c` and `d` are the final values returned by `r()`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: After all iterations, `a` has its original length, `b` has been extended by 2 * (len(a) - 3) elements, where each pair of new elements in `b` is calculated as follows: the first new element is `b[-2] + v` if `v > x - w`, otherwise `b[-2] + 1`, and the second new element is `b[-1] + v` if `v > z - y`, otherwise `b[-1] + 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `queries`, and `u` remain unchanged. `u` is now `0` (falsy value). `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by the function `r()` during the last iteration. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` remains a list with at least 4 elements, `c` and `d` are the new values returned by the function `r()`, `b` is updated to `[0, 0, v1, v1 if v1 > x1 - w1 else 1, 2*v1 if v1 > z1 - y1 else v1 + 1, v2 if v2 > x2 - w2 else 1, v2 + (v2 if v2 > z2 - y2 else 1), ..., vn if vn > xn - wn else 1, vn + (vn if vn > zn - yn else 1)]`, `u` is the first value returned by the function `r()` minus the total number of iterations, and if `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
