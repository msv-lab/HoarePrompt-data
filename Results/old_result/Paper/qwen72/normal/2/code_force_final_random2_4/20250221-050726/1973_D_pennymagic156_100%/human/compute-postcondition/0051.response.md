Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 2, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1, so `cnt` becomes `k - 2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `v`, `i`, `l`) remain unchanged.
- The condition "either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`" remains valid because `cnt` is now `k - 2`, which is still not 0 (since `k` is at least 1).
