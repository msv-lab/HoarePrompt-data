Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) with an additional element `k - nums[idx]` appended, `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k` or `len(nums)` if no such element exists, `idx` is `i - 1` if `i` is less than `len(nums)`, otherwise `idx` remains -1.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`.
- The list `nums` initially contains powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).
- The variable `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or `len(nums)` if no such element exists.
- The variable `idx` is `i - 1` if `i` is less than `len(nums)`, otherwise `idx` remains -1.
- After appending `k - nums[idx]` to `nums`, the length of `nums` increases by 1, but the values of `i` and `idx` remain unchanged unless they are recalculated in subsequent code.
