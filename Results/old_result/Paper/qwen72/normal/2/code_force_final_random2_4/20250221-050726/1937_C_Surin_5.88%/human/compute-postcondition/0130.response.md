To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `kp` is 2
- `n` is the input integer
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `prev` is 0

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive).
- For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.
- The variable `i` is initialized to 1 at the start of the loop.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1.
- The variable `i` should be set to 1 at the start of the loop, but this is already handled by the `range(1, n)` function.
- The other variables (`kp`, `g`, `v1`, `prev`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
- `kp` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`
- `i` is 1 (this is set by the loop)
- `prev` is 0

### State:
**`kp` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` is 1, `prev` is 0**
