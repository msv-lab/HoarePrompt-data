### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges on a grid of size `n x m`.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to install supports for a single row.
   - It iterates through the row and updates the cost for each cell based on the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells plus the current cell's depth plus one.
   - The final cost for the row is the value in the last cell after processing.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and the grid of depths.
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows by summing the costs of these rows and selecting the minimum sum.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Input Handling:** The input is read correctly, and the grid is parsed into a list of lists.
   - **Cost Calculation:** The cost calculation in `func_1` is correct. It ensures that the cost for each cell is the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells plus the current cell's depth plus one.
   - **Consecutive Rows:** The function correctly calculates the total cost for `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The input handling, cost calculation, and finding the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows are all handled correctly.

Correctness: **True**
