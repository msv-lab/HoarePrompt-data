The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the parameters `m` and `n`. The loop iterates backward from `m - 1` down to `1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m - 1`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 to `m - 2`.

Given the current state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 50
- `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2
- `_` is a placeholder
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input
- `i` is `m - 1`
- `ans` is True

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be `m - 2`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is True**
