Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input, `ap` must be greater than 0, and `k` is 0. If `x` > 0 and `y` == 0, then the condition holds as specified. Otherwise, either `x` is less than or equal to 0, or `y` is not equal to 0, and it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.***
