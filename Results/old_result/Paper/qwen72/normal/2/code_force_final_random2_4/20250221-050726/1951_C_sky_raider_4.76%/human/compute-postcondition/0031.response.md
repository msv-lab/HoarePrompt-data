The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer minus the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `l` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `c` is now equal to `k * k / 2 + l[0] * s - s * s / 2`**
