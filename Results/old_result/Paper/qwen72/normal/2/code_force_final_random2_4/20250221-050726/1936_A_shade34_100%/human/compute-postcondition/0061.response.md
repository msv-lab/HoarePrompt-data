Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is the input positive integer.
- `i` is `n`.
- `mak` is `n-1` if the user input is `>`, otherwise `mak` remains 0.
- `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 3 elements.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
1. **`pans` List**:
   - `pans` contains values of `i` where the user input was `=` or `<`.
   - Since `pans` must have at least 3 elements, we know it has at least 3 values.

2. **`mak` Variable**:
   - If the user input was `>`, `mak` is `n-1`.
   - Otherwise, `mak` is 0.

3. **`i` Variable**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement will output a string starting with `'?'`.
   - It will then print four elements from the `pans` list:
     - `pans[mak]` twice.
     - `pans[i]` twice.

### Determining the Values:
- **`pans[mak]`**:
  - If the user input was `>`, `mak` is `n-1`.
  - If the user input was not `>`, `mak` is 0.
  - Therefore, `pans[mak]` will be either `pans[n-1]` or `pans[0]`.

- **`pans[i]`**:
  - Since `i` is `n`, `pans[i]` will be `pans[n]`.
  - However, since `pans` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` is `n`, `pans[n]` might not be valid if `n` is greater than the length of `pans`. For this analysis, we assume `n` is within the bounds of `pans`.

### Final Output:
- If the user input was `>`:
  - `mak` is `n-1`.
  - The print statement will output: `? pans[n-1] pans[n-1] pans[n] pans[n]`.

- If the user input was not `>`:
  - `mak` is 0.
  - The print statement will output: `? pans[0] pans[0] pans[n] pans[n]`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be one of the following:

- If the user input was `>`:
  - Output: **? pans[n-1] pans[n-1] pans[n] pans[n]**

- If the user input was not `>`:
  - Output: **? pans[0] pans[0] pans[n] pans[n]**

Since the exact values of `pans` are not provided, we use the indices to describe the output. The final output is:

Output: **? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[i] pans[i] (where mak is n-1 if the user input was >, otherwise 0, and i is n)**
