Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not follow the problem statement's requirements for calculating the minimum possible penalty. Instead, it calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters and returns this value. This approach fails to account for the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty, as required by the problem statement.

To illustrate, let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
```
6
+-+-+-
```
The correct output should indeed be `0` because the array can be split into `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])`, and the penalty for each subarray is `0`. However, the provided program will output `6` because it calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is `|3 - 3| = 0`, and then multiplies it by the length of the string, resulting in `6`.

This clearly shows that the program does not handle the problem as specified and thus is incorrect.

Final: **False**
