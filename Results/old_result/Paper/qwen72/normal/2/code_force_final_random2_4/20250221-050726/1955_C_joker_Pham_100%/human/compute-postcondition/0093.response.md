Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, and `r` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` depending on the condition. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r] < a[l]`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, `r` is updated to either `n - 2`, `n - 3`, or `n - 4` depending on the condition, and `sunks` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` is 0, otherwise `sunks` remains unchanged. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is updated to either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r]` is not less than `a[l]`, the program continues without changing `r` or `sunks`.***
