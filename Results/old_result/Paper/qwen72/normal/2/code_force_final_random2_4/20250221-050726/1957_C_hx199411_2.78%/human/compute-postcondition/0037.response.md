To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, now `t` is `t - 1`.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5.
- `k` is an input integer where 0 < `k` ≤ `n`.
- `i` is 4.
- `c` and `r` are the last pair of integers read from the input.
- `num` is the sum of 1 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are equal, and 2 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are not equal, over all `k` iterations.
- `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 4.
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, and `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(3, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variables `i` and `m`.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m`.

### Current State:
- `i` is 4.
- `m` must be at least 4.

### Adjustments:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- `m` must remain at least 4 for the loop to continue.

### Updated State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is 5.
- `m` must still be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, now `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5; `k` is an input integer where 0 < `k` ≤ `n`; `i` is 5; `c` and `r` are the last pair of integers read from the input; `num` is the sum of 1 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are equal, and 2 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are not equal, over all `k` iterations; `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 4; `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, and `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25.**
