Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `n` is a new input integer, `arr` is a new input string, and `results` is a list. If `n` is even, `results` contains ['no', 'no']. If `n` is odd and the number of 'U' characters in `arr` is greater than the number of 'D' characters, `results` contains ['yes', 'no'] if `n` is even, or ['yes', 'yes'] if `n` is odd. Otherwise, `results` contains ['no', 'no'] if `n` is even, or ['yes', 'no'] if `n` is odd.** 

The code snippet `arr = input()` updates the value of `arr` to a new input string. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
