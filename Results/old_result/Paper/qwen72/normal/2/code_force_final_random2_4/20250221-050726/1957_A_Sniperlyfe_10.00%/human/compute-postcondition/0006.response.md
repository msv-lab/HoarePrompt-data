Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100, `freq` is a dictionary with the current `n` as a key and 3 as its value, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `n` is the third element in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code updates the frequency of `n` in the `freq` dictionary by incrementing its value by 1. Initially, `freq[n]` was 2, so after the code executes, `freq[n]` becomes 3. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
