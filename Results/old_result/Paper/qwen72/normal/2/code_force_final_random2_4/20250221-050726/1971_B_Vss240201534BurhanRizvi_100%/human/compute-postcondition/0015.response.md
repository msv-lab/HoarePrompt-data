Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the input string (a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters). If the length of `s` is 1, the program does nothing. If the length of `s` is greater than 1, and all characters in `s` are the same, the program does nothing. Otherwise, if `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is now the string formed by moving the first character of `s` to the end. If `s` is not equal to `s2`, `s2` remains a randomly shuffled version of `s`.***
