Output State: **_ is 2, `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`, `i` is 1, `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index 1 to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if `new` is non-decreasing from the second element to the last element, otherwise `False`. Additionally, either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False` (or both). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
