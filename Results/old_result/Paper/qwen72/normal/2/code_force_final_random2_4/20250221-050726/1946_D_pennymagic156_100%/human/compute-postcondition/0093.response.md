Output State: **`u` is 1, `v` is even and non-zero, `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `op` is 0, `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables, `op` and `cnt`, both set to 0. This does not affect the other variables, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state. The values of `u`, `v`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, and `i` remain as they were initially described.
