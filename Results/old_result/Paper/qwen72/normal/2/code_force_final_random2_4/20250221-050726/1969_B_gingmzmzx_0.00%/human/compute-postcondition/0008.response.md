Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input binary string that must have at least 1 element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [1, 0] because `c` is 0, `ans` is 0, and `c` is the first element of the list `s` which is 0.**
