The code `ans.append(1 << j)` appends the value of `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given that `j` is 20, the value `1 << 20` is calculated as \( 1 \times 2^{20} = 1048576 \).

If `j` was not equal to `i`, `ans` was initially `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 524288]`. After appending `1048576`, the new `ans` becomes `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 524288, 1048576]`.

If `j` was equal to `i`, `ans` was initially `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`. After appending `1048576`, the new `ans` becomes `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1048576]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `i` is the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \), `j` is 20, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least \( 2^i \). If `j` was not equal to `i`, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 524288, 1048576]`. Otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1048576]`.**
