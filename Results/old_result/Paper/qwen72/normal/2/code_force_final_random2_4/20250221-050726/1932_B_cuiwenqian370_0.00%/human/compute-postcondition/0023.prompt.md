Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `path` is a string containing `n` space-separated integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), `data` is a list of strings containing the split input, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    path = data[index]
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(path))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index-3]`, `index` is incremented by 2, `path` is `data[index-2]`, `results` now includes the result of `func_1(path)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `n` is the integer value of `data[index-2]`, `index` is incremented by 4, `path` is `data[index-1]`, `results` now includes the result of `func_1(path)` appended to its previous content.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 0 but less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`, `index` is incremented by 6, `path` is `data[index-1]`, `results` now includes the result of `func_1(path)` appended to its previous content.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
