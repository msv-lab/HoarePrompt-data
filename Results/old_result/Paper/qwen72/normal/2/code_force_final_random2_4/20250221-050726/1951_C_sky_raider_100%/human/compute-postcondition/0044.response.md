Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is `k - s - s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input, `t` is `s + t + s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * l[0] + s * (l[1] + t) + s * (l[2] + t)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t + s`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `s`, `c`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `t` is `s + t + s`, which simplifies to `t + 2 * s`.
