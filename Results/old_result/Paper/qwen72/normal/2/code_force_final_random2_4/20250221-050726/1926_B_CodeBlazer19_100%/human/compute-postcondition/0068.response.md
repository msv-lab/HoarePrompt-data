To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop and the initial state:

Given state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `i` is 2
- `n` is a new input integer
- `j` is `n-1`
- `a` is 0
- `b` is an empty string

For loop statement:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `j` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop will execute if `range(n)` generates at least one value. This means `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the necessary states:**
   - Since `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1.
   - The variable `j` is initialized by the loop and will start from 0 (the first value in `range(n)`).

4. **Consider the initial state of other variables:**
   - The initial state of `t`, `i`, `a`, and `b` does not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `t` remains an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `i` remains 2
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `j` will be 0 at the start of the loop
- `a` remains 0
- `b` remains an empty string

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string**
