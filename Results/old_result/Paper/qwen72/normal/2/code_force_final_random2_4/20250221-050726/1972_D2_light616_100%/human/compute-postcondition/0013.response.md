Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, `cnt` is updated to `min(n // 2, m // 2) + min(n // 3, m // 6)` if the GCD of `x` and `y` is 1, otherwise `cnt` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3.
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The condition for updating `cnt` remains the same: if the GCD of `x` (which is 1) and `y` (now 3) is 1, `cnt` is updated to `min(n // 2, m // 2) + min(n // 3, m // 6)`. Since the GCD of 1 and 3 is 1, `cnt` will be updated accordingly.
