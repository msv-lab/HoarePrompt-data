The code snippet `cnt = [0, 0]` reassigns the variable `cnt` to a new list `[0, 0]`. This means that the previous value of `cnt`, which was `[count of 0s in s, count of 1s in s]`, is replaced by `[0, 0]`.

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, and `ans`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input binary string, `n` is 1, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is the sum of `zeroes - cnt[0]` for each 1 in `s` plus the sum of 1 for each 0 in `s` when there is at least one 1 before it.**
