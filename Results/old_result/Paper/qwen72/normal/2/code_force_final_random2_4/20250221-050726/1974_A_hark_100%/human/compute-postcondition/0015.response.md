Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input.
- `ap` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is 0.
- Either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is less than or equal to 0.
- It is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.
- Additionally, either `x` is less than or equal to 0, or `y` is not equal to 0.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(0)
```

This statement simply prints the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
