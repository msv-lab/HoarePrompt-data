To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the variables in the loop head: `j` and `m`.

### Analysis:
- The loop `for j in range(m):` will execute if `m` is greater than 0.
- The variable `j` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

### Given State:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `sum_f` is 0
- `j` is `m - 1`
- `a`, `b`, and `f` are the last set of input integers
- `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`
- `q` is `(2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) // gcd`
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `j` should be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

### Final State:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is 0, `j` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the last set of input integers, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `(2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`**
