Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`, `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, `ln`**: These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`palka`**: This list remains unchanged as it is only iterated over.
- **`pl`**: After the loop completes, `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` because the loop appends each unique element to `pl` if it is not already present.
- **`d`**: The dictionary `d` will contain each element from `palka` as a key, and the value will be the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`.
- **`shapes`**: This variable is determined by counting the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`. Since `pl` contains all unique elements from `palka`, `shapes` will be the number of elements in `pl` that have a count of at least 3 in `d`.
