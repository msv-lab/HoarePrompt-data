Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `i` is the last element in `results`, `n` is the last input integer, `arr` is the last input string, `results` is a list of length `t` and all elements have been printed.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains the same as it was initially (an integer between 1 and 100), `i` is now the last element in the `results` list, `n` is still the last input integer, `arr` is still the last input string, and the `results` list, which has a length of `t`, has had all its elements printed out.
