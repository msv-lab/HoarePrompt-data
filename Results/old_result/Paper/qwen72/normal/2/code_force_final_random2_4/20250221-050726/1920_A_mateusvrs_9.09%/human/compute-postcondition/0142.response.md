The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the set `cx`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx`. If `cx` contains more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next value from the set `cx`, and `cx` must contain at least one unique `x` value where `a` was neither 1 nor 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `cx` must still contain at least one more unique `x` value, and `i` should be the next value from this set.

State: **_ is n-1, n is the input integer, t is greater than 0, a and x are integers provided by user input, cx is a set containing at least two unique x values where a was neither 1 nor 2, ax is the minimum value of all x values where a was 2, bx is the maximum value of all x values where a was 1, tmp is 1 if the current value of i is outside the range [bx, ax] and 2 if the current value of i is within the range [bx, ax], i is the next value from the set cx**
