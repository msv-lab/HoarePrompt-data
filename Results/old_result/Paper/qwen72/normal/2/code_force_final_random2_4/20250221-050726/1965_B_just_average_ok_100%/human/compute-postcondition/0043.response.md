The code snippet `nums.append(k + 1)` appends the value `k + 1` to the list `nums`. This impacts the length of `nums` and potentially the value of `i` and `idx` if the new element is greater than `k`.

- Initially, `nums` contains integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) and an additional element `k - nums[idx]`.
- After appending `k + 1`, the length of `nums` increases by 1.
- The value of `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k` or `len(nums)` if no such element exists. Since `k + 1` is greater than `k`, `i` will now be the index of `k + 1` in the list.
- The value of `idx` is `i - 1` if `i` is less than `len(nums)`, otherwise `idx` is -1. Since `i` is now the index of `k + 1`, which is within the bounds of `nums`, `idx` will be `i - 1`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `nums` now includes the value `k + 1` at the end.
- `i` is the index of `k + 1` in `nums`.
- `idx` is `i - 1`.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) with the value `k - nums[idx]` appended at the end, followed by `k + 1`, `i` is the index of `k + 1` in `nums`, `idx` is `i - 1`.**
