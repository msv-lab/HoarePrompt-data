Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `0 + f`, `j` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the new input integers, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * (0 + f) + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `(2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sum_f` is updated to `0 + f`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`) remain unchanged, but the expression for `p` now includes the updated value of `sum_f` which is `0 + f`.
