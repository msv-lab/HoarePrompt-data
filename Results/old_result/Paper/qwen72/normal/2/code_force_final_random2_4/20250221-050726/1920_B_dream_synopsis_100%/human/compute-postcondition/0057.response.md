The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Here's the detailed output state:

- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` remains 1.
- `n` remains the user-provided integer.
- `k` remains the user-provided integer.
- `x` remains the user-provided integer.
- `a` remains a sorted list of integers provided by the user input but now reversed.
- `sum1` remains the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `i` remains not 0.
- `i + x - 1` remains greater than or equal to `n`.
- `sums` remains updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.
- `ans` now contains the value of `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the user-provided integer, `k` is the user-provided integer, `x` is the user-provided integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is not 0, `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`.**
