Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples (n, m, k, a, b), `results` is a list. If the number of elements in `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`, `results` contains the string 'NO'. If the number of elements in `only_b` is not greater than `k // 2` and `total_distinct` is less than `k`, `results` contains the string 'YES'. `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `total_distinct` by summing the lengths of the sets `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. The values of `t`, `cases`, `results`, `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` remain unchanged. The only updated variable is `total_distinct`, which now holds the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`.
