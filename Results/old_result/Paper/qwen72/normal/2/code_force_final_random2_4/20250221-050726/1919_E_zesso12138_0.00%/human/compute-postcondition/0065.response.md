Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is still a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1, `offset` is still equal to `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1 initialized to all zeros except `new_dp[2]` which is now `(dp[1] % MOD)`, and `j` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `new_dp[j + 1]` which is `new_dp[2]` since `j` is 1.
- The new value of `new_dp[2]` is calculated as `(new_dp[2] + dp[1]) % MOD`.
- Since `new_dp` was initially all zeros, `new_dp[2]` becomes `dp[1] % MOD`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
