The code snippet `cx.add(x)` suggests that `cx` is a collection (like a set, list, or similar) and the method `add` is used to add the value of `x` to this collection. Since the initial state specifies that `x` is an integer provided by user input, and no changes to `n` or `a` are made, these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `a` is not equal to 1, `a` is not equal to 2, `x` has been added to the collection `cx`.**
