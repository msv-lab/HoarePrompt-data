Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Specifically, the issue lies in how the function `func_1` handles the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` before each removal operation. According to the problem, the program should output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` before each command is executed, and then remove the corresponding element based on the command ('L' or 'R'). However, the function `func_1` incorrectly appends the elements being removed to a list `b` and then calculates the cumulative product of these elements in reverse order, which does not match the required behavior.

To fix this, the function should maintain a running product of the elements in the array `a` and update this product appropriately after each removal. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    product = 1
    for x in a:
        product = (product * x) % m
    for i in range(n):
        b.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[l], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove the leftmost element
            l += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[r], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove the rightmost element
            r -= 1
    return b
```

In this corrected version:
- We initialize `product` to the product of all elements in `a` modulo `m`.
- For each command, we append the current `product` to the list `b`.
- If the command is 'L', we remove the leftmost element by dividing the `product` by `a[l]` using modular inverse.
- If the command is 'R', we remove the rightmost element by dividing the `product` by `a[r]` using modular inverse.
- The modular inverse is calculated using `pow(a[l], m-2, m)` or `pow(a[r], m-2, m)` based on Fermat's Little Theorem, which works because `m` is a prime number (or can be assumed to be a prime for simplicity).

Given the original program's incorrect handling of the product and removal operations, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
