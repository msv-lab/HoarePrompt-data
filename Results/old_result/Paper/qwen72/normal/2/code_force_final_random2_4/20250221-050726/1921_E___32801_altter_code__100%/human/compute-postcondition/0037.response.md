The code `y1 -= a` modifies the value of `y1` by subtracting the value of `a` from it. Let's go through the changes step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `n` is `r[0]`
   - `m` is `r[1]`
   - `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`
   - `x2` is `r[4] - a`
   - `y2` is 1
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`
   - The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`
   - `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`
   - `y1` is `r[3] + 1`
   - `a` is `r[5] - 1`
   - `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, which is an odd number
   - `t` is `abs(r[5] - y1)`
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`
   - `x1` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `x2` is less than or equal to `n`

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - `y1` is updated to `y1 - a`
   - `a` is `r[5] - 1`
   - Therefore, `y1` becomes `r[3] + 1 - (r[5] - 1)`, which simplifies to `r[3] + 1 - r[5] + 1` or `r[3] - r[5] + 2`

3. **Updated Values:**
   - `y1` is now `r[3] - r[5] + 2`

4. **Remaining Unchanged Values:**
   - `n` is `r[0]`
   - `m` is `r[1]`
   - `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`
   - `x2` is `r[4] - a`
   - `y2` is 1
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`
   - The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`
   - `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`
   - `a` is `r[5] - 1`
   - `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, which is an odd number
   - `t` is `abs(r[5] - y1)`
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`
   - `x1` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `x2` is less than or equal to `n`

Output State: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is 1, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`, `y1` is `r[3] - r[5] + 2`, `a` is `r[5] - 1`, `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, which is an odd number, `t` is `abs(r[5] - y1)`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.**
