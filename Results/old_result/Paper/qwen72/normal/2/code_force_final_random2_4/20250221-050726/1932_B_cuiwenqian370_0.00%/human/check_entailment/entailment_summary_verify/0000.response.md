Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not align with the problem description. The problem requires calculating the year in which the nth sign will occur, considering that signs occur sequentially and strictly after the previous sign. However, `func_1` is designed to process a string of characters ('@' and '*') and calculate a score based on these characters, which is entirely unrelated to the problem of finding the year of the nth sign. Similarly, `func_2` reads input and applies `func_1` to the input, but it does not handle the periodicities of the signs as required by the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the specified task.

Final: **False**
