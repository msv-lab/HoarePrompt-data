The value of `x1` is incremented by `a`. To determine the new value of `x1`, we need to consider the value of `a` based on the conditions given:

- If `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, then `a` is `y1 - 1`.
- If `y2` is less than `y1`, then `a` is `m - y1`.

Given these conditions, the new value of `x1` will be `x1 + a`.

The rest of the variables (`n`, `m`, `y1`, `y2`, `x2`, `b`, `t`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `x1 + a` (where `a` is `y1 - 1` if `y2 >= y1`, or `m - y1` if `y2 < y1`), `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`**.
