The code snippet `pk = n // 2` performs integer division of `n` by 2 and assigns the result to the variable `pk`. Since `n` is given as an odd integer, the result of `n // 2` will be the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2`.

Given that `n` is odd, `n // 2` will always result in an integer that is one less than half of `n` when `n` is divided by 2.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and is odd, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2` (an integer less than or equal to `n / 2`).**
