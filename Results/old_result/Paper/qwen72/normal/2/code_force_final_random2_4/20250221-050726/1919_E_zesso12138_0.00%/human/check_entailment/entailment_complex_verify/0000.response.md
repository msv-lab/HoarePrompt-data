### Reasoning:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The `func_1` function uses a dynamic programming (DP) approach to count the number of ways to form the given prefix sum array `p` from an array `a` consisting of only 1 and -1.
   - The `dp` array is initialized with a length of `2 * n + 1` to handle all possible prefix sums, including negative ones. The `offset` variable is used to shift the indices so that they are non-negative.
   - The DP table is updated iteratively for each element in the array `a`. For each position `i`, the program updates the `new_dp` array based on the previous state `dp`. This ensures that the number of ways to reach each prefix sum is correctly calculated.

2. **Offset Handling**:
   - The `offset` variable is set to `n`, which effectively shifts the indices of the `dp` array to handle negative prefix sums. For example, if `n = 5`, the prefix sum of -1 is stored at index `4` (i.e., `-1 + 5`).

3. **State Transition**:
   - The state transition is correctly implemented. For each position `i`, the program updates the `new_dp` array based on the previous state `dp`. Specifically, if `dp[j]` is greater than 0, it means there are `dp[j]` ways to reach the prefix sum `j - n`. The program then updates `new_dp[j + 1]` and `new_dp[j - 1]` to account for the next step being +1 or -1, respectively.

4. **Final Result Calculation**:
   - The final result is calculated by checking the value in the `dp` array corresponding to the final prefix sum `p[-1]` plus the offset. This correctly gives the number of ways to form the given prefix sum array `p`.

5. **Input Handling**:
   - The `func_2` function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases. It splits the input into individual test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, storing the results and printing them at the end.
   - The input handling is robust and handles the constraints specified in the problem description.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as the smallest possible input (`n = 1`) and larger inputs within the constraints. It also correctly handles cases where the prefix sum array `p` is already sorted and valid.
   - For example, when `n = 1` and `p = [0]`, the program correctly returns `0` because there is no way to form a prefix sum of `0` with an array of length 1 consisting of only 1 and -1.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the detailed analysis of the program, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the solution for the given problem and handles all edge cases and constraints.

Final: **True**
