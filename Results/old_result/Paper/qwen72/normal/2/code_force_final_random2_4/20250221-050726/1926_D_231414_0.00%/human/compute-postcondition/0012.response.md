The value of `ans` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `dic` is a dictionary with `s` as a key and its value decreased by 1, `ans` is equal to `n - 1`, `check` is 2147483647, `i` is the first element of `data`, `s` is the result of `i` XOR 2147483647.**
