The code snippet `a = l[0]` assigns the first element of the list `l` to the variable `a`. This changes the value of `a` from being a list of `n` integers to being the first integer in the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is the first integer in the list `l`, `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**
