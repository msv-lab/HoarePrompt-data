Output State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `w` is the square root of `q`, `i` is 4, and `M` remains as `[1, q, 2, 3]` or `[1, q, 2, q // 2, 3]` or `[1, q, 2, 3, q // 3]` or `[1, q, 2, q // 2, 3, q // 3]` depending on the initial conditions.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 3 to 4. The values of `q`, `x`, and `w` remain unchanged. The list `M` also remains unchanged based on the initial conditions.
