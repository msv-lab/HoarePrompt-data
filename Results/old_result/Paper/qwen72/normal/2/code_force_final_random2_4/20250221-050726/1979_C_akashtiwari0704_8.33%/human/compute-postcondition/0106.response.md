Postcondition: ***`sumo` is the sum of the updated values of the first `bets` elements in `a` (each updated to `prod // a[i]`), `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is 2, `bets` is an integer input by the user that must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `prod` is the product of all elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, `i` is `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no additional changes are made. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is the string representation of all elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets - 1`, each followed by a space.***
