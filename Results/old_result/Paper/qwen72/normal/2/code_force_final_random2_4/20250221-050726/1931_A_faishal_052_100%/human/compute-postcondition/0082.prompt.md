Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `lex` is an input integer, `info` is [[1, 1, 1, lex - 3]] if `lex` is less than 28; `info` is [[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]] if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive); `info` is [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]] if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive) or greater than 78, `arr` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `arr` is updated based on the value of `lex`. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is decremented by 1, `info` is updated to [[1, 1, 1, lex - 4]], and `arr` is set to [1]. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `info` is set to [[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]], and `arr` is set to [26]. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `info` is set to [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]], and `arr` is set to [26]. If `lex` is greater than 78, `info` remains [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]], and `arr` remains an empty list. In all cases, `lex` is adjusted to be within the range [26, 52] if it was initially between 52 and 78.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `lex` is adjusted to be within the range [0, 26] if it was initially between 52 and 78. If `lex` is less than 28, `info` is updated to [[1, 1, 1, lex - 4]], and `arr` is set to [1]. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `info` is set to [[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]], and `arr` is set to [26]. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `info` is set to [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]], and `arr` is set to [26]. If `lex` is greater than 78, `info` remains [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]], and `arr` remains an empty list. In all cases, `lex` is now `lex - 1` if it was less than 28, otherwise `lex` is adjusted to be within the range [26, 52] if it was initially between 52 and 78.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `lex` is adjusted as follows: if `lex` was initially less than 28, it is now `lex - 1`; if `lex` was initially between 52 and 78, it is adjusted to be within the range [26, 52]; otherwise, `lex` remains unchanged. `info` is updated to [[1, 1, 1, lex - 4]] if `lex` was initially less than 28, to [[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]] if `lex` was between 28 and 51 (inclusive), to [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]] if `lex` was between 52 and 78 (inclusive) or greater than 78. `arr` is set to [1] if `lex` was initially less than 28, to [26] if `lex` was between 28 and 51 (inclusive) or between 52 and 78 (inclusive), and remains an empty list if `lex` was greater than 78.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
