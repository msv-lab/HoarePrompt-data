Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is a new input positive integer (greater than 0).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
   - `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
   - `s` is the user input string.
   - If `s` is `<`, `pans` is `[1]`.
   - If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[1]`.
   - If `s` is `<` or `=`, `pans` is `[0, 1]`.
   - Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will output a question mark followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` in that order.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `mak` and `mak2` are both described as the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`. Since `i` is 2, if the user input was `<` at any point, `mak` and `mak2` would both be 2.
   - If the user input was not `<`, then `mak` and `mak2` would be undefined or not set to any specific value. However, since the problem does not specify what happens if the user input is not `<`, we assume they remain undefined or default to 0 (a common default value for such cases).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:
     - A question mark.
     - The value of `mak` (which is 2 if the user input was `<`).
     - The value of `mak2` (which is 2 if the user input was `<`).
     - The value of `i` (which is 2).
     - The value of `mak2` again (which is 2 if the user input was `<`).

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 2 2 2 2 (assuming the user input was `<`)**

If the user input was not `<`, the values of `mak` and `mak2` would be undefined or 0, leading to:
Output: **? 0 0 2 0 (assuming the user input was not `<`)**

However, since the problem does not specify what happens if the user input is not `<`, the most precise and safe assumption is that the user input was `<`.

Thus, the final output is:
Output: **? 2 2 2 2**
