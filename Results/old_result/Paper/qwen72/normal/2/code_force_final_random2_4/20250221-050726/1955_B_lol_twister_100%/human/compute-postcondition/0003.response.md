To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for h in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `h` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. This is because `range(0, n)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and this sequence will be non-empty if `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Initial State Given:**
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
   - `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6.
   - `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
   - `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`.
   - `li` is an empty list.
   - `k` is 0.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `n` is already given to be between 2 and 500, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n`.
   - The variable `h` is initialized by the loop itself and will start at 0.

### Conclusion:
Given that `n` is already within the range 2 to 500, the loop will always execute at least once. No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is an empty list, `k` is 0, `h` is 0**
