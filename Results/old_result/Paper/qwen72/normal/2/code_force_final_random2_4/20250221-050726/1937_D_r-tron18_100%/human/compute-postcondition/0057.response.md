Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0 and now contains [0, `i + 1`], `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0 except for the element at index `i` which is set to `zeroInd - oneInd`, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the second-to-last character of `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1, `zeroInd` is 2 * `func_1(suffZero, totalOne + 1)` - `func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is 2 * `preOne[-1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the element at index `i` in the list `ans` to the value `zeroInd - oneInd`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The specific value of `ans[i]` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are derived from the functions `func_1` applied to the lists `suffZero` and `preOne` respectively.
