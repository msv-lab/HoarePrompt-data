Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition `b <= a` holds true.
- If `b` is greater than `a`, the condition `b > a` holds true.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a * n)
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply multiplies the value of `a` by the value of `n` and prints the result.
- The values of `a` and `n` are input integers, and `n` is specified to be greater than 0.
- The conditions involving `b` and `k` do not affect the value of `a * n` directly, so they are not relevant to the output of the `print` statement.

### Output:
The code will print the product of `a` and `n`, where `a` is the input integer and `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
Output: **a * n (where a is the input integer and n is an input integer greater than 0)**
