The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `results`. If `results` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` must be a list with at least 2 elements, and `result` is the second element in `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least 3 elements, and `result` will be the third element in `results`.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `index` is 1, `path` is `data[0]`, `results` must be a list with at least 3 elements, `result` is the third element in `results`**
