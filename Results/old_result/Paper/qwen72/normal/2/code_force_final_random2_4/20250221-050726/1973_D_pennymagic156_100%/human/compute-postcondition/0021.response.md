Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, and `i` is 0.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will have decremented from `n` down to 1. If at any point during these iterations, the value of `v` (which is updated by `func_2()`) equals `n`, then `v` is set to the current value of `i` and the loop breaks. If no such `i` exists where `v` equals `n`, then `v` remains 1 (its initial value) and the loop completes all iterations, setting `i` to 0. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
