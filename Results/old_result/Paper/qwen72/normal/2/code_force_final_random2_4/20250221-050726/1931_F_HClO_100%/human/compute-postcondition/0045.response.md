Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `i` is 0, and the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, and if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative (i.e., `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`), then `idx1` is 0, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither of these conditions is met, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain as they were before the if statement.**
