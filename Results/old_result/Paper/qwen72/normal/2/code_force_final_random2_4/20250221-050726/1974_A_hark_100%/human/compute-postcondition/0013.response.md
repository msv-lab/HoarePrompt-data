Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user input.
- `ap` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `x` is greater than 0 while `y` is 0.
- It is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.

Given these conditions, the relevant part for the `print` statement is the value of `x`. Since `x` is greater than 0, we need to determine the value of `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Value of `x`**: According to the precondition, `x` is a positive integer.
2. **Expression `x / 15`**: This divides `x` by 15.
3. **Ceiling Function `math.ceil(x / 15)`**: This rounds up the result of `x / 15` to the nearest integer.

Since `x` is a positive integer, `x / 15` will be a positive number. The `math.ceil` function will round this up to the nearest integer.

### Example Values:
- If `x = 1`, then `x / 15 = 0.0667`, and `math.ceil(0.0667) = 1`.
- If `x = 15`, then `x / 15 = 1.0`, and `math.ceil(1.0) = 1`.
- If `x = 30`, then `x / 15 = 2.0`, and `math.ceil(2.0) = 2`.

### General Case:
For any positive integer `x`, the value of `math.ceil(x / 15)` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x / 15`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the ceiling of `x / 15`.

Output: **math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is a positive integer provided by the user input)**
