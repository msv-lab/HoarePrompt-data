Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `m` must be at least 1, and `i` is the third character of `s`. If the length of `alphabet` is not 1, `i` has been removed from the list `alphabet`. Otherwise, `s2` is now the original value of `s2` plus the third character of `s`, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.***
