The code snippet `hmp = Counter(s)` creates a dictionary-like object named `hmp` that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `ans`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `ans` is 0, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in `s`.**
