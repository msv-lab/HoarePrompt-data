Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It processes multiple test cases, reads the input data, and applies a logical check to determine if it's possible to select the required elements from the two arrays to cover all integers from 1 to \(k\). The solution uses sets to efficiently manage and compare the unique elements from both arrays, and it correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
