The provided code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that all output is written immediately. This operation does not alter any of the variables in the current state.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 1), `i` is 2, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 1 and `pans` is `[1]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[1]`. For any other value of `s`, `pans` is `[0]` if `s` is `<`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list.**
