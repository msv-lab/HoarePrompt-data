Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `1000000000.0 + 7` to the variable `ax`, which results in `ax` being 1000000007. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
