Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `kp` is 2.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement will output a string in the format `! {prev} {v1}`.
   - `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`.
   - `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`.

4. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since the initial state does not specify any specific inputs that would change `prev` or `v1`, we assume that no inputs have been `<` or `>`.
   - Therefore, both `prev` and `v1` will be 0.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output `! 0 0`.

Output: **! 0 0**
