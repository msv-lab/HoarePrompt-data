The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the problem description, it implicitly accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: A positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of chat participants.
  - `k`: An integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the number of participants who posted screenshots.
  - `a`: A list of lists, where each inner list contains `n` integers (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n, all a_{ij} are distinct) representing the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0}, who is the author of the screenshot. All authors of the screenshots are different.

The function processes each test case and returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and indicates the order of participants shown to the author of each screenshot.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of lists `a` representing the order of participants shown to the author of each screenshot. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and indicates the order of participants shown to the author of each screenshot.**
