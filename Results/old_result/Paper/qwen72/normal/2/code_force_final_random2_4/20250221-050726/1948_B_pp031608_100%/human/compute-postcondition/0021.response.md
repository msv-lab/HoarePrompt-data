The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the parameters `m` and `0`. Therefore, we can only adjust `i` since `m` and `0` are constants and cannot change.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 to `m - 3`, and it must still be greater than or equal to 1 (since the loop runs while `i` is greater than 0).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, and `i` is `m - 3`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. The value of `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`, and the value of `arr[i]` is less than the new value of `arr[i - 1]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, no changes are made to `arr` or `ans`.**
