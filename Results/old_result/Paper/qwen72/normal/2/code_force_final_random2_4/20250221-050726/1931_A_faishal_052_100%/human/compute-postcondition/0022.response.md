Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `lex` is `lex - 1`, and `arr` is updated as follows: if `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is `[1, 1]`; if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 1]`; if `lex` is greater than 51, `arr` is `[1]` if `lex` is greater than 78, otherwise `arr` is `[26, 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `lex` is decremented by 1.
- The conditions for updating `arr` remain the same, but they now depend on the new value of `lex` which is `lex - 1`.
- The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
