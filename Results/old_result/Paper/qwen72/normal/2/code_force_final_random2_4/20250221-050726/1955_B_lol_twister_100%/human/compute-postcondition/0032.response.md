Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a sorted list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a sorted list of n^2 elements. The elements of `li` are arranged in ascending order, and `l` is not equal to `li`.***
