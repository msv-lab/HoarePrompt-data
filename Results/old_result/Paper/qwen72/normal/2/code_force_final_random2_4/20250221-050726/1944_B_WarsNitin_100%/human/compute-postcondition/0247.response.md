Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 4. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans1` now includes the element at index 3 of `b`.** 

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element at index 3 of the list `b` to the list `ans1`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition for `k` remain unchanged. The only change is that `ans1` now includes the element at index 3 of `b`.
