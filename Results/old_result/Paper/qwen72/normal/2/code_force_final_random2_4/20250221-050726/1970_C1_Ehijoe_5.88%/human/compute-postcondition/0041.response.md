Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `i` is 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque. If `empty` is True, `tree` contains `u` and `v`. Otherwise, if `v` equals the first element of `tree`, then `u` is added to the left side of `tree`. If `v` equals the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `u`. If `u` equals the first element of `tree`, then `v` is added to the left side of `tree`. If `u` equals the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `v`. If none of these conditions are met, the conditions related to `tree` and `u`, `v` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `u, v = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `u` and `v`. This does not affect the other variables or the conditions related to `tree` and `u`, `v`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that `u` and `v` now have specific input values.
