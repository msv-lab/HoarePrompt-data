You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

- Program:
from typing import List
#Function 1:
def func_1(row: List[int], d: int):
    for i in range(0, d - 1):
        row[i] = row[i] + 1
    for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
        row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
    return row[-1]

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (n, m, k, d) = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
    print(min(total_costs))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and a list of `n` lists (`rows`) containing `m` integers each. It then computes a list of costs using the function `func_1` for each row in `rows`. The function calculates the minimum sum of every contiguous subsequence of `k` elements in the `costs` list and prints this minimum sum. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. The input variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows` remain unchanged after the function execution.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges on a grid of size `n x m`.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to install supports for a single row.
   - It iterates through the row and updates the cost for each cell based on the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells plus the current cell's depth plus one.
   - The final cost for the row is the value in the last cell after processing.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and the grid of depths.
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows by summing the costs of these rows and selecting the minimum sum.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Input Handling:** The input is read correctly, and the grid is parsed into a list of lists.
   - **Cost Calculation:** The cost calculation in `func_1` is correct. It ensures that the cost for each cell is the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells plus the current cell's depth plus one.
   - **Consecutive Rows:** The function correctly calculates the total cost for `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The input handling, cost calculation, and finding the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows are all handled correctly.
