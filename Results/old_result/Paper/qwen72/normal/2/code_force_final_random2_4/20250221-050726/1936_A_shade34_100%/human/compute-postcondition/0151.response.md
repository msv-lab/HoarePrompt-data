Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 1), `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call does not change any of the variables in the initial state. It only ensures that any buffered output is written to the terminal or output stream immediately. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
