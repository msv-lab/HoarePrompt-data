### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Calls:**
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the list of integers `nums`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Sum of Digits Lengths (`tot`):**
     - `tot` is initialized as the sum of the lengths of the string representations of the elements in `nums`. This represents the total number of digits in the list.
   - **Count of Trailing Zeros (`cntvals`):**
     - `cntvals` is a list of the counts of trailing zeros for each element in `nums`, sorted in descending order.
   - **Subtracting Trailing Zeros:**
     - The loop iterates over `cntvals` in steps of 2, subtracting the value at each even index from `tot`. This simulates the effect of Sasha's moves, where he concatenates two numbers and reduces the total number of digits by the number of trailing zeros in one of the numbers.
   - **Winning Condition:**
     - The function returns 'Sasha' if `tot` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, indicating that the final number has at least `m + 1` digits. Otherwise, it returns 'Anna'.

3. **Function `zerocnts`:**
   - **Trailing Zeros Count:**
     - This function converts the number to a string and counts the number of trailing zeros.
   - **Return Value:**
     - It returns the count of trailing zeros, which is used in `func_1` to adjust the total number of digits.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the game by considering the total number of digits and the effect of trailing zeros.
- The use of `cntvals` to simulate Sasha's moves is appropriate, as it effectively reduces the total number of digits by the number of trailing zeros in the chosen number.
- The winning condition is correctly implemented, ensuring that the program determines the winner based on the final number of digits.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the game logic and determines the winner based on the given rules and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
