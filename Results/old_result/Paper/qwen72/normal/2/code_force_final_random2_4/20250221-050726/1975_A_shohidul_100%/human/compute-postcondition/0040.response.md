Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `check_all` is `False`, `i` is 3, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 3 to the end. If `a[2] > a[3]`, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is also broken out of.***
