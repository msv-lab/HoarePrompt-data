Postcondition: ***`t` is equal to `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd; `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a` is an integer (converted from its original string value); `b` is an integer (converted from its original string value); `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`; `t1` is less than `a`; `t2` is equal to `a - t1`; `t2` is not divisible by 15***
