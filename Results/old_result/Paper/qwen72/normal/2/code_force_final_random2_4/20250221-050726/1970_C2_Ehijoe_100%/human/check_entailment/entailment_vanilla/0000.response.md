### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - The game is played on a tree with `n` nodes.
   - Each round starts with a stone on a specific node, which is considered active.
   - Players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses the round.
   - The goal is to determine who wins the round if both players play optimally.

2. **Tree Structure and Functionality:**
   - The tree is represented using an adjacency list stored in a `defaultdict`.
   - The function `func_1` is used to determine if the starting node has a winning strategy.
   - `func_1` recursively checks if there is any path from the starting node where the opponent can be forced into a losing position.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It takes the current node, its neighbors, and the parent node as arguments.
   - If the current node is a leaf (i.e., it has only one neighbor, which is the parent), it returns `False` because the player who moves to this node will lose.
   - Otherwise, it recursively checks all neighbors (excluding the parent) to see if any of them lead to a losing position for the opponent.
   - If any neighbor leads to a losing position, it returns `True`, indicating that the current player has a winning move.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - It reads the input values for `n` and `t`.
   - It constructs the tree using the given edges.
   - It identifies the starting node for the round.
   - It calls `func_1` to determine if the starting node has a winning strategy.
   - Based on the result, it prints "Ron" if the starting node has a winning strategy, otherwise it prints "Hermione".

5. **Edge Cases and Correctness:**
   - The program correctly handles the construction of the tree and the recursive check for winning strategies.
   - It correctly identifies leaf nodes and ensures that the recursion does not revisit the parent node.
   - The logic for determining the winner is sound and follows the rules of the game.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
