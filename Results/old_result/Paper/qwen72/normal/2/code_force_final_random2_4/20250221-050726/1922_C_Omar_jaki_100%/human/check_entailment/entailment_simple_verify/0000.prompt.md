You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

    5 1

Output

    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of: n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of cities; a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, representing the positions of the cities on the number line; m is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries; and m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, representing the queries. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The list `a` starts with `-1000000000.0`, followed by the values of `n` integers from each test case, and ends with `2000000000.0`. The list `b` contains `2 * n` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the conditions evaluated during the loop iterations. The variable `u` is 0, indicating that all queries have been processed. The values of `c` and `d` are the final values returned by `r()` during the last iteration of the loop, and they satisfy the condition that if `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`; otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Handling of Closest Cities**: The program does not explicitly handle the concept of finding the closest city for each city. It uses a list `b` to store cumulative distances, but it does not ensure that the closest city is unique for each city, which is a requirement of the problem.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates distances using a complex formula involving powers and comparisons, which is not straightforward and may not correctly reflect the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities.

3. **Query Handling**: The program processes queries by subtracting values from the `b` list, but it does not clearly show how it ensures the minimum number of coins for each query. The logic for handling the queries is not transparent and may not work for all cases.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, it assumes that the closest city is always the next or previous city, which may not be true for all inputs.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails, consider the following input:

```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

Expected output:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the program's logic for calculating the minimum number of coins may not produce the correct results for these queries, especially for the more complex ones like traveling from city 1 to city 5.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
