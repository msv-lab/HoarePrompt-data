Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `i` is 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque containing `u` and `v`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `v` to the deque `tree`, which initially contains `u`. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `i`, `u`, `v`, and `empty`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state reflects the new content of the deque `tree`.
