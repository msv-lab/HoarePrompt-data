To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `_` is 2.
2. `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
3. `n` must be greater than 3.
4. `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
5. `i` is 3.
6. `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 3 to the end.
7. `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`.
8. `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.

The `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of these variables or conditions directly. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print('YES')` statement is:

Output: **YES**
