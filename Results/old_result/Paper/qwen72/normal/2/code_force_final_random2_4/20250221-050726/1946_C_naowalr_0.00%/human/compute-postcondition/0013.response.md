Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a]`, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input.**

Explanation:
- The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`.
- The values of `t`, `z`, `n`, `adj`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The new values of `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input.
