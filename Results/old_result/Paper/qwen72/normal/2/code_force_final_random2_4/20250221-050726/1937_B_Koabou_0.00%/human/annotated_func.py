#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and there are two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}...a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}...a_{2n}, each of length n, consisting of 0s and 1s. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, the loop has completed its execution.
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is either the string formed by concatenating the substring of `a[0]` up to the position where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met with the rest of `a[1]`, or it is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]` if the condition is never met, `x` is the index where the condition is met or `n-1` if the condition is never met.
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `t` remains 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is a string formed based on certain conditions, `x` is the index where the condition is met or `n-1` if the condition is never met, and `i` is `x-1`. If the loop breaks before completing all iterations, `t` is updated to `x - i + 1` where `i` is the index at which the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]` is met, and `i` is the index at which the loop broke.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is the string formed based on the conditions described in the initial state)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1 (if the loop completes all iterations) or x - i + 1 (if the loop breaks at some index i, where x is the index where the condition is met or n-1 if the condition is never met, and i is the index at which the loop broke)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n` from the input. It then processes these strings to form a new string `s` and an integer `t`. The string `s` is constructed by finding the first position where the next character in the first string is '1' and the current character in the second string is '0', and concatenating the prefix of the first string up to this position with the suffix of the second string starting from this position. If no such position is found, `s` is formed by concatenating the entire first string with the last character of the second string. The integer `t` is determined by checking the longest prefix of the first string that matches the corresponding prefix of `s`; if a match is found, `t` is set to the difference between the position where the condition was met and the current index, otherwise, `t` remains 1. The function prints the string `s` and the integer `t`.
