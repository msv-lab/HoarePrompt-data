The code snippet `r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)` appends the result of the expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to the list `r`. Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Expression Calculation**:
   - `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`: This expression calculates the difference between `ax` and `bx`, adds 1, and then subtracts `tmp`.
   - `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` values where `a` was 2.
   - `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` values where `a` was 1.
   - `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.

2. **Appending to List**:
   - The result of the expression is appended to the list `r`.

3. **Variables Affected**:
   - `r` is updated by appending the new value.

4. **Variables Unchanged**:
   - `_` remains `n-1`.
   - `n` remains the input integer.
   - `t` remains greater than 0.
   - `a` and `x` remain integers provided by user input.
   - `cx` remains the set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2.
   - `ax` remains the minimum value of all `x` values where `a` was 2.
   - `bx` remains the maximum value of all `x` values where `a` was 1.
   - `tmp` remains the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **_ is n-1, n is the input integer, t is greater than 0, a and x are integers provided by user input, cx is a set containing all unique x values where a was neither 1 nor 2, ax is the minimum value of all x values where a was 2, bx is the maximum value of all x values where a was 1, tmp is the count of elements in cx that fall within the range [bx, ax], r is the list with the new element (ax - bx + 1 - tmp) appended.**
