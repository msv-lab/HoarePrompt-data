The code snippet `r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)` appends the result of the expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to the list `r`.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Expression Calculation**:
   - `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2.
   - `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1.
   - `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.
   - The expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` calculates the difference between `ax` and `bx`, adds 1, and then subtracts `tmp`.

2. **Appending to List**:
   - The result of the expression is appended to the list `r`.

3. **State Update**:
   - The list `r` now contains one additional element, which is the result of the expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.
   - All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, `cx`, `tmp`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` must contain all elements as initially defined, `bx` is less than `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `r` contains one additional element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**
