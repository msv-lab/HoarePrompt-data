Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, x and y are strings representing integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100 and consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= x < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `y` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= y < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are lists of characters from the input strings, `f` is 1, and `i` is the length of `a` - 1. The elements of `a` and `b` are such that for each index `j` (0 <= j < len(a)), if `a[j]` was originally less than `b[j]` and `f` was 0 at that point, `a[j]` and `b[j]` have been swapped. Otherwise, if `a[j]` was greater than `b[j]` and `f` was 0 at that point, `f` is set to 1 but no swap occurs. If `f` was already 1, then any subsequent elements where `a[j]` > `b[j]` are swapped, and `f` remains 1 throughout the rest of the loop.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= x < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `y` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= y < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are lists of characters from the input strings, `f` is 1, and `i` is the length of `a` - 1, where `len(a)` is the original length of the input string `x`.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= x < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `y` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= y < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are lists of characters from the input strings, `b` has been fully printed, `f` is 1, and `i` is the length of `b` - 1.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two lines of input, each representing a string of digits (1 to 9), and processes them to ensure that the first string is lexicographically not smaller than the second string. It does this by swapping characters at corresponding positions if necessary. After processing, it prints the modified first string, followed by an empty line, and then the modified second string. The function does not return any value. The input parameter `t` is mentioned in the comments but is not used in the function.
