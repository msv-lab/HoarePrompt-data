Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `k` is `req`, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not equal to their immediate next element, provided `k` is not `0` before the loop ends.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to `req`. All other variables (`i`, `ans1`, and `l`) remain unchanged. The conditions for `ans1` and `l` remain the same as described in the initial state.
