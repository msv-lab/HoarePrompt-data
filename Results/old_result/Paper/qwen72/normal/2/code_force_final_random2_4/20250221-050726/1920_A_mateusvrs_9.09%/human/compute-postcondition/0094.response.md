The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `cx`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `cx`. If `cx` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element in `cx`. For the loop to execute one more time, `cx` must have at least three elements, and `i` will be the third element in `cx`.

State: **`n` is 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `bx` is the maximum value encountered among all `x` values where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value encountered among all `x` values where `a` was 2, `cx` is a non-empty list of unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is the third element in `cx`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 2. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 1.**
