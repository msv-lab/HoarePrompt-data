The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`_`, `t`, `a`, `x`, `bx`, `ax`, `cx`, `r`, `i`, `tmp`) remain unchanged from their initial state or conditions.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum value encountered among all `x` values where `a` was 1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum value encountered among all `x` values where `a` was 2. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `cx` contains all unique `x` values encountered where `a` was neither 1 nor 2. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, the list `r` includes the value 0. If `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is the last element in `cx`, `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that satisfy the condition `bx <= i <= ax` if `i` is within the range, otherwise it is the count of such elements up to the last iteration, and `r` is a list containing the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**
