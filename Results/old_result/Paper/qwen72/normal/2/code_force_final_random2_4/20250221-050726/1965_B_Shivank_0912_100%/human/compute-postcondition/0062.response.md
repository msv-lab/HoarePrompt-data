Postcondition: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 2, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\), `j` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, and the list `ans` contains the initial elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` followed by the powers of 2 from `1 << 1` to `1 << 19`. Additionally, `j` is not equal to `i`.**
