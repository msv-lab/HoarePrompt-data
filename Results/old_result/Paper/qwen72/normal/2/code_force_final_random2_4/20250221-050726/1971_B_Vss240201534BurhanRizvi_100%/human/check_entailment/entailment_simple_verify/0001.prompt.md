You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each iteration, `s` was a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. For each `s` input during the loop: If the length of `s` was 1, the program did nothing. If the length of `s` was greater than 1 and all characters in `s` were the same, the program did nothing. Otherwise, `s2` was a shuffled version of `s`. If `s` was equal to `s2`, then `s2` was the string formed by moving the first character of `s` to the end. The loop executed `t` times, and the final state of `s` and `s2` for each iteration depends on the specific input provided.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Single Character Case**: If the length of the string `s` is 1, the program correctly prints "No" because it's impossible to rearrange a single character string to form a different string.

3. **All Characters Identical**: If all characters in the string `s` are the same (i.e., `len(set(s)) == 1`), the program correctly prints "No" because it's impossible to rearrange the string to form a different string.

4. **Random Rearrangement**: For other cases, the program uses `random.sample` to shuffle the characters of the string `s`. This is a valid approach to generate a random permutation of the string.

5. **Ensuring Different String**: After shuffling, the program checks if the shuffled string `s2` is the same as the original string `s`. If they are the same, it manually creates a different string by moving the first character to the end (`s2 = s[1:] + s[0]`). This ensures that the resulting string is different from the original string.

6. **Output**: The program correctly prints "Yes" followed by the rearranged string `s2`.

### Conclusion:
The program handles all edge cases correctly and follows the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
