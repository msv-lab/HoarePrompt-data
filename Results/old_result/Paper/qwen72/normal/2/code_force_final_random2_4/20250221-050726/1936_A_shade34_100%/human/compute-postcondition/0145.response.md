The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that all data written to `stdout` is actually displayed immediately. However, this operation does not affect any of the variables in the current state.

Output State: **_ is 0, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.**
