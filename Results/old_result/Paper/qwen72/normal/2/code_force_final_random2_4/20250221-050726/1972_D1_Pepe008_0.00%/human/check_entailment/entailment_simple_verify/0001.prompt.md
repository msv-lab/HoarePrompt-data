You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    for t in range(T):

        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        'for i in range(1,a+1):\n        for j in range(4,b+1):\n            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:\n                print(i,j)'
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:

    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is a positive integer, `t` is `T - 1`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the last input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) for all valid `i` from 1 to `b` where \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\) for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It initializes a variable `suma` to 0.
   - It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
   - If \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

3. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) is used to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b = i\).
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not directly checked in the loop, but the formula is derived to count valid pairs.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\) by checking the condition before adding to `suma`.
   - The final result is `suma - 1`, which seems to be an adjustment for some off-by-one error or boundary condition.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program's logic and formula seem to be derived correctly to count the valid pairs.
   - However, the commented-out code suggests that there might have been an earlier attempt to directly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), which was later optimized.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program appears to be correctly solving the problem by counting valid pairs using a derived formula.
   - The logic and the formula used are consistent with the problem requirements.
