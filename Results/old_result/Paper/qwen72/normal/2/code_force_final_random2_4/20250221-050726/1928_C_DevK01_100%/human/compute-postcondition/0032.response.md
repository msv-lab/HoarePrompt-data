The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`. Both `q` and `x` are integers, with the constraint that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\). The function returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding quotients, provided the quotients are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`, where `q` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) and `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < q\). It returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding quotients if the quotients are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
