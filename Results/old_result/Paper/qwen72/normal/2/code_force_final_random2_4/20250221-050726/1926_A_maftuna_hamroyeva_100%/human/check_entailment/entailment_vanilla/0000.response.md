### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This is correctly handled using `t = int(input())`.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that iterates `t` times, processing each test case individually. This is done with `for i in range(t):`.

3. **Reading Each String**: Inside the loop, the program reads a string `a` of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. This is correctly handled using `a = input()`.

4. **Counting 'A' and 'B'**: The program initializes two counters, `l` for 'A' and `h` for 'B', both set to 0. It then iterates through each character in the string `a` and increments the appropriate counter based on whether the character is 'A' or 'B'. This is done with the following code:
   ```python
   l = 0
   h = 0
   for j in a:
       if j == 'A':
           l += 1
       else:
           h += 1
   ```

5. **Determining the Most Frequent Character**: After counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', the program checks which counter is greater and prints the corresponding character. If `l` (count of 'A') is greater than `h` (count of 'B'), it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. This is done with:
   ```python
   if l > h:
       print('A')
   else:
       print('B')
   ```

6. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the most frequent character for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all the specified requirements. It reads the input, processes each test case, counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', and outputs the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
