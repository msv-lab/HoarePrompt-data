The code snippet `b = sorted(b)` sorts the list `b` in ascending order. Since `b` was already defined as a sorted list of integers from `a`, this operation does not change the content of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 2, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b` (now incremented by 1), `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b` (now incremented by 1).**
