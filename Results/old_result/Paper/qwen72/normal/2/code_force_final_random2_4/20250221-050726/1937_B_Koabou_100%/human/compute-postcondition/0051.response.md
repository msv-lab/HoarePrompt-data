To determine what will be printed by the `print(s, sep='')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic leading up to the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is either 1 or `x - i + 1`.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5.
- `a` is a list containing two elements where each element is a user input.
- `_` is 1.
- `s` is either an empty list or a concatenated string formed from parts of `a[0]` and `a[1]` based on the conditions in the loop.
- `x` is at least 1.
- `y` is 0.
- `i` is `x - 1` if the loop completes without breaking, or the last value of `i` before the loop broke.
- If the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]` was met during any iteration, `t` is set to `x - i + 1` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `t` remains 1.

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `a` is a list with two elements, both of which are user inputs.
   - `s` starts as an empty list or string.
   - `x` is at least 1.
   - `i` is initialized to `x - 1`.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `x - 1` down to 0.
   - In each iteration, the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, `t` is set to `x - i + 1` and the loop breaks.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, `i` remains `x - 1`.

3. **Formation of `s`**:
   - `s` is formed by concatenating parts of `a[0]` and `a[1]` based on the loop conditions.
   - The exact formation of `s` depends on the user inputs and the loop logic.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(s, sep='')` statement will print the value of `s` without any separators.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the loop logic, the value of `s` will depend on the user inputs and the conditions in the loop. However, since the exact user inputs are not provided, we can only describe the output in general terms.

### Final Output:
Output: **s (where s is the concatenated string formed from parts of a[0] and a[1] based on the conditions in the loop)**
