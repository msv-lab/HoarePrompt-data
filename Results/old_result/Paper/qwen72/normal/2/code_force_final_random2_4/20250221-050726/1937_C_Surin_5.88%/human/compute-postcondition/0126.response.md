Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `g` is 0, `v1` is 3, `i` is 3, `prev` is 0, `v2` is 3, `r` is the user input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` (which is 3) to `v1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state reflects that `v1` is now 3, while all other initial conditions remain valid.
