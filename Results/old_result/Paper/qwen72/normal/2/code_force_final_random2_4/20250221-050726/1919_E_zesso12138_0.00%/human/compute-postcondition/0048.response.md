Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element `dp[j]` is the sum of the number of ways to reach position `j - n` from position `0` using steps of +1 or -1, modulo MOD, `offset` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` initialized to all zeros, `new_dp[1]` is set to `(new_dp[1] + dp[2]) % MOD`, and `j` remains 2.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `new_dp[j - 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to it and taking the result modulo `MOD`.
- Given that `j` is 2, `new_dp[1]` is updated to `(new_dp[1] + dp[2]) % MOD`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
