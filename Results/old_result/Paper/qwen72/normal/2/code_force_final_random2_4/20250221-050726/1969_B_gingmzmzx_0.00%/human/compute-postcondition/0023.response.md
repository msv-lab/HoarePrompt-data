Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input binary string that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `c` is the third element of the list `s`, `cnt` is [3, 0] if the third element of `s` is 0 or [0, 3] if the third element of `s` is 1, and `ans` is updated as follows: If `c` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged if `cnt` is [3, 0], or `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt` is [0, 3]. If `c` is 1, `ans` is updated to `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`.***
