Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is 0
- `casos` must be greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `n` is not equal to 1, 2, or 3
- The current value of `n` is 4

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('..##..##')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'..##..##'` to the console. The values of the variables `c`, `casos`, and `n` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the string being printed is a literal string and does not depend on any of these variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **..##..##**
