Output State: **`k` is 0, `_` is -1, `combined` is now three elements shorter than before and must still contain at least one element, `heap` contains all the elements that were originally in `combined` except the last three, sorted according to the second element of each tuple, `item` is the new last element that was removed from `combined`, `current_profit` is adjusted as follows: if the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]` twice plus `item[0]`; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]` twice plus `item[0]`. If `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is further decreased by `removed_item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. `test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged, and `removed_item` is the item that was removed from `heap` and replaced by the new `item` (if `removed_item` is not None).**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `current_profit += item[0]` adds the value of `item[0]` to `current_profit`.
- The initial adjustment to `current_profit` based on the conditions remains unchanged.
- The final value of `current_profit` is now adjusted by adding `item[0]` to the previously calculated value.
- All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
