To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `kp` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`
- `i` will start at 1 when the loop begins
- `prev` is 0
- `r` is the user input. If `r` is `>`, then `prev` is updated to 1

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive).
- The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Next Iteration State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is 2.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true for the loop to execute again, so `n` must be greater than 2.

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` where the input was `<`, or 0 if no input was `<`, `i` is 2, `prev` is 0, and `r` is the user input. If `r` is `>`, then `prev` is updated to 1.**
