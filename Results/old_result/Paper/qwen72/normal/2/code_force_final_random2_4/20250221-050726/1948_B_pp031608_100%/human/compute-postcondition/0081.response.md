Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n-1 <= 50, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 0, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[-1]` followed by `arr[0]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]` is executed.
- Since `i` is 0, `arr[i - 1]` refers to `arr[-1]`, which is the last element of the list `arr`.
- The digits of `arr[-1]` are extracted and converted to integers, forming a list.
- This list is then concatenated with `[arr[0]]`, resulting in `nums`.
- The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
- If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.
