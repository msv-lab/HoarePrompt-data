### Reasoning:

The original assessment is incorrect in its conclusion. Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided solution step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet, and then remove one coin.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses.
   - The goal is to determine the winner if both players play optimally.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of coins in the wallets.
   - If the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he never loses.
   - If the difference is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by making the difference even after her move.

3. **Solution Analysis**:
   - The provided solution checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

4. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - The solution correctly identifies the winning strategy based on the parity of the difference.
   - The logic is sound because:
     - If the difference is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he never loses.
     - If the difference is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by making the difference even after her move.

5. **Counterexample Re-evaluation**:
   - The counterexample provided in the original assessment (`a = 2`, `b = 2`) is actually a case where the difference is even.
   - According to the solution, the output should be "Bob", which is correct because Bob can always mirror Alice's moves.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is correct. The original assessment incorrectly identified the solution as incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the game mechanics and the importance of parity in determining the winner.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
