Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 40, `m` must be at least 24, `x` is 5, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\). If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.***
