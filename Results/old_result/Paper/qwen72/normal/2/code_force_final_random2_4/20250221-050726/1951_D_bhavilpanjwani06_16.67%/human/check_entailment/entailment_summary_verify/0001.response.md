Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case using a loop. It calls `func_1()` for each test case, which is a good practice for modular code.

2. **Reading Test Case Data**: Inside `func_1()`, the program reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.

3. **Initial Check**: The program checks if `n < k`. If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels, so the program prints "NO". This check is correct.

4. **Exact Match**: If `n == k`, the program prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with the price equal to `n`. This ensures that Alice will buy exactly one jewel, spending all her coins. This is a valid solution.

5. **Greedy Approach**: If `n > k` and `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, the program prints "YES" and sets up two stalls. The first stall has a price of `n - k + 1`, and the second stall has a price of `1`. This ensures that Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels at the first stall and 1 jewel at the second stall, totaling `k` jewels. This logic is correct because:
   - Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels at the first stall, spending `(k - 1) * (n - k + 1)` coins.
   - She will have `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1)` coins left, which is exactly `k - 1` coins.
   - At the second stall, she will buy 1 jewel, spending 1 coin, and thus buy exactly `k` jewels in total.

6. **Remaining Cases**: If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "NO". This is incorrect because it fails to consider other possible configurations of stalls that could allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels. For example, if `n = 255` and `k = 8`, the program should be able to find a valid configuration of stalls, but it incorrectly prints "NO".

Given the above reasoning, the program is indeed incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases where a valid configuration of stalls exists. Specifically, it fails to consider configurations where more than two stalls might be needed to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Final: **False**
