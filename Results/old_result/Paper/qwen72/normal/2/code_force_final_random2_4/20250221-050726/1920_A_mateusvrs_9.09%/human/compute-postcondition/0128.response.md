Postcondition: **_ is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `t` is greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `ax` is 1000000007. If `a` is 1, `bx` is max(x, -1). If `a` is 2, `bx` is -1 and `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. For any other value of `a`, `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, and `ax` is 1000000007.**
