The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `char`, and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 3 characters, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it should be a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000, `i` is 1, `char` is the second character in `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, and `char` is the third character in `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it should be a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000, `i` is 2, `char` is the third character in `s`. If `char` is '(', `balance` is 3. If `char` is ')', `balance` is -3. `details` is a list containing the tuples `(balance, 0, char)`, `(balance, -1, char)`, and `(balance, -2, char)`**
