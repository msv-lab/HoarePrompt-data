Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. The output for the cases where no rearrangement is possible should be "NO" (case-insensitive), but the program outputs "No" which does not match the required format.
2. The use of `random.sample` to generate a new string might not always guarantee a different string from the original, especially for strings with many repeated characters. While the fallback mechanism (`s2 = s[1:] + s[0]`) ensures a different string, it is not necessary to use randomness when a deterministic approach can be used.
3. The condition `elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:` is redundant because if `len(set(s)) == 1`, then `len(s)` must be greater than 1 for the string to have repeated characters. This can be simplified to just checking if all characters are the same.

A corrected version of the program could look like this:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1 or len(set(s)) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Swap the first two characters to ensure the string is different
            s2 = s[1] + s[0] + s[2:]
            print('YES')
            print(s2)
```

This version ensures that:
- The output is "NO" when the string cannot be rearranged.
- A simple and deterministic method is used to rearrange the string, ensuring it is different from the original.
