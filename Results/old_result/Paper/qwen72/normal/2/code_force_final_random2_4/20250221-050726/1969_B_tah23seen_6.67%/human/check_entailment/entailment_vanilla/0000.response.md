Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. Each operation has a cost equal to the length of the substring being shifted.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and calls the function `func_1` to compute the cost.
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the minimum cost to sort the string.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `s` and appends each character of the input string `sChar` to it. This converts the string into a list of characters.
   - **Variables**:
     - `left` and `right` pointers are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively.
     - `cost` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the total cost.
   - **Main Loop**:
     - The loop continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right` and both pointers are within the bounds of the string.
     - If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', a swap is performed between `s[right]` and `s[left]`, and the cost is incremented by `right - left + 1`.
     - The `right` pointer is moved to the next '0' character.
     - The `left` pointer is moved to the next '1' character.
   - **Return Value**: The function returns the total cost.

4. **Logical Flaws**:
   - The logic of swapping elements and moving pointers is not sufficient to ensure that the string is sorted correctly. The algorithm does not consider all possible substrings and their costs effectively.
   - The approach of swapping individual elements does not align with the requirement of performing cyclic shifts on substrings.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the optimal substrings to cyclically shift to achieve the sorted order with the minimum cost.
   - A more efficient approach involves finding the longest prefix that can be shifted to the end to form a sorted string and calculating the cost accordingly.

Given the logical flaws in the provided program, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
