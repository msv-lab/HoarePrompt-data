Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations, so `i` is `n-2`. The values of `idx1` and `idx2` depend on whether the conditions inside the loop were met. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` for any `i`, then both `idx1` and `idx2` are set to that `i` value, and the loop breaks early. If only `l1[i + p1] == a2` is true for any `i`, then `idx1` is set to that `i` value, and `p1` is set to 1. If only `l2[i + p2] == a1` is true for any `i`, then `idx2` is set to that `i` value, and `p2` is set to 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` become non-negative at any point, the loop breaks early. If none of these conditions are met throughout the loop, `idx1` and `idx2` remain -1, and `p1` and `p2` remain 0. All other variables (`_`, `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`) retain their initial values.**
