The function `func_2` takes a list `case` as input, where `case[0]` is an integer representing the number of coins, and `case[1]` is a string of the same length containing only 'U' and 'D'. The function returns 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the string `case[1]` is even, and 'NO' if the number of 'U' characters is odd. The state of the input `case` remains unchanged after the function call.
