The value of `mini` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. The initial value of `mini` is `min(100000000, abs(n // 2 - ele))`. After executing the code, `mini` will be the smaller of these two values. The other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mini` is updated to `min(min(100000000, abs(n // 2 - ele)), abs(pk - ele))`, `lst` must have at least one more element, all other variables remain unchanged.**
