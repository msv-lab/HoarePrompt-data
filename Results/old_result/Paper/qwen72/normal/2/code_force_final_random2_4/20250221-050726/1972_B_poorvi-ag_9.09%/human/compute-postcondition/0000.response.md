Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, and the function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins.**
