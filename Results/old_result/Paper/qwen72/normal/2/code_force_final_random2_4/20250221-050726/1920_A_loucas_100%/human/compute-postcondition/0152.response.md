Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by a set of constraints. For each test case, it reads the number of constraints and then processes each constraint to determine the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints. Specifically, it calculates the range of valid `k` values based on the minimum of "less than" constraints and the maximum of "greater than" constraints. It then subtracts the count of "not equal" constraints that fall within this range. The function prints the number of valid `k` values for each test case. If no valid `k` exists, it prints 0. The function does not return any values; it only prints results to the console. **
