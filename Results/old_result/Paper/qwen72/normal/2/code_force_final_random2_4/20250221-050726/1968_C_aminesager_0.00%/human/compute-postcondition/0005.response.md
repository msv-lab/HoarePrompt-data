The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` converts the string `line` into a list of integers, where each element of the list is an integer obtained by splitting the string `line` at whitespace and converting each resulting substring to an integer.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, representing the number of remaining test cases.
- `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
- For each test case, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500.
- The sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `line` is a string containing the input provided by the user.

After executing the code:
- `T` is now a list of integers, where each integer is derived from the corresponding part of the string `line` after splitting it by whitespace and converting each part to an integer.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, for each test case, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `line` is a string containing the input provided by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from `line`.**
