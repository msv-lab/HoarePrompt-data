Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 3, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 3 to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
