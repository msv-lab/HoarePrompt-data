The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2. If the minimum value between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to this minimum value. Otherwise, `max` remains 0.**
