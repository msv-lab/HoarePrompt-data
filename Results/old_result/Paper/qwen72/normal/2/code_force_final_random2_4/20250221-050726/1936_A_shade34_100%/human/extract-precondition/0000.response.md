Precondition: **The function operates in an environment where it can interactively query a system to compare bitwise OR results of elements from a hidden permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, and it must find a pair of indices (i, j) that maximize the bitwise XOR of the elements at those indices, using at most 3n queries. The function handles multiple test cases, each with a different permutation of size n, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.**
