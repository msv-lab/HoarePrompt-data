The variables in the loop head are `new_median` and `median`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the comparison between `new_median` and `median`. If `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `new_median` is equal to `median`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `new_median` must be adjusted to a value that is still less than or equal to `median`. Since `new_median` is already equal to `median`, no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of integers extracted from the digit strings in `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 1, `b` is a sorted version of `a`, `ma` is either `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd, `median` is the value of `b[ma]`, `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]`**
