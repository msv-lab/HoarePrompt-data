Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the given string, and then outputs the character that appears more frequently. The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, printing the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
