Output State: **The program returns True**. This indicates that the condition specified in the return statement is met, confirming that `sortedPassword` is indeed equal to `password`. Given the initial state, this means that the string `password`, which consists of lowercase Latin letters and digits, when its digits and letters are sorted and concatenated in the same order as they appear in `password`, results in a string that is identical to `password`.
