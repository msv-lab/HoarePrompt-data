Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 <= n <= 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an input integer, the second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `_` is 1, `T` must be greater than 0, `list0` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is `x - 2`, `count` is the number of times consecutive integers (with a difference of 1) appear in `list0` minus the number of elements in `list0`, `num` is `n - list0[-1]`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `num = n - list0[-1]` calculates the difference between `n` and the last element of `list0`, which is stored in the variable `num`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
