Postcondition: ***`k` is 0, `_` is -1, `combined` is now two elements shorter than before, `heap` contains all the elements that were originally in `combined` except the last two, sorted according to the second element of each tuple, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`, `current_profit` is adjusted as follows: if the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]` twice; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]` twice. If `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is further decreased by `removed_item[0]`. `max_profit` is the maximum of the original `max_profit` and the updated `current_profit`. `test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged, and `removed_item` is the item that was removed from `heap` and replaced by `item` (if `removed_item` is not None).***
