The value of `sunks` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the condition, `sunks` is either 1, 2, or 3. If `k` is 0, the program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `a[r]` is less than the value of `a[l]`. The current value of `k` is `k - 2 * a[r]`. The value of `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is either 1 or 2, `sunks` is either 2, 3, or 4, and `a[l]` is 0.**
