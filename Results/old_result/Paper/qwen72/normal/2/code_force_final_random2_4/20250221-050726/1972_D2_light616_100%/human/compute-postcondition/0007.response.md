Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `func_1()` has been called `t` times.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the input integer `t` must have been at least 1, and the function `func_1()` will have been called exactly `t` times. The value of `t` itself remains unchanged from its initial value, but the function `func_1()` will have executed as many times as specified by `t`.
