The code snippet `ans.append(k - sum(ans))` appends the difference between `k` and the sum of the current elements in `ans` to the list `ans`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `ans` initially contains the value `(1 << i) - 1`.
- `sum(ans)` calculates the sum of the current elements in `ans`.
- `k - sum(ans)` computes the difference between `k` and the sum of the current elements in `ans`.
- This difference is appended to `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `l1` is a list of strings from the new input.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `arr` is an empty list.
- `k0` is equal to `k`.
- `ans` contains the value `(1 << i) - 1`.
- `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`.
- `temp` is \(2^i\).

The updated state after executing the code snippet:

- `ans` now contains two elements: `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the new input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`, `_` is incremented by 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` contains the values `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`, and `temp` is \(2^i\).**
