Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from user input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The initial state conditions about `t` being greater than 1 and `i` being 1 remain unchanged. The condition regarding the absolute difference between `a` and `b` (whether it is even or odd) remains valid as it depends on the new values of `a` and `b` provided by the user.
