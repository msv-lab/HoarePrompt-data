The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ele` and the list `lst`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If `lst` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` must have at least one more element. For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must have at least two more elements (one for the current iteration and one for the next). The variable `ele` will be set to the next element in the list.

State: **`mini` is updated to `min(min(100000000, abs(n // 2 - ele)), abs(pk - ele))`, `lst` must have at least two more elements, all other variables remain unchanged.**
