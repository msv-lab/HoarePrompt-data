The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i` (so `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2. If the minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is greater than the previous `max`, then `max` is updated to this minimum value. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.**
