Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. It processes the list `a` based on the directions given in the string `s` ('L' or 'R') to create a new list `b` with elements from `a` in a modified order. It then computes the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order and returns this list. The returned list has `n` elements, each representing the product of all elements in `b` from that position to the end. **
