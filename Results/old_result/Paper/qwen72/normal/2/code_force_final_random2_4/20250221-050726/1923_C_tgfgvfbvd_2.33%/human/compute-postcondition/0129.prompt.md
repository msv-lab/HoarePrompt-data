Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; c is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; q queries are provided, each consisting of two integers l_i and r_i where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = []
    c = 0
    for x in l:
        c += x
        p.append(c)
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        s = p[b - 1]
        if a - 2 >= 0:
            s -= p[a - 2]
        if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `m`, `n` and `m` are integers based on user input, `l` is a list of integers based on user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in `l`. For each iteration from 0 to `m-1`, `a` and `b` are integers based on user input. If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains equal to `p[b - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `_` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, and `s` is updated based on the conditions within the loop. For each iteration, `s` is set to `p[b - 1]`, and if `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is adjusted by subtracting `p[a - 2]`. The loop checks if `(b - a + 1) > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, printing 'YES' if true, otherwise 'NO'. The final state of `s` after all iterations will depend on the last values of `a` and `b` provided during the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is m-1, m is 0, a and b are the final input integers, n and m are now the integers from the input split by space, l is a list of integers from the input, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in l, c is equal to the sum of all elements in the list l, x is the last element of the list l. If a - 2 >= 0, s is equal to p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]. Otherwise, s is equal to p[b - 1]. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
