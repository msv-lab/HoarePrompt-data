The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the context provided, it is implied that the function processes a range of folder names from `start` to `end`, where both `start` and `end` are integers and `start <= end`. These folders are named with digits and may contain `.html` files.

Functionality: **The function processes a range of folder names from `start` to `end`, where `start` and `end` are integers and `start` is less than or equal to `end`. It checks each folder in this range for the presence of `.html` files.**
