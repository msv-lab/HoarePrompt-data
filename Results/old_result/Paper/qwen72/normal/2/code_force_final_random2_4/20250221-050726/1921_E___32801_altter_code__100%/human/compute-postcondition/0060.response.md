Output State: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2]`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, and if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, then `a` is `y1 - 1`; otherwise, if `y2` is less than `y1`, then `a` is `m - y1`.**
