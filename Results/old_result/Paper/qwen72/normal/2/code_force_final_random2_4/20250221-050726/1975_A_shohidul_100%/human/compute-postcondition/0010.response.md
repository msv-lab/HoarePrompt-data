Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not non-decreasing, `i` is 1, `new` is a list containing elements from `a` starting from index 1 to the end, and the current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than the current value of `a[i]`.**
