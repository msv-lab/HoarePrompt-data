The function processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000). For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. If the string `s` contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by either the string `s` sorted in descending order (if `s` is already sorted in ascending order) or the string `s` sorted in ascending order. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the final state includes the processed test cases and their respective outputs.
