### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires verifying if a given array `b` can form a progressive square with the parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`.
   - A progressive square is defined such that each element \( a_{i,j} \) is calculated as \( a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l` (the array of integers).
   - It finds the minimum value `a` in the array `l`. This minimum value is assumed to be \( a_{1,1} \).
   - It constructs a new list `li` by calculating the values of the progressive square using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + h \cdot d \) for all \( k \) and \( h \) in the range `[0, n)`.
   - Both the original list `l` and the constructed list `li` are sorted.
   - If the sorted lists `l` and `li` are equal, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

3. **Verification Using Annotations:**
   - **Initial State:** Before the function call, `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \le n \le 500 \), `c` and `d` are integers such that \( 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 \), and `l` is a list of \( n^2 \) integers where each integer \( b_i \) satisfies \( 1 \le b_i \le 10^9 \).
   - **After Finding Minimum Value:** `a` is correctly identified as the minimum value in the list `l`.
   - **Constructing List `li`:** The list `li` is constructed by iterating over all possible indices \( k \) and \( h \) in the range `[0, n)` and calculating the values using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + h \cdot d \). This ensures that all elements of the progressive square are included.
   - **Sorting and Comparing Lists:** Both `l` and `li` are sorted, and the comparison ensures that the elements match in both frequency and value.
   - **Return Values:** The function returns 'yes' if the sorted lists are equal, indicating that the array `l` can form the progressive square. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The function correctly handles the constraints \( 2 \le n \le 500 \), \( 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 \), and \( 1 \le b_i \le 10^9 \).
   - The sorting step ensures that the comparison is accurate even if the elements in `l` are in random order.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It accurately checks if the given array can form a progressive square with the specified parameters. The logic and steps are sound and handle the constraints and edge cases effectively.

Final: **True**
