The code snippet initializes `nodes` as a `defaultdict` with lists as default values. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `start`, `edges`, or `empty`. However, it changes the type and structure of `nodes`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `t` is an integer input by the user, `nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing adjacent nodes, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True.**
