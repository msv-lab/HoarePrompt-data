Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
- `k` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18.
- The current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`.

Given this information, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'` to the console. There are no variables or objects being evaluated or printed; it's a straightforward print of a constant string.

Output: **NO**
