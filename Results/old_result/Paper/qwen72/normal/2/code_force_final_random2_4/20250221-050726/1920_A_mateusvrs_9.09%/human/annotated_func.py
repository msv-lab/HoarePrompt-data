#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and x is an integer where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, ensuring a finite solution. No two constraints are the same within a test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())

    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        cx = set()
        
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        
        bx = -1

            a, x = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        
        if bx >= ax:
            r.append(0)

            tmp = 0

                if i >= bx and i <= ax:

    #State: After all iterations, `t` is 0, `r` is a list containing the results of all test cases, where each result is calculated based on the conditions described in the loop. Specifically, for each test case, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, and `cx` contains all unique `x` values where `a` is 3. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, the corresponding element in `r` is 0. Otherwise, the element in `r` is the count of valid `x` values in `cx` (those between `bx` and `ax`, inclusive) subtracted from the total possible values (`ax - bx + 1`). The variables `n`, `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` are reset for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of test cases, each containing a number of constraints represented by pairs (a, x). For each test case, it calculates a result based on the constraints: it finds the maximum value of x for constraints of type 1 (bx), the minimum value of x for constraints of type 2 (ax), and a set of unique x values for constraints of type 3 (cx). If bx is greater than or equal to ax, the result for that test case is 0. Otherwise, the result is the count of valid x values in cx (those between bx and ax, inclusive) subtracted from the total possible values (ax - bx + 1). The function prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.
