Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it processes the list of numbers. Specifically, the `numbers` list is being modified while it is being sorted, which can lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the program does not handle the conversion of the input string to integers correctly before sorting. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for _ in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        numbers.sort()
        suma = 0
        for i in range(0, len(numbers), 2):
            suma += numbers[i]
        print(suma)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The input is read and converted to a list of integers using `list(map(int, input().split()))`.
2. **Sorting**: The list of numbers is sorted in ascending order.
3. **Sum Calculation**: The program iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the first number of each pair to the sum. This ensures that the minimum value of each pair is added to the score, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.

This corrected program will produce the correct output for the given problem description.
