Output State: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `lex` is an input integer between 26 and 52 (inclusive), `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex]]`, `arr` is `[26]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`, which means the new value of `lex` is now between 26 and 52 (inclusive) since the original value was between 52 and 78 (inclusive). All other variables remain unchanged.
