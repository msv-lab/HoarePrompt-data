The code snippet `[n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]` converts the strings `n` and `m` to integers.

- `n` and `m` were originally strings read from input.
- After conversion, `n` and `m` are now integers.
- The condition `min(n, m) >= 2` remains valid because the minimum of the two integers is still greater than or equal to 2.
- The variable `t` is still greater than 1.
- The variable `T` is still 1.
- The variable `ans` is still equal to the original value of `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`, where `n` and `m` are the original integer values.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers, `min(n, m) >= 2`, `t` is greater than 1, `T` is 1, `ans` is equal to the original value of `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`.**
