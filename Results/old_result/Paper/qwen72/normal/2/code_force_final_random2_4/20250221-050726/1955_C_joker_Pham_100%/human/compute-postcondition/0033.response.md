Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` and `r` are indices such that `l` is either 0 or 1, and `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the condition. `sunks` is either 0, 1, or 2. The current value of `k` is 0. If `a[l] <= a[r]` and `k` was initially greater than or equal to `2 * a[l]`, then `l` has been incremented to 1, `r` has been decremented to `n - 1` or `n - 2` if `a[r]` was initially greater than or equal to `a[l-1]`, `sunks` is set to 2, and `k` was reduced by `2 * a[l-1]`. If `k` was initially less than `2 * a[l]` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, then `sunks` is set to 1. In all other cases, `sunks` remains 0. The program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
