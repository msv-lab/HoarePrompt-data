Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is 0
- `casos` is greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer, and the current value of `n` is 1

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('##')
```

This `print` statement simply prints the string `'##'` to the console. The values of the variables `c`, `casos`, and `n` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the string `'##'` is hardcoded and does not depend on any of these variables.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **##**
