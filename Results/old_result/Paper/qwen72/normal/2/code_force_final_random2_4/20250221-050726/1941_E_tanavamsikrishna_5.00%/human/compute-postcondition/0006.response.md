The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `len(costs) - (k - 1)`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `costs` relative to `k`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1.
- The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

State: **`total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged, `rows` remains unchanged, `costs` remains unchanged, `i` is 1.**
