Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is 3, `mak` is 3, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing at least 4 values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `mak`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `mak` is now 3, while `_`, `n`, `i`, `mak2`, and `pans` retain their original values and conditions.
