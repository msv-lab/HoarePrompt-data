The function reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and a list of `n` lists (`rows`) containing `m` integers each. It then computes a list of costs using the function `func_1` for each row in `rows`. The function calculates the minimum sum of every contiguous subsequence of `k` elements in the `costs` list and prints this minimum sum. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. The input variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows` remain unchanged after the function execution.
