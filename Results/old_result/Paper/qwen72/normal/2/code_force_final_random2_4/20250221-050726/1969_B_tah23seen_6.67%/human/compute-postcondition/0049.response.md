The code swaps the characters at the indices `left` and `right` in the string `s`. Since `left` is an index where a '1' exists and `right` is an index where a '0' exists, after the swap, the character at `left` will be '0' and the character at `right` will be '1'. The other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` still contains all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `left` is an index where a '0' now exists in `s` and is less than `len(s)`, `right` is an index where a '1' now exists in `s` and is less than `len(s)`, and `left` is less than or equal to `right`.**
