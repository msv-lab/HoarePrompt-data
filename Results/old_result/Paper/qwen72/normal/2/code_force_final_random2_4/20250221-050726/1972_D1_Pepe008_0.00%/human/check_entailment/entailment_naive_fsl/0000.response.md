Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the way it calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b). Specifically, the loop and the calculation of `x` do not correctly implement the condition that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Issue:
The program incorrectly calculates the number of valid pairs by using the formula:
```python
x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
```
This formula does not correctly account for the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

### Counterexample:
Consider the test case where \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\). The correct output should be 3, corresponding to the pairs (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2). However, the program will produce an incorrect result because it does not correctly check the condition for each pair.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you would need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This corrected version iterates over all pairs (a, b) and checks the condition directly, ensuring that the program works correctly for all potential cases.
