Output State: **_ is equal to the number of test cases minus 1, `n` is the input positive integer for the last test case, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<`. The loop has completed all its iterations, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `_` will be equal to the total number of test cases minus 1, indicating that the loop has run through all the test cases. The variable `n` will hold the value of the input positive integer for the last test case. The variable `i` will be `len(pans) - 1`, reflecting the final iteration of the inner loops. The variable `mak` will store the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`. The variable `mak2` will hold the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`. The list `pans` will contain all the indices for which the user input was `=` or `<` during the execution of the loop. The output buffer has been flushed, ensuring that all outputs have been sent to the system.
