Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by the number of distinct card types (`n`), the number of coins available (`k`), and a list of initial card counts (`a`). For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of cards that can be obtained by distributing the available coins among the card types. The function reads the number of test cases (`t`) and the inputs for each test case from standard input. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it has printed the results for each test case to standard output. **
