To determine what will be printed by the `print('draw')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `n` is `r[0]`
   - `m` is `r[1]`
   - `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`
   - `x2` is `r[4] - a`
   - `y2` is `r[5]`
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`
   - The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`
   - If `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3] + 1` and `a` is `r[5] - 1`
   - If `y1` is less than `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3] - 1` and `a` is `r[1] - r[5]`
   - `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`, which is an odd number
   - `t` is `abs(r[5] - y1)`
   - Either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`

2. **Conditions to Check:**
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`
   - The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`
   - Either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`

Given these conditions, let's analyze the logic:

- **Condition Analysis:**
  - `x2` is greater than `x1` (given)
  - The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number (given)
  - `y1` is not equal to `y2` (given)
  - One of the following must be true:
    - `x2` is less than or equal to `x1` (contradicts the given condition that `x2` is greater than `x1`)
    - `x1` is less than 1
    - `x2` is greater than `n`

Since `x2` is greater than `x1`, the only remaining conditions to check are:
- `x1` is less than 1
- `x2` is greater than `n`

If either of these conditions is true, the code will execute the `print('draw')` statement.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the conditions, one of the conditions (`x1` is less than 1 or `x2` is greater than `n`) must be true for the `print('draw')` statement to execute.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **draw**
