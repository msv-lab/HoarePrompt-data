### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (func_1):**
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` in a list `cases`.
   - The input handling is consistent with the problem description, ensuring that the input is read and stored correctly.

2. **Game Logic (func_2):**
   - The function `func_2` counts the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) in the string `s`.
   - It returns `'YES'` if the number of facing-up coins is odd, and `'NO'` if it is even.
   - The key insight here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins. This is because each move changes the parity of the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, the player whose turn it is can always make a move, ensuring they can force a win. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, the player whose turn it is will eventually be unable to make a move and will lose.
   - The logic implemented in `func_2` correctly captures this insight.

3. **Correctness of the Solution:**
   - The solution correctly identifies the winning condition based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
   - The implementation is straightforward and matches the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the input and implements the game logic based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins, which is the correct approach to determine the winner.

Final: **True**
