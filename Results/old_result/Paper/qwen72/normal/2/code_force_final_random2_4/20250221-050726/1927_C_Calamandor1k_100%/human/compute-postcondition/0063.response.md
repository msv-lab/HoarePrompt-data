The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `cases`. 

- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains five elements: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.
  - `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5).
  - `k` is an even integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m)).
  - `a` and `b` are lists of integers (1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6) with lengths `n` and `m` respectively.

The function returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple in `cases`. Each 'YES' or 'NO' indicates whether the conditions checked in the loop for the corresponding tuple (n, m, k, a, b) were met. The conditions involve checking the unique elements in lists `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k`, and ensuring the total number of distinct elements (those only in `a`, only in `b`, or in both) meets certain criteria.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. For each tuple `(n, m, k, a, b)` in `cases`, it checks if the conditions involving the unique elements in lists `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and the total number of distinct elements meet certain criteria. It returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple, indicating whether the conditions were met.**
