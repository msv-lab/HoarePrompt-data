Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is an empty list, the loop has completed its execution, `x` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
        s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
        x = i
        break
else:
    s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
    x = n - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `s` is an empty list if the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is not met. If the condition is met, `s` is the string formed by concatenating the first character of the first string in `a` with the entire second string in `a`, `x` is 0, `i` is 0, the second character of the first string in `a` is '1', and the first character of the second string in `a` is '0'. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if the condition is met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `i` is 1, the second character of the first string in `a` is '1', and the first character of the second string in `a` is '0'. If the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met, `s` is the string formed by concatenating the first two characters of the first string in `a` with the entire second string in `a`, and `x` is 1. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty list and `x` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `i` is 2, the second character of the first string in `a` is '1', and the first character of the second string in `a` is '0'. If `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`, then `s` is the string formed by concatenating the first two characters of the first string in `a` with the entire second string in `a`, and `x` is 1. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty list and `x` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
