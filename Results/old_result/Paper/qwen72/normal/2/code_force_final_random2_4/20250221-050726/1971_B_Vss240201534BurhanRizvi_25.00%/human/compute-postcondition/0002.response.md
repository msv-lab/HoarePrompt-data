Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is the input string (a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters), the input is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `s2` is a shuffled version of the string `s`.** 

Explanation: The code `s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))` shuffles the characters of the string `s` and assigns the shuffled string to `s2`. The other variables (`t`, `s`, the input, and `_`) remain unchanged.
