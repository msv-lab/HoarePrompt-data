#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n - 1`, `b` contains all elements from `a` in a modified order based on the characters in `s`. If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` contains the element from `a` at index `l`, and `l` is `n`. If `s[i]` is 'R', `b` contains the element from `a` at index `r`, and `r` is `-1`. The list `b` will have exactly `n` elements, and the indices `l` and `r` will be out of bounds (specifically, `l` will be `n` and `r` will be `-1`).
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: `b` is a list with `n` elements, `v` is the first element of `b`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order, `p` is the product of all elements in `b`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list `ans` containing the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. It processes the list `a` based on the directions given in the string `s` ('L' or 'R') to create a new list `b` with elements from `a` in a modified order. It then computes the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order and returns this list. The returned list has `n` elements, each representing the product of all elements in `b` from that position to the end.
