Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `line` is the first line of the third test case, `elements` is a list of substrings from `line` split by whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `elements = line.split()` updates the variable `elements` to be a list of substrings obtained by splitting the string `line` using whitespace as the delimiter. The values of `t` and `line` remain unchanged.
