t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each element in cases is a tuple containing three integers n, m, and k, and two lists of integers a and b. For each test case, 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), and k is even. The lists a and b contain n and m integers respectively, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6. The sum of values n and m over all test cases does not exceed 4·10^5.
