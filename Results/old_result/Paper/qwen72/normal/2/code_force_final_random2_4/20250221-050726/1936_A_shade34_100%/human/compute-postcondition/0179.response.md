Postcondition: ***`_` is 1, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is 0, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `s` is the user input string. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 0, `pans` is `[0]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0]`. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.***
