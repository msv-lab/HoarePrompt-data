The function `func` does not explicitly define parameters in its signature, but based on the provided parameter constraints, it is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers. The function processes these inputs to determine some output based on the given constraints.

- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50000).
  - `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ floor(n/2)).
  - `a` is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n), where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 50000.

The exact output of the function is not specified in the problem statement, but it is implied that the function processes these inputs to produce some result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers. It returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.**
