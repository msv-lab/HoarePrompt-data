The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer (greater than 0). For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (greater than 0) - 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers extracted from `data[2:2 + n]` and converted to integers, `data` is a list of strings from the input split by whitespace, `index` is 2 + `n`, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**
