Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `m` must be at least 1, `i` is the first character of `s`, `s1` is an empty string, and the first character of `s` (`i`) is in the set `alphabet`. If the size of `alphabet` is not 1, `s2` remains an empty string, `i` is removed from `alphabet`, and the size of `alphabet` is now `k-1`. If the size of `alphabet` is exactly 1, `s2` contains the first character of `s`, and the size of `alphabet` remains 1.***
