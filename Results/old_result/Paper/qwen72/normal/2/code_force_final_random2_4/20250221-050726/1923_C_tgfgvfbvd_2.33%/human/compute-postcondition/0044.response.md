The provided code snippet reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This impacts the initial state by updating the values of `n` and `m` to the new values provided by the user. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers based on user input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all elements in `l`.**
