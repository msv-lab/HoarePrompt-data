Output State: **`one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `mini` is 100000000, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If the length of `final` is 0, `final` is updated to contain exactly one element: either `0` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or `n` otherwise. `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl` (increased by 1 if `s[i] == '0'`), `lst` is [1] (updated to [1, 2] if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50). `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n - 1`. `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `one_perc` to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
