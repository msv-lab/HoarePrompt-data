The code snippet `b = l[x]` assigns the value of the element at index `x` in the list `l` to the variable `b`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input
- `y` is less than `n - 1`
- `x` is `y + 3`
- `y + 3 < n`

We know that `x` is `y + 3`, and since `y + 3 < n`, `x` is a valid index for the list `l`. Therefore, `b` will be assigned the value of `l[y + 3]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 3`, `y + 3 < n`, `b` is `l[y + 3]`.**
