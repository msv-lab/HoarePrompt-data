t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, k is even), where n is the length of the desired permutation and k is the segment length used to check the level condition. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
