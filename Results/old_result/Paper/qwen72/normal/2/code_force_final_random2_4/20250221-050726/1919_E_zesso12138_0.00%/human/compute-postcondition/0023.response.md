The provided Python code snippet updates the list `p` by mapping the elements from `data[index:index + n]` to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (greater than 0) - 2
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`
- `p` is a list of `n` integers extracted from `data[index:index + n]` and converted to integers
- `data` is a list of strings from the input split by whitespace
- `index` is 4 + 2 * `n`
- `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` and the new `result` value
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`

The code snippet:
```python
p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
```

Impact of the code:
- The list `p` is updated to contain the integers converted from the sublist `data[index:index + n]`.

Since the initial state already specifies that `p` is a list of `n` integers extracted from `data[index:index + n]` and converted to integers, the code snippet does not change the value of `p`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (greater than 0) - 2, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers extracted from `data[index:index + n]` and converted to integers, `data` is a list of strings from the input split by whitespace, `index` is 4 + 2 * `n`, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` and the new `result` value, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`.**
