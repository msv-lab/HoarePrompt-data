Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to be the minimum of `n` and the difference between `b` and `a`.
- The values of `_`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `k` is determined by the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.
