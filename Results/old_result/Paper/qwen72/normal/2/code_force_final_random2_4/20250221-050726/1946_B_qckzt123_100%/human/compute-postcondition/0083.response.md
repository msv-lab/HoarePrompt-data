The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This operation updates the values of `n` and `k` but does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `k-2`, `k` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `t` is `(2^(k-1) * initial_t) % MOD`, `ans` is the remainder of (`initial_ans` + `sum of (2^j * initial_t) % MOD` for `j` from 1 to `k-1`) divided by `MOD`, `tmp`, `_` is 0, `T` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `s` remain unchanged.**
