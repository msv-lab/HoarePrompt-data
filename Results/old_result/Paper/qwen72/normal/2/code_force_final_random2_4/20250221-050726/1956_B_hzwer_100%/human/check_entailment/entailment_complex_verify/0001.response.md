### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a card game where each player takes turns placing cards on a table. The goal is to maximize the number of points you can score, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
   - Each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the deck, and the game involves 2n cards.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - To maximize your score, you need to count how many pairs of cards you have in your hand.
   - For each integer, if you have both cards, you can score 1 point when you place the second card on the table.
   - Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours, but this does not affect the count of pairs in your hand.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.
   - It initializes a list `cnt` to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and increments the count for each integer.
   - It calculates the total score by summing up `max(0, x - 1)` for each count `x` in `cnt`. This ensures that you only count pairs of cards (i.e., if you have 2 cards of the same integer, you can score 1 point).

4. **Optimality Consideration:**
   - The program correctly counts the pairs of cards in your hand.
   - Since Nene plays optimally, she will always try to score points whenever possible. However, the program focuses on your optimal strategy, which is to count the pairs of cards you have.
   - The logic of adding `max(0, x - 1)` for each count `x` ensures that you only count pairs, which is the correct approach to maximize your score.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where you have no pairs (i.e., all counts are 1), resulting in a score of 0.
   - It also handles the case where you have multiple pairs, correctly summing up the points.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score by counting the pairs of cards in your hand. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
