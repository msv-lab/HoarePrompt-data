#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of cards each player receives. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, representing the integers on the cards in your hand, with each integer from 1 to n appearing at most twice in the sequence. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        elements = line.split()
        
        print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))
        
    #State: `t` is the number of test cases, and the loop has processed all the lines corresponding to the test cases. Each line has been split into a list of substrings (`elements`), and for each list, the sum of the counts of each unique element divided by 3 (integer division) has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from a file where each test case consists of a list of integers representing cards. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the counts of each unique card value divided by 3 (using integer division) and prints this sum. After processing all test cases, the function has printed a result for each one, reflecting the distribution of card values in each test case.
