The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 1), `i` is 2, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=`. If the user input is `<`, `mak` is updated to 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`. Therefore, `i` becomes 3, and `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 1), `i` is 3, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=`. If the user input is `<`, `mak` is updated to 2.**
