Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `length` is 30, `i` is 1, and `s` is a list containing the string '0'.** 

The code appends the string '0' to the list `s`. The values of `x`, `t`, `nalla`, `length`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `s` now contains the string '0'.
