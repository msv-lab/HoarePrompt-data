The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing from 3 to 4. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged. The condition `gcd(x, y) == 1` is still valid because the greatest common divisor of 5 and 4 is 1. Therefore, the value of `cnt` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 40, `m` must be at least 24, `x` is 5, `y` is 4, `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and \((x + y) * x <= n\) and \((x + y) * y <= m\), plus 1.**
