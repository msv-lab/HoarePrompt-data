Postcondition: ***`required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is 0. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[(x - mod_x) % x, mod_y]`. All other variables remain unchanged.***
