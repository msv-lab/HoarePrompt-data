The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` has one additional element which is `a[r+1]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` has one additional element which is `a[r+1]`, `r` is `r - 1`.**
