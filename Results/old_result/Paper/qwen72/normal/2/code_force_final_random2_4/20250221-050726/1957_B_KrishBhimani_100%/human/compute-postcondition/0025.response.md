The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` depends on the conditions involving `temp` and `k`. If `temp` was 4 and `temp * 2` (which is 8) is less than `k`, then `i` starts as 1; otherwise, `i` starts as 0. After incrementing, `i` will be 2 if the condition was met, or 1 if it was not. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 2 if `temp` was 4 and `temp * 2` is less than `k`, otherwise `i` is 1, `temp` is 8 if `temp` was 4, otherwise `temp` is 2.**
