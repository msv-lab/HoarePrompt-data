Output State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` consisting only of characters "+" and "-", `count` is the number of "+" characters in `expression`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `count` will hold the total number of "+" characters found in the string `expression`. The length and composition of `expression` remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
