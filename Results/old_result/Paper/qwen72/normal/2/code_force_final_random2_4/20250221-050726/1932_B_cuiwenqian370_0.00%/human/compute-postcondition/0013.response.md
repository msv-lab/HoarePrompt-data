Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `n` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`, `index` is incremented by 3, `path` is `data[index-3]`, `results` now includes the result of `func_1(path)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by 1, so it is now incremented by a total of 3 from its original value.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index-1]` because `index` was previously incremented by 2, and now it is incremented by 1 more.
- `path` is `data[index-3]` because `index` has been incremented by 3 in total.
- The conditions for `t` and the inclusion of the result of `func_1(path)` in `results` remain unchanged.
