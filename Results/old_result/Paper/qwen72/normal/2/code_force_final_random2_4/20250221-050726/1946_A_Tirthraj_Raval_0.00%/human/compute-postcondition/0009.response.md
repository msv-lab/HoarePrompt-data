To determine what will be printed by the `print(res)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `_` is 0 (this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
   - `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.
   - `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the list `a`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases, but it does not affect the current print statement.
   - `n` is the length of the list `a`.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `p` is the index of the middle element in the list `a`. Since `a` is sorted, this index helps us find the median element.
   - `res` is the count of how many times the element at index `p` appears in the list `a`.

3. **Calculating `p`:**
   - `p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1`
   - This formula calculates the index of the middle element in the list `a`. For example:
     - If `n` is 5, then `p = (5 + 1) // 2 - 1 = 3 // 2 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`.
     - If `n` is 6, then `p = (6 + 1) // 2 - 1 = 7 // 2 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`.

4. **Determining `res`:**
   - `res` is the count of the element at index `p` in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` is sorted, the element at index `p` is the median element of the list.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(res)` statement will print the number of times the median element appears in the list `a`.

Given the above steps, the output will be the count of the median element in the list `a`.

Output: **res (where res is the number of times the element at index p appears in the list a, and p is the index of the median element in the sorted list a)**
