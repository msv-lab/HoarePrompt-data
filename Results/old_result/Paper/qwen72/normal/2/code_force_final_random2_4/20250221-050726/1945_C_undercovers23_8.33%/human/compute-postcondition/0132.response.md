The code snippet `final.sort()` sorts the list `final` in ascending order. The values of `mini` and `lst` remain unchanged. The list `final` now contains the same elements as before, but they are sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`.**
