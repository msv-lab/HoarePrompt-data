Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer.** 

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` now holds an integer value provided by the user. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
