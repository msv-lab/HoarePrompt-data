Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a` and `b` for each case. This aligns with the problem's input format.

2. **Initial Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the initial number of screens required for the 2x2 icons (`t`). If `b` (the number of 2x2 icons) is even, it divides `b` by 2 to get the number of screens needed. If `b` is odd, it divides `b` by 2 and adds 1 to account for the extra screen needed.
   - This calculation is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells available for 2x2 icons (since a 5x3 grid has 15 cells).

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the remaining cells available after placing the 2x2 icons (`t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`). This is correct because each screen has 15 cells, and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - It then checks if the remaining cells (`t1`) are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`a`). If so, the number of screens remains the same (`t`).

4. **Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, the program calculates the additional screens needed (`t2 = a - t1`).
   - It then adds the necessary screens to `t` based on whether `t2` is divisible by 15 (the total number of cells in a screen). If `t2` is exactly divisible by 15, it adds `t2 // 15` screens. If not, it adds `t2 // 15 + 1` screens to account for the extra screen needed for the remaining cells.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case, which is the final value of `t`.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of screens needed for the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

Correctness: **True**
