The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is 2, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `s` is the user input string. If `s` is `<`, `pans` is `[1]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[1]`. If `s` is `<` or `=`, `pans` is `[0, 1]`. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.**
