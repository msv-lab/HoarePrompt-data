Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is the input integer (unchanged), `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the final value of `h` after all iterations, `h` is the last hour value processed, and `m` is the last minute value processed.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`s`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is only used to control the number of iterations of the loop.
- **`day`**: After all iterations, `day` will be 'AM' if the last processed hour (`h`) is between 0 and 11 (inclusive), and 'PM' if the last processed hour (`h`) is 12 or between 1 and 11 (after being adjusted from 13 to 24).
- **`h`**: The final value of `h` will be the last hour value processed, adjusted according to the rules in the loop.
- **`m`**: The final value of `m` will be the last minute value processed.
