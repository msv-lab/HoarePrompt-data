Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, and `k` is 0. If `b[i]` (which is `b[1]`) is equal to `b[i - 1]` (which is `b[0]`), `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]` appended to it, and `k` is decreased by 2. If `b[i]` (which is `b[1]`) is not equal to `b[i - 1]` (which is `b[0]`), and `b[i]` (which is `b[1]`) is not equal to `b[i + 1]` (which is `b[2]`), `l` now includes the value of `b[1]`. Otherwise, `l` remains unchanged.***
