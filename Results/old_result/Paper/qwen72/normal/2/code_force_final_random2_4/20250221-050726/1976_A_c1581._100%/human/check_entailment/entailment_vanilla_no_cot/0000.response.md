Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The function `func_1` has a logical error in how it checks the conditions for the password. Specifically, the check `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is incorrect because it only checks the last digit against all letters, which does not ensure that no digit comes after a letter. Additionally, the sorting and comparison logic can be simplified and made more efficient.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    # Separate digits and letters
    digits = [char for char in password if char.isdigit()]
    letters = [char for char in password if char.isalpha()]
    
    # Check if digits and letters are sorted
    if digits != sorted(digits) or letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    # Check if any digit comes after a letter
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return False
    
    return True
```

With this corrected function, the program should correctly determine if the password meets the specified conditions.
