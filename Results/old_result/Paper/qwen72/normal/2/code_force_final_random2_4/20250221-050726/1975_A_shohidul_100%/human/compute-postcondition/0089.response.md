Postcondition: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer where 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `check_all` is `True` if the list `a` is non-decreasing from index 1 to `n-1`, otherwise `False`, `i` is 1, and the current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than the current value of `a[i]`.**
