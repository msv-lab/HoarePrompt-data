The code snippet `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum between its current value (which is 0) and the value of `i` (which is 1). Since `i` is 1 and `ans` is 0, `ans` will be updated to 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer where x >= 1, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is divisible by `i` without any remainder, and the current value of `n` is less than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `i`.**
