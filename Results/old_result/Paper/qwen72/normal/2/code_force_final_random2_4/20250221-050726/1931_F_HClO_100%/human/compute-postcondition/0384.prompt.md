Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5), where n is the number of chat participants and k is the number of participants who posted screenshots. Each of the k lines contains n integers a_{ij} (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n, all a_{ij} are distinct), representing the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0}, who is the author of the screenshot. All authors of the screenshots are different.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if m == 1:
        input()
        print('yes')
        continue
    a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())
    a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())
    l11 = [i for i in l1 if i != a2]
    l22 = [i for i in l2 if i != a1]
    if l11 != l22:
        for _ in range(m - 2):
            input()
        print('no')
        continue
    idx1 = idx2 = -1
    p1 = p2 = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
            break
        if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
                idx1 = idx2 = i
                break
            else:
                if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                    idx1 = i
                    p1 = 1
                else:
                    idx2 = i
                    p2 = 1
                if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                    break
    val = []
    if idx1 == -1 and idx2 != -1:
        idx1 = n - 2
    if idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1:
        idx2 = n - 2
    if idx1 < idx2:
        l2.insert(idx1, a2)
        l = l2
    elif idx1 > idx2:
        l1.insert(idx2, a1)
        l = l1
    else:
        if m == 2:
            print('yes')
            continue
        a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
        if l3.index(a1) < l3.index(a2):
            l1.insert(idx2, a1)
            l = l1
        else:
            l2.insert(idx1, a2)
            l = l2
        val.append((a3, l3))
        m -= 1
    for _ in range(m - 2):
        a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
        val.append((a3, l3))
    for a3, l3 in val:
        if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
            print('no')
            break
    else:
        print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is `m-3`, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` will be set by the last tuple in `val`, and `val` is a list containing at least `m-2` tuples. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]` for any tuple in `val`, the program prints 'no' and exits the loop. If all tuples in `val` satisfy the condition, the program prints 'yes'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has completed all iterations without breaking, meaning for every tuple `(a3, l3)` in `val`, `l3` was equal to `[i for i in l if i != a3]`. The final state is that `m` is greater than 2, `val` contains `m-2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, and the program prints 'yes'. All other variables (`_`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`) retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` is greater than 2, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)`, `n` is greater than 1, `a1` is the first integer from the user input, `a2` is the first integer from the new user input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the user input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new user input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the conditions encountered during the loop, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`. The loop has iterated through all tuples in `val`, and for each tuple `(a3, l3)`, `l3` was equal to the list of elements from `l` excluding `a3`. The loop completes without breaking, and the final output is 'yes'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
