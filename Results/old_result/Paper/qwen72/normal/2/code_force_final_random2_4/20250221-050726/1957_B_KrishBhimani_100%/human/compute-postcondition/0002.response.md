The code snippet `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` converts each element of the list `l1` into integers and assigns the first element to `n` and the second element to `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input

After executing the code:
- `n` is assigned the integer value of the first element of `l1`
- `k` is assigned the integer value of the second element of `l1`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`**
