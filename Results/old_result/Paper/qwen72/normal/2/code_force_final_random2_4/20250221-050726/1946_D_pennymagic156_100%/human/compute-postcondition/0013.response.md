To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head: `val` and `a`.

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements of the list `a`.
- For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element.

### Given State:
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\).

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes, `a` must have at least one element. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0, and `a` must be a non-empty list.

### Final State:
- `a` must be a list of `n` non-negative integers, where `n` is greater than 0.
- `val` will be the first element of `a` when the loop starts.

### State:
**`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `val` is the first element of `a`**
