You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())

    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()

    return cases

#Function 2:
def func_2(case):

    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

cases = func_1()
for case in cases:
    print(func_2(case))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and each (n, s) in cases is a tuple where n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and s is a string of length n containing only 'U' and 'D'.
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        
        cases.append((n, s))
        
    #State: `t` is an integer read from input, 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, each tuple is `(n, s)`, where `n` is an integer read from the corresponding line of input, and `s` is a string read from the corresponding line of input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. `_` is `t-1`.
    return cases
    #The program returns a list named `cases` containing `t` tuples, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100. Each tuple in the list is of the form `(n, s)`, where `n` is an integer read from the corresponding line of input, and `s` is a string read from the corresponding line of input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from the standard input. It first reads an integer `t` (where 1 <= t <= 100), indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only the characters 'U' and 'D'. The function returns a list named `cases` containing `t` tuples, where each tuple is of the form `(n, s)`. The string `s` is stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: case is a list where case[0] is an integer representing the number of coins (1 ≤ case[0] ≤ 100), and case[1] is a string of length case[0] containing only 'U' and 'D', representing the state of each coin (up or down).
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum(1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U')
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'
    #The program returns 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the string case[1] is even, otherwise it returns 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a list `case` as input, where `case[0]` is an integer representing the number of coins, and `case[1]` is a string of the same length containing only 'U' and 'D'. The function returns 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the string `case[1]` is even, and 'NO' if the number of 'U' characters is odd. The state of the input `case` remains unchanged after the function call.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (func_1):**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` in a list `cases`.
   - This part of the code correctly handles the input format as specified in the problem description.

2. **Game Logic (func_2):**
   - The function counts the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) in the string `s`.
   - It returns `'YES'` if the number of facing-up coins is odd, and `'NO'` if it is even.
   - The key insight here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins. This is because each move changes the parity of the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, the player whose turn it is can always make a move, ensuring they can force a win. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, the player whose turn it is will eventually be unable to make a move and will lose.

3. **Correctness of the Solution:**
   - The solution correctly identifies the winning condition based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
   - The implementation is straightforward and matches the problem's requirements.

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above.
