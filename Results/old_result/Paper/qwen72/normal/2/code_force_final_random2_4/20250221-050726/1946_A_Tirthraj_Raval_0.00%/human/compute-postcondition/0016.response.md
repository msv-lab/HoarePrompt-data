Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `_` is 1 (this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
- `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.
- `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the list `a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(res)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Values**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.

2. **Calculation of `p`**:
   - `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.
   - This formula is used to find the index of the middle element in the list `a` if `n` is odd, or the index of the first middle element if `n` is even.

3. **Calculation of `res`**:
   - `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` is sorted, the element at index `p` can be found and counted efficiently.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`, which is the count of the element at index `p` in the list `a`.

### Final Output:
The code prints the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the list `a`, where `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.

Output: **res (where res is the number of times the element at index p appears in the list a, and p is calculated as (n + 1) // 2 - 1)**
