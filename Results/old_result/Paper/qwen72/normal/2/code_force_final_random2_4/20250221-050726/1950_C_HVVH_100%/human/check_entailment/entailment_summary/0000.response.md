Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. It handles edge cases such as midnight (00:00) and noon (12:00) appropriately. The logic for determining whether the time is AM or PM is also correct. The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually, converting the hour part of the time and appending the appropriate AM/PM indicator. The formatting of the output also matches the required format, including leading zeros for hours and minutes.

However, there is a minor issue in the code where the variable `day` is reset to 'AM' at the beginning of each loop iteration. This is unnecessary because the correct AM/PM value is determined within the loop. Despite this, the program still produces the correct output for all test cases.

Given that the program meets the requirements and produces the expected output, the correctness can be evaluated as true.

Correctness: **True**
