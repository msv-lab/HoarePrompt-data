The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` being less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `m` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 1, and `m` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, `sum_f` is `f`, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `f` are integers provided by the user.**
