The code snippet provided updates the value of `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. Let's evaluate the impact of this code on the program:

- `n` and `m` remain positive integers within the specified range.
- `T` remains greater than 1.
- `t` remains 2.
- `info` remains a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input.
- `a` remains the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` remains the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 3.
- `i` remains 3.

The calculation for `x` is:
\[ x = \left( a - i \times (i - 1) \right) // i^2 + 1 \]

Substituting `i = 3`:
\[ x = \left( a - 3 \times (3 - 1) \right) // 3^2 + 1 \]
\[ x = \left( a - 3 \times 2 \right) // 9 + 1 \]
\[ x = \left( a - 6 \right) // 9 + 1 \]

Therefore, the new value of `x` is:
\[ x = \left( a - 6 \right) // 9 + 1 \]

Since the code snippet does not modify `suma`, it remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `x` is \(\left( a - 6 \right) // 9 + 1\).**
