Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Stalls**: The function `func_1` only considers setting up 2 stalls, which is not always sufficient to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The problem allows for up to 60 stalls, and the solution should explore more than just 2 stalls if necessary.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Cost Calculation**: The logic for calculating the costs of the stalls is flawed. The current approach sets the first cost to `n - k + 1` and the second cost to `1`, which does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. The calculation of `curr` and updating `n` and `h` is also incorrect and does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Output Format**: The output format is incorrect. If the solution is "YES", it should print the number of stalls and the prices for each stall. The current code prints "YES" and the costs incorrectly.

4. **Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, when `n` is very large and `k` is small, the solution might not find a valid configuration of stalls.

A correct solution would need to consider a more dynamic approach to set up the stalls and their prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        continue
    
    # We can always set up k stalls with prices 1, 1, ..., 1 (k times)
    # and one additional stall with price n - k + 1
    print('YES')
    if k == 1:
        print(1)
        print(n)
    else:
        print(k)
        print(' '.join(['1'] * (k - 1) + [str(n - k + 1)]))
```

This solution ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up `k` stalls with the first `k-1` stalls priced at 1 coin each and the last stall priced at `n - k + 1` coins. This guarantees that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels, and the number of stalls used is always valid (at most 60).
