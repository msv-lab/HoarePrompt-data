Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the `beautiful_count` for the corresponding test case. The `freq` dictionary for each test case will contain the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered in the array `a` of that test case. The `beautiful_count` for each test case represents the total count of numbers in `a` that can be paired with another number in `a` such that their sum is divisible by `x` and has a remainder of `mod_y` when divided by `y`. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y`) remain unchanged as they were before the loop started.**
