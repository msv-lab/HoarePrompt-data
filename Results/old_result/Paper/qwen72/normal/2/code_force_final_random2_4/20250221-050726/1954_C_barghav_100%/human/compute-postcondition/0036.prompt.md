Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= x < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `y` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= y < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of characters from the input string, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `f` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if f == 0:
        if a[i] < b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
            f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            f = 1
    elif a[i] > b[i]:
        a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= x < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `y` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= y < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `f` is 0, `i` is 0. If `f` is 0, then if `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, `f` is set to 1; otherwise, `f` remains 0 and `a[i]` is greater than or equal to `b[i]`. If `f` is not 0, then the first character of `a` is greater than the first character of `b` if `a[0]` is greater than `b[0]`; otherwise, the first character of `a` is less than or equal to the first character of `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= x < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `y` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= y < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are lists of characters from the input strings, `f` is 0, and `i` is 1. If `f` is 0 and `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, `a` and `b` swap their second elements, `f` is set to 1, and `i` remains 1. If `f` is 0 and `a[i]` is greater than or equal to `b[i]`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `f` is set to 1 if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, otherwise `f` remains 0, and `i` remains 1. If `f` is not 0, the first character of `a` is greater than the first character of `b` if `a[0]` is greater than `b[0]`; otherwise, the first character of `a` is less than or equal to the first character of `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= x < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `y` is a string representing an integer where 1 <= y < 10^100 and consists only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are lists of characters from the input strings, and `i` is 2. If `f` was initially 0, then: if `a[2]` < `b[2]`, `f` is 1, and `a[2]` and `b[2]` are swapped; if `a[2]` >= `b[2]`, `f` is 1 if `a[2]` > `b[2]`, otherwise `f` remains 0. If `f` was initially not 0, then: if `a[2]` > `b[2]`, `a[2]` and `b[2]` are swapped, and `f` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
