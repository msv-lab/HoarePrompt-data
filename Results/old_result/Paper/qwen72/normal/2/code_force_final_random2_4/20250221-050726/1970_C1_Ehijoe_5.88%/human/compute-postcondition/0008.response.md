Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque containing `[u, v]`, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `empty = False` does not change the value of `empty` because it was already `False` in the initial state. Therefore, all other variables remain unchanged, and the output state is identical to the initial state.
