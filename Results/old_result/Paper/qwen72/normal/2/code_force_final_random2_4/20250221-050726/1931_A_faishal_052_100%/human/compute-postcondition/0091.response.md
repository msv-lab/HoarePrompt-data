Output State: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `lex` is an input integer and its current value is less than 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex]]`, `arr` is `[1]`.** 

The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer `1` to the list `arr`, which was initially empty. All other variables remain unchanged.
