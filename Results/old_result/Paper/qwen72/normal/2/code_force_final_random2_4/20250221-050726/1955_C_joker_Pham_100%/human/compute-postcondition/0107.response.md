Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` depending on the initial condition, `k` is now `k - (a[l] * 2)`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is updated to `n - 2`, `n - 3`, or `n - 4` depending on the initial value of `r`. If `l` equals `r`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
