The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`.**
