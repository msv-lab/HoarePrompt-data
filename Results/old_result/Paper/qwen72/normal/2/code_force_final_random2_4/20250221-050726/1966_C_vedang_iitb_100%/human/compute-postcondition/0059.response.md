Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least three elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `sz` is the third element of `a`, and `mexsize` is 2 or 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mexsize` is incremented by 1.
- If `sz` was equal to `mexsize` initially, `mexsize` was 2, and now it is 3.
- If `sz` was not equal to `mexsize` initially, `mexsize` was 1, and now it is 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, `sz`) remain unchanged.
