Reasoning:

The provided problem statement describes a scenario where we need to calculate the year when the nth sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. However, the provided Python code does not match the problem description at all. Here's a breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is designed to process a string `path` that contains characters `@` and `*`.
   - It uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of `@` characters that can be collected while avoiding `*` characters.
   - This function is completely unrelated to the problem of calculating the year when the nth sign of the apocalypse will occur.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads input from standard input and processes it.
   - It calls `func_1` with a string `path`, which is supposed to represent the periodicity of signs, but this is incorrect because the input should be a list of integers representing the periodicity of each sign.
   - The function is also structured to handle multiple test cases, but it processes the input incorrectly and does not perform the required calculations.

Given the mismatch between the problem statement and the provided code, the code is clearly incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
