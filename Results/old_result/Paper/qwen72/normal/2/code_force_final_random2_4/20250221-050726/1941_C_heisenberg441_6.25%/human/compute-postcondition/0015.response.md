The code snippet modifies the string `s` by removing the first occurrence of the substring 'pie' and replacing it with just 'p'. This means that the character 'i' is removed from the first occurrence of 'pie' in the string.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and no longer contains the substring 'pie' at its first occurrence, `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from `s`.**
