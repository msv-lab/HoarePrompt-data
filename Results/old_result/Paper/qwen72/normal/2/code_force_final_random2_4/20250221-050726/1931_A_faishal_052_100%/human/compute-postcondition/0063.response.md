The code snippet `arr.append(1)` adds the value `1` to the list `arr`. Based on the initial conditions, the value of `arr` before executing this code depends on the value of `lex`:

- If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is initially `[1]`.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is initially `[26]`.
- If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is initially `[26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is initially an empty list.

After appending `1` to `arr`, the new value of `arr` will be:

- If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` becomes `[1, 1]`.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` becomes `[26, 1]`.
- If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` becomes `[26, 1]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` becomes `[1]`.

The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `info` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `arr` is updated to `[1, 1]` if `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is updated to `[26, 1]` if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive) or between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is updated to `[1]` if `lex` is greater than 78, and `info` is as previously defined based on the value of `lex`.**
