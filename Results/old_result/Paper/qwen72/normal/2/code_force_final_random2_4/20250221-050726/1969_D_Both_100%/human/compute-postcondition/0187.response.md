Output State: **`k` is 0, `_` is -1, `combined` is now three elements shorter than before and must still contain at least one element, `heap` contains all the elements that were originally in `combined` except the last three, sorted according to the second element of each tuple, `item` is the new last element that was removed from `combined`, `current_profit` is adjusted as follows: if the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]` twice; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]` twice. If `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is further decreased by `removed_item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. `test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged, `removed_item` is the item that was removed from `heap` and replaced by the new `item` (if `removed_item` is not None).**

Explanation:
- The line `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` pushes `item` into the heap and pops the smallest element from the heap, which is assigned to `removed_item`.
- The heap remains sorted according to the second element of each tuple.
- The value of `removed_item` is now the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was added.
- The rest of the variables (`k`, `_`, `combined`, `test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses`) remain unchanged.
- The adjustments to `current_profit` based on the conditions involving `item` and `removed_item` are still valid and should be applied as described in the initial state.
