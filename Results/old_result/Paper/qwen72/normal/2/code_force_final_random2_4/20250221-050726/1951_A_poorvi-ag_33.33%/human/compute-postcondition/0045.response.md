The function `func` does not explicitly list any parameters in its definition, but based on the provided context, it implicitly processes a range of folder names from `start` to `end`, where both `start` and `end` are integers and `start <= end`. These folders are expected to exist in the current working directory and are named with digits within the specified range. Each of these folders may contain `.html` files.

The function's primary task is to process these folders and their contents, but the specific output or return value is not clearly defined in the given context. However, a reasonable assumption would be that the function processes the `.html` files within the specified range of folders.

Functionality: **The function processes a range of folders named with digits from `start` to `end` (inclusive) in the current working directory, where `start` and `end` are integers and `start <= end`. Each folder may contain `.html` files, which are processed by the function.**
