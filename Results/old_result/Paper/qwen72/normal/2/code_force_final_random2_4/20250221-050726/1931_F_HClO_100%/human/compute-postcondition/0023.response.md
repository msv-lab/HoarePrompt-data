Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1.**

Explanation: The code initializes `idx1` and `idx2` to -1. No other variables are affected, so their values remain unchanged. The initial state is preserved except for the addition of the new variables `idx1` and `idx2` with their respective values.
