Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an input integer greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `num` is 0. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the second integer from the input, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing the second integer from the input, and `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, if `x` is not 1 or 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is a list containing the second integer from the input.***
