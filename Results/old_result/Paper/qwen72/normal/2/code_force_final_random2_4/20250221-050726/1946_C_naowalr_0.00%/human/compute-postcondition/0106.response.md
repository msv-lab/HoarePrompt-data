Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` remains `new_n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj` is a list of lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` in the input, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` in the input. The variables `t`, `z`, `leftover`, `numCuts`, `x`, and the condition `R - L <= 1` remain unchanged. `L` is now 1.**
