Postcondition: ***`s` is a new input binary string with a length of 2 to 500 characters, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `count` is 1, and `flag` is False. If the first character of `s` is different from the second character of `s`, `count` is updated to 2. Additionally, if `s[0]` is '0' and `s[1]` is '1', `j` is updated to 1 and `flag` is set to True.***
