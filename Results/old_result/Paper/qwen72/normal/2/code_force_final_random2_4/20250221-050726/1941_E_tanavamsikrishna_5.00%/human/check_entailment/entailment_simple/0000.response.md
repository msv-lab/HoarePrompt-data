Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. It also reads the dimensions of the grid, the number of bridges to build, and the maximum distance between supports, followed by the grid itself.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for calculating the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - It increments the cost of the first `d-1` elements by 1, ensuring that the first support is installed at the beginning of the row.
   - For the remaining elements, it calculates the minimum cost by considering the minimum of the previous `d` elements (excluding the current one) and adding the cost of the current cell plus 1.
   - The function returns the cost of the last element, which represents the total cost of installing supports for the entire row.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes each test case by reading the grid and calling `func_1` for each row to get the cost of building a bridge on that row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows and storing these sums in `total_costs`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum value from `total_costs`, which represents the minimum total cost of building `k` bridges.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is 1 (building only one bridge) and when `k` is equal to `n` (building bridges on all rows).
   - The constraints ensure that the input is valid, and the program correctly processes all valid inputs.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program efficiently calculates the minimum cost using dynamic programming principles within `func_1` and sliding window techniques within `func_2`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
