To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `n` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000.
   - `p` is still a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n.
   - `dp` is now a list of length 2 * n + 1 where each element `dp[j]` represents the cumulative sum of the number of ways to reach position `j - n` from any position `k` in the previous `dp` using steps of +1 or -1, modulo MOD.
   - `offset` is still equal to `n`.
   - `i` is still 2.
   - `new_dp` is no longer relevant as it has been assigned to `dp`.

3. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is still a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is now a list of length 2 * n + 1 where each element `dp[j]` represents the cumulative sum of the number of ways to reach position `j - n` from any position `k` in the previous `dp` using steps of +1 or -1, modulo MOD, `offset` is still equal to `n`, `i` is 3, and `new_dp` is no longer relevant as it has been assigned to `dp`.**
