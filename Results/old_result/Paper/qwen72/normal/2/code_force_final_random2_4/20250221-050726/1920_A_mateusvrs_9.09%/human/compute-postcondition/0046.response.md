The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `cx`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `cx`. For the loop to execute again, `cx` must contain at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the next element in `cx`, and `cx` must contain at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will now be the next element in `cx`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now the next (subsequent) element in `cx`, and `cx` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next (subsequent) element in `cx`, `bx` is less than `ax`. If the new `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.**
