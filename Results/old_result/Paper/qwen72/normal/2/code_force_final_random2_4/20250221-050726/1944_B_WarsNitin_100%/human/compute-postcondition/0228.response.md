Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, the current value of `b[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]` which is equal to the value of `b[0]`, and `ans1` now includes the value of `b[1]` appended to it, `k` is decreased by 2.**
