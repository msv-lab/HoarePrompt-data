The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving two binary strings of equal length. Here's the breakdown:

- **Parameters**: The function implicitly handles multiple test cases. Each test case involves:
  - An integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), indicating the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5) representing the length of the binary strings.
  - Two binary strings `a_{11}a_{12}...a_{1n}` and `a_{21}a_{22}...a_{2n}` of length `n`, where each character is either '0' or '1'.
- **Output**: The function processes each test case and returns a result for each. The exact nature of the result is not specified in the given information, but it likely involves some comparison or operation on the binary strings.

Given the constraints and the structure, the function's primary role is to process each test case and produce a corresponding output for each one.

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. It processes each test case and returns a result for each test case.**
