The only objects in the loop head are the variable `result` and the list `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `results`. If `results` has more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, and `results` contains at least one element ('YES' or 'NO'). For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must contain at least two elements.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `results` contains at least two elements ('YES' or 'NO'), `result` is the second element in `results`**
