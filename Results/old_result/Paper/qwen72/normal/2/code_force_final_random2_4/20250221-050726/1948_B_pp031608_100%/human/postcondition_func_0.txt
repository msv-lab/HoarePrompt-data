The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the list can be made non-decreasing by modifying at most one element according to specific rules. If the list can be made non-decreasing, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function processes up to 1000 test cases, with each list having between 2 and 50 elements. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.
