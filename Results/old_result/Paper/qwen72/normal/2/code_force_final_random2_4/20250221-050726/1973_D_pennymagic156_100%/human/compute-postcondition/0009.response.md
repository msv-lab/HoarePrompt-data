The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `0`. The loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, making it `n-1`, and it must still be greater than `0`.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`, and `i` is `n-1`. If `v` equals `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
