To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - `cnt`: This variable must be non-zero for the loop to continue.
   - `l`: This variable must be less than `n + 1` for the loop to continue.

2. **Current State:**
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \).
   - `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `cnt` is `k - 2`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be non-zero.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

Given the current state:
- `cnt` is `k - 2`. Since `k` is a positive integer and \( 1 \leq k \leq n \), `cnt` can be zero if `k` is 2. Therefore, `k` must be greater than 2 for `cnt` to be non-zero.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`. To ensure `l < n + 1`, `func_2()` must return a value such that `func_2() + 1 < n + 1`, which simplifies to `func_2() < n`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the following conditions must hold:
- `cnt` must be non-zero, which means `k` must be greater than 2.
- `l` must be less than `n + 1`, which means `func_2()` must return a value less than `n`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \) and `k > 2`, `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 1, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `func_2() < n**
