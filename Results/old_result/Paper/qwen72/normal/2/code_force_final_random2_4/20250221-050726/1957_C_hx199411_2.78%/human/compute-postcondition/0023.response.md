Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, now `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 × 10^5; `k` is an input integer where 0 < `k` ≤ `n`; `i` is `k - 1`; `c` and `r` are the last pair of integers read from the input. `num` is the sum of 1 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are equal, and 2 for each pair of `c` and `r` that are not equal, over all `k` iterations. `m` is `n - num`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is calculated as `n - num`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, `r`, and `num`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The specific value of `m` depends on the values of `n` and `num`, which are derived from the input and the conditions described in the initial state.
