To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `b`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the range `range(1, b + 1)` is non-empty.
   - For `range(1, b + 1)` to be non-empty, `b` must be at least 1 (i.e., `b >= 1`).

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `b` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 1.

4. **Review the Given State:**
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
   - `T` is greater than 0.
   - `t` is 1.
   - `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input.
   - `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
   - `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to its initial value.
   - `i` is `b`.
   - `suma` is 0.

5. **Adjust the State for Loop Execution:**
   - Since `b` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `b` is at least 1.
   - The variable `i` will be initialized by the loop, so we don't need to adjust it explicitly.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
- `T` is greater than 0.
- `t` is 1.
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input.
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1.
- `i` is `b` (but will be reset to 1 by the loop).
- `suma` is 0.

### Formatted Answer:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, `suma` is 0**
