To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`.
- `t` must be greater than 0 (but one less than before).
- `_` is a placeholder (no specific state).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is a new input string.
- `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new value of `s`.
- If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the condition is met.
- Otherwise, `cnt1` is either less than or equal to 2, or `cnt1` is odd.
- If '11' is in the new value of `s`, the string `s` contains the substring '11'.
- Otherwise, the substring '11' is not present in `s`.

### Analysis:
- The `print('YES')` statement is unconditional. It does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
- Therefore, regardless of the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, or `cnt1`, the `print` statement will always execute and print 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will always print 'YES' because it is not conditional on any of the variables or conditions provided in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
