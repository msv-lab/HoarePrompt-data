The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. This operation does not affect the values of `ii`, `n`, or `k`. The list `a` is now sorted, but its exact values depend on the user input.

Output State: **`ii` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input.**
