The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters within its definition. However, based on the context provided, it seems that the function is expected to handle multiple test cases (denoted by `t`), where for each test case, it receives three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (each ranging from 0 to 9). The function's behavior and return value are not specified in the given information, but typically, such a function would process these inputs and return some result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Since the specific output or return value is not provided, I will describe the general functionality based on the parameters:

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9). The function is expected to handle up to 1000 test cases (1 <= t <= 1000) and return a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case.**
