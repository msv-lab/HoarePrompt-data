Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `i` is 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque. If `u` equals the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains the original elements plus `v` appended to the right side. Otherwise, the conditions related to `tree` and `u`, `v` remain unchanged.***
