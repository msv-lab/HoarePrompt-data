Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 1, `h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `xa` is an input integer, `ya` is an input integer, `xb` is an input integer, `yb` is an input integer, `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) // 2)`, `l` is `max(1, ya - x)`, `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is calculated as `min(w, yb + x)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `x`, `l`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
