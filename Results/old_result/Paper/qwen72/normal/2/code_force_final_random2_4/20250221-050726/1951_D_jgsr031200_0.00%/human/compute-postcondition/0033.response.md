Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes two positive integers `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18) and performs the following actions based on their values: If `n` equals `k`, it prints "YES" followed by two "1"s. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO". If `n` is greater than `k`, it calculates a series of values and prints either "NO" or "2", "YES", and the values `-k + 1` and `1`. In all cases, the function does not return any value. **
