Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It processes multiple test cases, each with a position `n` and a number `x`, and calculates the number of different `k` values that fit the given constraints. The logic involves determining the possible `k` values by analyzing the relationship between `n`, `x`, and the pattern of the sequence. The use of the function `func_1` to find divisors and the main loop to process each test case seem to align with the problem requirements. The program also handles edge cases, such as when `y` (which is `n + x`) is odd, by printing `0` since no valid `k` can exist in such cases. Overall, the program seems to be a correct implementation for the given problem.
