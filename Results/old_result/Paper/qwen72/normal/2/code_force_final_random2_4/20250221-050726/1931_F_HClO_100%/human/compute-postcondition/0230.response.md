Output State: **`a3` is assigned the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`, if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at position `idx2`, and `l` is now a reference to `l1`, if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`, `a2` is inserted into `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`, and `l` is now equal to `l2`, if `m` was 2, `i` is `n-2`, and the conditions involving `idx1`, `idx2`, and `p2` are as described in the initial state, if `m` was not 2, all variables retain their initial values, `m` is now `m - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is decremented by 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as they are not affected by the decrement operation on `m`.
