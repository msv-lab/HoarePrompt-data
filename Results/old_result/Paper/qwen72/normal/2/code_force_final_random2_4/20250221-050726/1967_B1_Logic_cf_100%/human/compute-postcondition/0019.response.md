The only variables in the loop head are `b`, `n`, and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `b` relative to `min(n, m)`. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 2, and `min(n, m)` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `min(n, m)` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers, `min(n, m) >= 3`, `t` is greater than 1, `T` is 1, `ans` is `n + (n + 2) // 4`, `b` is 3**
