Postcondition: ***`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `w` is the square root of `q`, and `i` is 1. If `q` is divisible by `i` (which is always true since `i` is 1), and if `q // i` (which is `q` itself) is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` is updated to `[1, q]` if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` (which is always true since `i` is 1), otherwise `M` is updated to `[q]`. If `q // i` is less than `x - 1`, `M` remains an empty list.***
