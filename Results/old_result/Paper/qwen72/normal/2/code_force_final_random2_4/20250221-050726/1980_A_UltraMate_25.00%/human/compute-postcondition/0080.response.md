Postcondition: ***`t` is `t - 2`, `n` and `m` are the new input integers, `s` is the new input string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each character in the new input string `s` and must have at least one key, `ans` is the sum of `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not in `hmp`. If `hmp[i] < m`, `ans` is incremented by `m - hmp[i]` for the current character `i` in `hmp`.***
