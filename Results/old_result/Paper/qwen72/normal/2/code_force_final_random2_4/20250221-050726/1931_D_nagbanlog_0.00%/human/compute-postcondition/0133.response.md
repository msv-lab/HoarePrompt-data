Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `freq` contains the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered in the array `a`. The `beautiful_count` is the total count of numbers in `a` that can be paired with another number in `a` such that their sum is divisible by `x` and has a remainder of `mod_y` when divided by `y`. The `results` list now includes the `beautiful_count` as its last element. The variables `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `case`, `a`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` remain unchanged.**
