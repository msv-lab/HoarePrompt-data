To determine what will be printed by the `print(num)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
   - `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `loop` is greater than 1.
   - `iterable` is 2.
   - `innerLoop` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`.
   - `x` is the last integer from the input.
   - `a` is the last integer from the input.
   - `big` contains all `a` values where `x` was 1.
   - `less` contains all `a` values where `x` was 2.
   - `no` contains elements that were not 1 or 2.
   - `num` is calculated as `min(less) - max(big) - k`, where `k` is the number of elements in `no` that satisfy the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`.
   - If `num` is less than 1, the loop skips the current iteration.

2. **Understanding the Calculation of `num`:**
   - `min(less)` is the minimum value in the list `less`.
   - `max(big)` is the maximum value in the list `big`.
   - `k` is the count of elements in `no` that are between `min(less)` and `max(big)` (inclusive).

3. **Conditions for `num` to be Printed:**
   - The loop will only print `num` if `num` is greater than or equal to 1.

4. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact values of `big`, `less`, and `no` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `num`.
   - However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `num` if it meets the condition `num >= 1`.

Output: **num (where num is the value of min(less) - max(big) - k, and k is the number of elements in no that satisfy the condition i <= min(less) and i >= max(big), and num is greater than or equal to 1)**
