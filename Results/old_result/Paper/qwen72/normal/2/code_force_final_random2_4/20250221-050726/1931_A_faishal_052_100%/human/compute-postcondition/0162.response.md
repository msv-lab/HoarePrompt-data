The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads input from standard input (stdin). The input consists of multiple lines. The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), which represents the number of test cases. Each of the following `t` lines contains an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78), representing an encoded word.

The function processes each test case and returns the decoded word for each `n`.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` from stdin, representing the number of test cases. For each of the next `t` lines, it reads an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) and returns the decoded word corresponding to each `n`.**
