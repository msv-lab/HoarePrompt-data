Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the new input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`, `_` is incremented by 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list. The loop will continue to execute as long as `temp * 2` is less than `k`. After the loop finishes, `i` will be the largest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`, and `temp` will be \(2^i\).**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will hold the highest power of 2 that is still less than `k`, and `temp` will hold the value of \(2^i\). All other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `_`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`) will remain unchanged from their initial states.
