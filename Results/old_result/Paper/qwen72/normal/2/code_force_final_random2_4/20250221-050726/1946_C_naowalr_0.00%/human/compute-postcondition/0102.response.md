Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements, `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements (with `a` added as an additional element)**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the new integers read from the input. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `adj[a]`, and `adj[b]`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions.
