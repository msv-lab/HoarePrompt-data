The function `func_1` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet. However, based on the parameter constraints given, we can infer that the function likely accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. 

- `t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` and `b` are integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n.

Since the output is not specified, we cannot determine the exact return value. However, we can describe the expected functionality based on the typical behavior of functions with such parameters.

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It processes these parameters according to some logic (not specified) and returns a result based on the input values. The exact nature of the return value is not provided, but it is likely related to the constraints and relationships between the input parameters.**
