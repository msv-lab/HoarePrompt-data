Postcondition: ***`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, and `i` is 29. If `u` (the bit at position 29 in `x`) is 0, `a` is a list containing the XOR of all elements in the original `a` that contributed to making `op` 0 at some point during the loop, `val` is the last element of the original `a`, `op` is the XOR of the bits at position 29 of all elements in the original `a`, and `ai` is the XOR of all elements in the original `a` if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` is 0. If `u` is 1, and `v` (the sum of the bits at position 29 in each element of `a`) is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop, and `ans` remains -1. If `v` is even, `ans` is updated to the maximum of the previous value of `ans` (-1) and `cnt`, where `cnt` is the number of elements in `a` whose 30th bit contributes to making `op` (the XOR of the 30th bits of all elements in `a`) equal to 0.***
