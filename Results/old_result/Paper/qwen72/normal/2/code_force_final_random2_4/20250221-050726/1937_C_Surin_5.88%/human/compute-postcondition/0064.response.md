The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 2, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`, `v2` is 1, and `r` is the user input. If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is set to 1. Otherwise, the values of `v1`, `v2`, `i`, `prev`, `kp`, `n`, and `g` remain unchanged.**
