Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and they are assigned the values from the input split by space. `s` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'.** 

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `s` to the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are assigned from the input. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `s` and the unchanged conditions for `n` and `k`.
