Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `cases` will have its original value (as it is not modified within the loop), `i` will be equal to `cases` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), `j` will be 2 (the last value it reaches in the inner loop), `lex` will be the last input integer processed (unchanged from its final modification), and `info` will contain a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, structured as follows: For each input `lex`, if `lex` is less than 28, the list will be `[1, 1, 1, lex - 3]`; if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), the list will be `[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]`; if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), the list will be `[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]`. Each list in `info` is sorted in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cases):
    temp = ''
    for j in range(3):
        temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
    print(temp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `lex` is the last input integer processed, `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, `temp` is the string formed by converting the integers `info[0][0]`, `info[0][1]`, and `info[0][2]` to their corresponding lowercase letters.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `lex` is the last input integer processed, `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, `temp` is now a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[1][1] + 96`, and `info[1][2] + 96`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cases` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `lex` is the last input integer processed, `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, `temp` is the string formed by concatenating the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[2][0] + 96`, `info[2][1] + 96`, and `info[2][2] + 96`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
