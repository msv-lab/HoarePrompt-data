Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 200000, `t` is 1, `i` is 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `empty` is False, `tree` is a deque containing `u` followed by its previous elements.** 

Explanation: The code `tree.appendleft(u)` adds the integer `u` to the left side of the deque `tree`. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `i`, `v`, and `empty`) remain unchanged. The condition `empty` is still False, and the deque `tree` now starts with `u` followed by its previous elements.
