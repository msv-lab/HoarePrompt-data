Postcondition: **`a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\), and must have at least 1 element. `val` is the first element in `a`, which is now 0. `op` is updated by toggling its least significant bit based on the `i`-th bit of `val`, and the current value of `op` is 0. The element `ai` in the list `a` is now the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the original value of `ai` and `val`.**
