Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the maximum profit Bob can make by selling buns, either at a regular price or at a promotional price for the first `k` buns. The promotional price decreases linearly from `b` to `b - k + 1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k` using the formula: `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
   - The formula correctly computes the total profit by summing the profit from the first `k` buns sold at promotional prices and the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the regular price.
   - The function is mathematically sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses a binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - The binary search is appropriate because the profit function is unimodal (it increases to a peak and then decreases).
   - The function initializes `low` and `high` to `0` and `min(n, b)` respectively, ensuring that `k` is within the valid range.
   - The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, and during each iteration, it calculates the profit for the current `mid` and the next `mid + 1`.
   - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it adjusts `low` to `mid + 1` to explore higher values of `k`. Otherwise, it adjusts `high` to `mid - 1` to explore lower values of `k`.
   - The function keeps track of the maximum profit encountered during the search and returns it.

4. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_2` with the appropriate inputs.
   - The output for each test case is the maximum profit calculated by `func_2`.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem and handles all edge cases as described.

Correctness: **True**
