Output State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9\), `w` is the square root of `q`, `i` is 2, and `M` is `[1, q]` if `i` was greater than or equal to `x - 1` (which is always true since `i` is 1), otherwise `M` is `[q]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2.
- The conditions for updating `M` were checked when `i` was 1, and since `i` was 1, it was always greater than or equal to `x - 1` (since `x` is at least 1 and `i` is 1). Therefore, `M` was updated to `[1, q]`.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
