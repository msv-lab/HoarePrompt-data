You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up the Grid:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two binary strings representing the grid rows.
   - This part is correctly implemented and follows the problem's input format.

2. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest String:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` to store the lexicographically smallest string.
   - It iterates through the columns from 0 to `n-2` (since the last column is always included).
   - For each column, it checks if the next cell in the first row is '1' and the current cell in the second row is '0'. If so, it constructs the smallest string by concatenating the prefix of the first row up to the current column and the suffix of the second row from the current column onwards.
   - If no such switch is found, it constructs the string by concatenating the entire first row and the last cell of the second row.
   - This logic ensures that the lexicographically smallest string is found by switching to the second row as soon as possible when it results in a smaller string.

3. **Counting the Number of Paths:**
   - The program initializes a variable `t` to 1, which will count the number of paths that yield the smallest string.
   - It iterates through the columns again to find the point where the smallest string starts to match the first row.
   - If a match is found, it calculates the number of paths by considering the remaining columns.
   - This part is intended to count the number of ways to reach the smallest string, but the logic seems flawed. Specifically, the calculation of `t` does not correctly account for all possible paths.

### Issues:
- **Path Count Calculation:**
  - The logic for counting the number of paths is incorrect. The variable `t` is set to `x - i + 1`, which does not accurately represent the number of paths. The correct approach would involve dynamic programming or combinatorial counting to ensure all valid paths are considered.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly finds the lexicographically smallest string but fails to correctly count the number of paths that yield this string.

### Correctness:
**False**
