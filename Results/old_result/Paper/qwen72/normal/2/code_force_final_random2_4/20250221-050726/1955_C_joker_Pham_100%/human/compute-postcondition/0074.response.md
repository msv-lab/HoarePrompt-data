Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` depending on the condition, and `sunks` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `l` equals `r`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged.
