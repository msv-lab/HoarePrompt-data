The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` forces the flushing of the standard output buffer, ensuring that any buffered data is written to the terminal or output device immediately. This operation does not change any of the variables in the current state.

Output State: **`kp` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is 2, `prev` is the last value of `i` where the input was `>`, or 0 if no input was `>`, `v2` is 2, and `r` is the user input. If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is set to 1.**
