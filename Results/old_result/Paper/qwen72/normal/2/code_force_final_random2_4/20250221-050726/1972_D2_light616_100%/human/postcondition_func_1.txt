The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a positive integer `t` from the user input, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. The function then calls another function `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function completes, `t` remains unchanged, and `func_1` has been executed `t` times. The function itself does not return any value.
