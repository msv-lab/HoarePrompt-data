The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `numCases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `numCases`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `numCases` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so it becomes 2), and `numCases` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers removed from `numbers` until the list is empty.**
