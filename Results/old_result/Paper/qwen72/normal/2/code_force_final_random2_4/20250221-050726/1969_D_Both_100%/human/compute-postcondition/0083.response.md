The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `_` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `k` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` is incremented by 1, so `_` is 2, and `k` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `k` must be greater than 2, `heap` is either an empty list or a list containing the last tuple from `combined` (if `combined` was not empty, it now includes the previously last tuple), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple, and if `combined` was not empty, it is now one element shorter, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0.**
