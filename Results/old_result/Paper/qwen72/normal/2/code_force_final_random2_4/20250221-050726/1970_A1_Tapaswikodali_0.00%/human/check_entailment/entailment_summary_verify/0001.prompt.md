You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join((char for (_, _, char) in details))
    print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a non-empty string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")", which forms a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. It processes this string to maintain a balance count and records details about each character. After processing, it sorts these details and constructs a new string `result` that is also a valid balanced parentheses sequence, potentially in a different order from the original `s`. The function then prints this new string `result`. The final state of the program is that the original string `s` remains unchanged, and the new string `result` is printed to the console.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the input string `s` directly using `input()`. This is appropriate for the problem since the input is expected to be a single line containing a balanced parentheses sequence.

2. **Balance Calculation**: The variable `balance` is used to keep track of the balance of the parentheses sequence as it iterates through the string. For each character:
   - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
   - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   This correctly computes the balance of the prefix up to the current character.

3. **Details Collection**: The function collects the balance, the negative index, and the character itself in a list called `details`. Using the negative index ensures that when sorting, characters with the same balance will be ordered in decreasing order of their original positions.

4. **Sorting**: The `details` list is sorted based on the balance and the negative index. This ensures that the columns are sorted in increasing order of prefix balance and, within the same balance, in decreasing order of position.

5. **Result Construction**: After sorting, the function constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted `details` list and joining them together.

6. **Output**: The result string is printed, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

Given the steps and the logic, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.
