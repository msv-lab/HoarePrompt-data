To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5.
- `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0.
- `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `el` is the last character of `s1` and `el` is '>'.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1 (which is 0).
- `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function Call**: The function `func_1(suffZero, ol)` is called with arguments `suffZero` and `ol`.
   - `suffZero` is a list with a single element `[0]`.
   - `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.

2. **Return Value of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, so we cannot determine its exact behavior. However, we can assume that it returns some value based on the input lists and integers.
   - Let's denote the return value of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` as `result`.

3. **Calculation of `zeroInd`**:
   - `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * result`.

### Impact on Variables:
- `zeroInd` is the only new variable introduced and is set to `2 * result`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

### Output State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5.
- `pre` is a list containing the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0.
- `suffZero` is a list initialized with a single element 0.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `el` is the last character of `s1` and `el` is '>'.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1 (which is 0).
- `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`.
- `zeroInd` is `2 * result` where `result` is the return value of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
