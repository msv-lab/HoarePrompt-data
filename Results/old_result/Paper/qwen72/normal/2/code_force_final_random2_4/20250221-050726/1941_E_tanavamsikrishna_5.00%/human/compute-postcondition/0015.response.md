The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `row` and `d`. `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first and last elements are 0, representing the depths of the river cells in a row. `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= len(row). The function returns the value of the last element in the list `row`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `row` of non-negative integers (with the first and last elements being 0) and a positive integer `d` within the range of the length of `row`. It returns the value of the last element in the list `row`.**
