The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `_` relative to `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `t` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the list `a`.**
