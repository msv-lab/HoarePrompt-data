Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` tuples from `combined` (if `combined` had at least `k` elements), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple, and if `combined` had more than `k` elements, it is now `k` elements shorter, but `combined` must contain at least one element. `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`. If `combined` is not empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`. Otherwise, `current_profit` remains 0. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. Additionally, the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0.**
