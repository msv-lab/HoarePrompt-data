The code snippet `c = a[n:]` assigns to `c` the slice of the list `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list. This means `c` will contain all elements of `a` starting from the element right after the last element included in `b`.

Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `l` has `len(l)` elements, `ans1` includes all elements of `l` up to the point where `k` became 0, `ans2` includes all elements of `l` up to the point where `k` became 0, `k` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `req` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `q` is `len(l)`, `t` must be greater than `len(l)`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end.**
