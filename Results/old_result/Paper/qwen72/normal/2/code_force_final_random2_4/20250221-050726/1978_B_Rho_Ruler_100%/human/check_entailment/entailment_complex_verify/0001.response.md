### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires maximizing the profit from selling `n` buns, where the first `k` buns are sold at a modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.
   - The modified price for the `i-th` bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`.
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated as `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
     - `k * b` is the sum of the prices if all `k` buns were sold at `b` coins each.
     - `k * (k - 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers, which represents the discount applied to the prices of the first `k` buns.
   - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.
   - **Annotation Validation:** The annotations correctly describe the function's behavior and the formula used to calculate the profit.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` to `0` and `min(n, b)` respectively.
   - It iterates using binary search:
     - Calculates the profit for the current midpoint `mid`.
     - Calculates the profit for the next midpoint `mid + 1`.
     - Updates `max_profit` with the maximum of the current profit and the maximum profit found so far.
     - Adjusts the search range based on whether the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`.
   - **Annotation Validation:** The annotations correctly describe the binary search process and the conditions under which the search range is adjusted.

4. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search ensures that we efficiently find the optimal `k` by comparing the profit at the current midpoint and the next midpoint.
   - If the profit at `mid + 1` is greater, it means increasing `k` further might yield a higher profit, so we move the lower bound up.
   - If the profit at `mid + 1` is not greater, it means decreasing `k` might yield a higher profit, so we move the upper bound down.
   - **Annotation Validation:** The annotations correctly describe the logic of the binary search and how it helps in finding the optimal `k`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases where `k` can be `0` or `min(n, b)`.
   - The function correctly calculates the profit for large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` within the constraints.
   - **Annotation Validation:** The annotations confirm that the function handles edge cases and large values correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns. The binary search approach ensures efficiency, and the profit calculation is accurate. The annotations support the correctness of the program.

**Final: **True**
