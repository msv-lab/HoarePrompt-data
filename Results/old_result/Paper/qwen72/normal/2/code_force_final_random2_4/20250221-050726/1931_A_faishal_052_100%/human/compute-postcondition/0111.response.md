The value of `lex` is decremented by 26. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `info`, `arr`) remain unchanged. The specific value of `lex` after the decrement depends on its initial value.

- If `lex` was initially less than 28, then after the decrement, `lex` is now `lex - 26`, which is less than 2 (since 28 - 26 = 2).
- If `lex` was initially between 28 and 52 (inclusive), then after the decrement, `lex` is now `lex - 26`, which is between 2 and 26 (inclusive).
- If `lex` was initially 52 or greater, then after the decrement, `lex` is now `lex - 26`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `lex` is `lex - 26`, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex - 1]]` if `lex` < 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex + 26]]` if `lex` >= 28 and `lex` < 52, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex]]` if `lex` >= 52, `arr` is `[1, 26]` if `lex` < 28, `arr` is `[26, 26]` if `lex` >= 28 and `lex` < 52, `arr` is `[26]` if `lex` >= 52.**
