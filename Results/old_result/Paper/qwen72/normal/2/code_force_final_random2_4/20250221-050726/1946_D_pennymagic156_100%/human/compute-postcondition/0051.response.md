The code snippet `op ^= val >> i & 1` updates the value of `op` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `op` and the 30th bit (from the right, 0-indexed) of `val`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 1 element.
- `t` is an empty list.
- `ans` is -1.
- `i` is 29.
- `u` is 1.
- `v` is even.
- `op` is the XOR of the 30th bit of `val` and the original `op`.
- If `op` is 0, `cnt` is 1; otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.
- `val` is the next element in the list `a`.

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. **Extract the 30th bit of `val`:**
   - The expression `val >> i & 1` shifts `val` right by 29 bits and then performs a bitwise AND with 1, which effectively extracts the 30th bit of `val`.

2. **Update `op`:**
   - The expression `op ^= val >> i & 1` performs a bitwise XOR between the current value of `op` and the extracted 30th bit of `val`.

Since the 30th bit of `val` is either 0 or 1, the value of `op` will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each less than \(2^{30}\) and must have at least 1 element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 1, `v` is even, `op` is the result of the XOR operation between the original `op` and the 30th bit of `val`, if `op` is 0, `cnt` is 1; otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `val` is the next element in the list `a`.**
