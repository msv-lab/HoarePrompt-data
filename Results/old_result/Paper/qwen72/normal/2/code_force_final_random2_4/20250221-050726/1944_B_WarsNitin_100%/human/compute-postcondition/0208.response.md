The code snippet `c.sort()` sorts the list `c` in ascending order. The sorting operation does not affect the values of other variables, but it changes the order of elements within `c`.

Output State: **`i` is the length of `l` minus 1, `ans1` contains all the elements of `l` up to the point where `k` became 0, `ans2` contains the same elements as `ans1`, `k` is 0, `q` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `b` is a sorted sublist of `a` containing the first `n` elements, `c` is a sorted sublist of `a` containing the elements starting from the `n`-th element to the end.**
