Output State: **`el` is the third-to-last character of `s1`, `i` is `n - 3`, `suffZero` has a new element which is `suffZero[-1] + n - 2`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, `ans[n - 3]` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2] - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.
- `i` is `n - 3`, so `ans[n - 3]` is set to the calculated value.
- `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`.
- `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- The final value of `ans[n - 3]` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2] - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
