The value of `num` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `num` was either 2 (if `c == r`) or 3 (if `c != r`). Therefore, the new value of `num` will be 4 if `c == r`, or 5 if `c != r`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` and `k` are integers input by the user with `k` being greater than 1, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are the new integers input by the user, `num` is 4 if `c == r` or 5 if `c != r`, `m` is `n - num`, and if `m` is 0 or 1, the current value of `m` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` initialized with zeros, where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for each `i` from 3 to `m` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).`**
