To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic described:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - `m` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `_` is a placeholder (not used in the logic).
   - `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans` is initially set to True.

2. **Logic:**
   - The code iterates through the list `arr` starting from index 1 (i.e., `j = 1` to `j < m`).
   - For each element `arr[j]`:
     - If `arr[j] < arr[j - 1]`, it means the current element is less than the previous element.
     - In this case, a new list `nums` is created containing the digits of `arr[j - 1]` followed by `arr[j]`.
     - If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False.
     - Otherwise, `arr[j - 1]` is updated to the first digit of `nums`.

3. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the value of `ans`.
   - If `ans` is True, it means the list `arr` was processed without finding any unsorted `nums` lists, and the output will be 'YES'.
   - If `ans` is False, it means at least one `nums` list was found to be unsorted, and the output will be 'NO'.

Given the initial state and the logic, the final output depends on whether the list `arr` was processed without any unsorted `nums` lists being found.

Output: **['NO', 'YES'][ans] (where ans is True if no unsorted nums lists were found, and False otherwise)**

In simpler terms:
- If the list `arr` was processed without any unsorted `nums` lists, the output will be 'YES'.
- If at least one unsorted `nums` list was found, the output will be 'NO'.
