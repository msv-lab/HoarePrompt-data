The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. This operation modifies the list `a` but does not affect the other variables. The values of `ii`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input.**
