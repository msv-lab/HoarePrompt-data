Postcondition: ***`mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`; `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`; `freq` is updated such that the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1 if `(mod_x, mod_y)` was already in `freq`, or set to 1 if it was not initially in `freq`; `beautiful_count` is either 0 or the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` plus the previous value of `beautiful_count` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains unchanged; `results` remains unchanged; `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values of `case['params']`; `case` is now the next element in `test_cases`; `a` is a non-empty list; `num` is the second element of `a`; `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`; `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.***
