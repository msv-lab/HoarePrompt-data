### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings.
   - Each cyclic shift on a substring `[l, r]` costs `r - l + 1`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `s` and converts it to a list of integers.
   - It counts the number of zeros in the string `s` and initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the number of zeros and ones encountered so far.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.
   - It iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - If `c` is 0, it increments the count of zeros in `cnt` and adds 1 to `ans` if there are any ones before the current position.
     - If `c` is 1, it increments the count of ones in `cnt` and adds the remaining number of zeros to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the total cost `ans`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The algorithm correctly counts the number of zeros and ones in the string.
   - It calculates the cost by considering the number of ones before each zero and the number of zeros after each one.
   - This approach ensures that the string is sorted in non-descending order with the minimum cost.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The algorithm handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") by not adding any cost.
   - It also handles the case where the string has no zeros or no ones (e.g., "1111" or "0000").

5. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity is O(n * m), where `n` is the number of test cases and `m` is the length of the string. This is efficient given the constraints.

### Verification Using Function Summary:
- The function summary confirms that the function processes each test case correctly by reading the binary string, converting it to a list of integers, and calculating the cost based on the positions of '0's and '1's.
- The summary also indicates that the function maintains the correct state after processing each test case, ensuring that the next test case is processed independently.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
