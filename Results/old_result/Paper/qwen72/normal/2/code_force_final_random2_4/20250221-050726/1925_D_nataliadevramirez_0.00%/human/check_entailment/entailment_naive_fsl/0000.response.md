Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem's requirement to account for the increase in friendship values during subsequent excursions. Specifically, the program calculates the total sum of friendship values as if the friendship values were constant throughout all excursions, which is incorrect.

### Case Analysis:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
2 1 2
1 2 1
```
- **n = 2**: There are 2 children.
- **m = 1**: There is 1 pair of friends.
- **k = 2**: There are 2 excursions.
- **Friendship**: The pair (1, 2) has an initial friendship value of 1.

### Expected Output:
- For the first excursion, the friendship value of the pair (1, 2) is 1.
- For the second excursion, the friendship value of the pair (1, 2) is 2 (since it was chosen in the first excursion and increased by 1).

Thus, the expected sum of friendship values is \(1 + 2 = 3\).

### Program Output:
The program calculates the total sum as:
\[ 1 \times \left(\frac{2 \times (2 + 1)}{2}\right) = 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

However, the program does not correctly handle the dynamic increase in friendship values for subsequent excursions. It assumes that the friendship value remains constant throughout all excursions, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Calculate the probability of each pair being chosen.
2. Update the friendship values dynamically based on the number of times each pair is chosen.
3. Compute the expected sum of friendship values for all excursions.

The current implementation fails to account for these dynamics, leading to incorrect results for certain test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
