Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case.
   - `case` is the first test case in the list.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`.
   - `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`.
   - `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`.
   - `a` is a list that must have at least 2 elements.
   - `num` is the second element of `a`.
   - `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.
   - `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is incremented by 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(
       f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
   )
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - `num` is the second element of the list `a`.
   - `mod_x` is calculated as `num % x`.
   - `mod_y` is calculated as `num % y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is the same as `mod_y`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` based on the calculations above.

Given the initial state, the output will be:
Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [mod_y] (where num is the second element of the list a, mod_x is the remainder when num is divided by x, mod_y is the remainder when num is divided by y, required_mod_x is (x - mod_x) % x, and required_mod_y is mod_y)**
