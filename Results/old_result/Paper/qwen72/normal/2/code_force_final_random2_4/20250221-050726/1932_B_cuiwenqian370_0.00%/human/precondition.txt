It seems there is a mismatch between the problem description and the provided function definition. The problem is about finding the year when the nth sign occurs, but the function `max_coins_collected(path)` does not match this context. I will provide the correct function definition and the precondition based on the problem description.

### Corrected Function Definition
```python
def year_of_apocalypse(t, n, a):
```

### Precondition
**t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).**
