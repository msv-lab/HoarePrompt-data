The function `func_1` does not explicitly define parameters in its signature, but based on the given constraints, it should accept three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `n`. Here are the details:

- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 10^8.
- `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x.

However, since the output is not specified, I cannot determine the exact return value of the function. Assuming the function is designed to perform some operation based on these parameters, the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `n`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, and `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided.**
