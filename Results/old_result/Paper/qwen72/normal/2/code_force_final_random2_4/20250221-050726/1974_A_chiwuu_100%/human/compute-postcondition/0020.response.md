Postcondition: ***`t` is updated based on the divisibility of `t2` by 15. If `t2` is a multiple of 15, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`. In both cases, `t1` is recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, and `t2` is recalculated as `a - t1`. The values of `x` and `y` remain integers within the range 0 to 99, `n` remains greater than 0, `i` remains 0, `a` and `b` retain their integer values (converted from their original string values), and `t1` remains less than `a`.***
