The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because the loop starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

Given that `i` is initially set to `n - 2`, this does not affect the loop's ability to start, but it is not relevant to the loop head. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
