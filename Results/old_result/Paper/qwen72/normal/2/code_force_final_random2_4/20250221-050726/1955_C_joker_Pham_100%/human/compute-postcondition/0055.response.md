Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 0 or 1, and `r` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` depending on the condition. `sunks` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `a[r] < a[l]`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[r]`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`, and if `a[l]` becomes 0, `l` is updated to either 1 or 2, and `sunks` is updated to either 2, 3, or 4. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k` is less than `2 * a[r]`, then `sunks` remains either 0, 1, or 2, `k` is set to 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged.***
