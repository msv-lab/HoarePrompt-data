To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`.
   - `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.

2. **Understanding `ans`:**
   - `ans` is computed by iterating over each element `x` in the list `cnt`.
   - For each element `x`, the expression `max(0, x - 1)` is evaluated.
     - If `x - 1` is positive, it is added to `ans`.
     - If `x - 1` is negative or zero, 0 is added to `ans`.
   - The final value of `ans` is the sum of these results.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.

Since the exact values of `cnt` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of max(0, x - 1) for all elements x in cnt)**
