The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts no direct parameters within its definition but expects input through other means (e.g., standard input or predefined variables). Each test case includes an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, where `n` is within the range of 1 to 10^6, and `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters. The function processes each test case and returns a result specific to each case. The total number of test cases `t` is an integer within the range of 1 to 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. It returns a result for each test case, handling up to 10^4 test cases where the sum of `n` across all cases does not exceed 10^6.**
