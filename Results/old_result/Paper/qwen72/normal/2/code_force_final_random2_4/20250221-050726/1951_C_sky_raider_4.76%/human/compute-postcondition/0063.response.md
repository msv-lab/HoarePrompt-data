Functionality: ** The function reads multiple sets of inputs, each set containing the number of sale days (`n`), the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day (`m`), the number of tickets to be bought (`k`), and a list of ticket prices for each day (`a`). It calculates and prints the minimum total cost required to buy exactly `k` tickets over `n` days, considering the constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought each day and the varying prices. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value, but it prints the calculated minimum cost for each test case. **
