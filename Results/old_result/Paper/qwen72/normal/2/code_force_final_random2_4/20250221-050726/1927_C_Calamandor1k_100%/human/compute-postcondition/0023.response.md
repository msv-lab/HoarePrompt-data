The only objects in the loop head are the variables `(n, m, k, a, b)` and the list `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `cases`. If there are more tuples in `cases`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `cases` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple `(n, m, k, a, b)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `cases` must contain at least two tuples. After the last iteration, the first tuple in `cases` has been processed, so the next tuple to be processed is the second one in the list.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state should be:
- `cases` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples.
- The next tuple to be processed is the second tuple in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples (n, m, k, a, b), `results` is a list that contains the string 'YES' if the number of elements in `only_b` is not greater than `k // 2` and `total_distinct` is less than `k`. `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`. `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`.**
