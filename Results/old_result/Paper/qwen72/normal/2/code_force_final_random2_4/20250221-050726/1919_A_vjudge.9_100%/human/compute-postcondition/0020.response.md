Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). It then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even. If it is, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice". After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that `t` remains unchanged, `i` is `t-1`, and `a` and `b` hold the values from the last test case. **
