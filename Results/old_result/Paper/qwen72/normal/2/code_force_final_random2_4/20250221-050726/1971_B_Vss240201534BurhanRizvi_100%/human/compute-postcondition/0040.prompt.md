You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each iteration, `s` was a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. For each `s` input during the loop: If the length of `s` was 1, the program did nothing. If the length of `s` was greater than 1 and all characters in `s` were the same, the program did nothing. Otherwise, `s2` was a shuffled version of `s`. If `s` was equal to `s2`, then `s2` was the string formed by moving the first character of `s` to the end. The loop executed `t` times, and the final state of `s` and `s2` for each iteration depends on the specific input provided.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s`, a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. The function's return value is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
