Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`. `a` is a list of `k` unique integers in strictly increasing order (1 <= k <= 100, 1 <= a[i] <= 100), and `b` is a list of `q` integers (1 <= q <= 100, 1 <= b[i] <= 100). If the condition `a <= b` is true, the function attempts to return `a - 1`, which results in a `TypeError` because `a` is a list and cannot be subtracted by an integer. If the condition `a <= b` is false, the function returns the list `b`. In summary, the function either raises a `TypeError` or returns the list `b`. **
