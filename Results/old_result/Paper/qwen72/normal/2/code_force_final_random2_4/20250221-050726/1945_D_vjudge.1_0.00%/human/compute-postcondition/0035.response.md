To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and `k`.

Given:
- `n` is greater than `k`.
- `i` is `n - k`.
- The loop iterates from `n - k` to `n - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` was `n - k`.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `n - k + 1`.

The conditions for the loop to continue executing are:
- `i` must be less than `n`.

Since `n` and `k` remain unchanged, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `i` is `n - k + 1`, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `lista_B` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and `lista_B` is in its original order, `lista_A` is a list of integers provided by the user input and has been reversed, `soma_b` is the sum of the last `n - k - 1` elements of `lista_B` that were not less than the corresponding elements in `lista_A` plus `lista_B[i]` plus `lista_B[i]`, `pref` is the sum of the elements in `lista_A` that were less than the corresponding elements in `lista_B` plus the accumulated `soma_b` values from previous iterations, `resultado` is the minimum value between the previous `resultado` and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`.**
