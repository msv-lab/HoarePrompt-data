The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` appends the integer `b` to the list located at index `a` in the `adj` list. This operation modifies the `adj` list, specifically the sublist at index `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where `adj[a]` now contains `[b]`, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers.**
