Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must contain at least three elements, `pl` is a list that now definitely contains the integer `i` (the third element in `palka` that exists in the dictionary `d` with a non-None value), `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is either set to 1 or incremented by 1 depending on whether `i` was already in `d`, `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, and `i` is the third element in `palka` that exists in the dictionary `d` with a non-None value.***
