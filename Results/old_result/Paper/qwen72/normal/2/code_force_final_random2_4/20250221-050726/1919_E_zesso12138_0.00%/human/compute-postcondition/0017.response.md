Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (greater than 0) - 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers extracted from `data[index:index + n]` and converted to integers, `data` is a list of strings from the input split by whitespace, `index` is 3 + 2 * `n`, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by `n`.
- Initially, `index` was 3 + `n`.
- After the increment, `index` becomes 3 + `n` + `n`, which simplifies to 3 + 2 * `n`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `data`, `results`, `result`) remain unchanged.
