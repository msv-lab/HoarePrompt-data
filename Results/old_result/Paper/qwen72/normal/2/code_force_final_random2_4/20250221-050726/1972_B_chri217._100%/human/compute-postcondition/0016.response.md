Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list named `cases` containing `t` tuples, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. Each tuple in the list is of the form `(n, s)`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U' and 'D', and has been stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**
