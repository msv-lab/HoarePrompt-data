The value of `c` is updated by adding the product of `s` and the sum of `l[i]` and `t`. Given that `i` is 0, `t` is 0, and `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, the calculation is `c += s * (l[0] + 0)`, which simplifies to `c += s * l[0]`. Therefore, the new value of `c` is `s * l[0]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `t` is 0, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * l[0]`.**
