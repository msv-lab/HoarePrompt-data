Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is 1, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 1 and `pans` is `[1]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[1]`. For any other value of `s`, `pans` is `[0]` if `s` is `<`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list.***
