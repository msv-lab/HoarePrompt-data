The code snippet `x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to `x` and `n` respectively.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 10^8
- `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x

After executing the code:
- The new values of `x` and `n` are determined by the input provided.
- The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers provided by the input, and 1 <= n <= x.**
