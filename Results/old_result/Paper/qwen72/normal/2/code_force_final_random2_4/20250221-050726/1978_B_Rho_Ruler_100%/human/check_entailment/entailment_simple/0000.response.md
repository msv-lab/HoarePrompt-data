Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum profit Bob can make by selling buns under the given promotion rules. Let's break down the components and logic to ensure correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The main block reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, reading `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case. This part is straightforward and correctly handles the input format.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k` using the formula:
     \[
     \text{profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
     \]
   - The formula is derived from the problem statement:
     - The first `k` buns are sold at prices `b, b-1, b-2, ..., b-k+1`, which sums to \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \).
     - The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `(n - k) * a` to the profit.
   - This function is mathematically correct and matches the problem requirements.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` to `0` and `min(n, b)` respectively, ensuring `k` is within the valid range.
   - It iterates using a binary search approach:
     - For each midpoint `mid`, it calculates the profit for `k = mid` and `k = mid + 1`.
     - It updates `max_profit` with the maximum of the current `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.
     - It adjusts `low` and `high` based on whether `profit_next` (for `k = mid + 1`) is greater than `profit_mid`.
   - The loop terminates when `low` exceeds `high`, ensuring that the maximum profit is found.

4. **Output**:
   - The main block prints the result of `func_2` for each test case, which is the maximum profit for that case.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit for each test case. The binary search ensures efficient computation even for large values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Correctness: **True**
