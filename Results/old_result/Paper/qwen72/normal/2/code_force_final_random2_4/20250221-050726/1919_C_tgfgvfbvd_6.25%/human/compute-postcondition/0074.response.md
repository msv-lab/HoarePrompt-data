Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or `n-1` if no such element exists, `a` is the last element in `l` that was greater than or equal to the previous elements up to the point where it was updated, `b` is the last element in `l` that was greater than the previous elements up to the point where it was updated, and `c` is the count of how many times an element in `l` was found to be greater than both `a` and `b` during the loop execution.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `l`.
- The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer, and the new list `l` is now populated with `n` integers read from the input.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `y`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code snippet provided.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `l` while maintaining the initial conditions for the other variables.
