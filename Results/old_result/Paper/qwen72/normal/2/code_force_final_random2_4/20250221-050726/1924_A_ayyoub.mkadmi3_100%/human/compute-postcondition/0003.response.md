To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

- The loop iterates over each character `i` in the string `s`.
- For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 26).
- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 26).
- The sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
- `s1` is an empty string.
- `s2` is an empty string.
- `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which is derived from the string `s`.

For the loop to execute:
- `s` must be non-empty, meaning `m` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `s` is non-empty and `i` is the first character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `m` must be at least 1, `i` is the first character of `s`, `s1` is an empty string, `s2` is an empty string, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets**.
