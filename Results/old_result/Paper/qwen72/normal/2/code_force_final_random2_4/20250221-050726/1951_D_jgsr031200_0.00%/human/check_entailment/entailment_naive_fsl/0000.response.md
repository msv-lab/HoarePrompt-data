Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to correctly set up the stalls and prices for certain inputs. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
n = 7, k = 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
10
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
2
YES
6 2
```

The program outputs `2` stalls with prices `6` and `2`, which does not ensure that Alice buys exactly 3 jewels. In this case, Alice would buy 1 jewel from the first stall (spending 6 coins) and 1 jewel from the second stall (spending 2 coins), leaving her with 1 coin and only 2 jewels in total, which does not meet the requirement of buying exactly 3 jewels.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not handle this specific case correctly.
