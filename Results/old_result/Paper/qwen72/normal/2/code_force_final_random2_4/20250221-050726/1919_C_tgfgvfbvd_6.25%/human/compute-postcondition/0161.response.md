Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is 3, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is the fourth element in `l`, and `c` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `b = l[y]` assigns the value of the fourth element in the list `l` (since `y` is 3) to the variable `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
